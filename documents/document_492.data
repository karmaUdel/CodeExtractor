U5ABF3BH7 : <@U3HQVHERX> The following code provides a string already
U5ABF3BH7 : ```div [ class "col-xs-7" ]   [ select [ class "select form-control", onInput (config.toMsg (AddressMsg Address.ChgCountry)), value config.model.address.country ]
       AddressHelper.countryOptions
   ]```

U5ABF3BH7 : since it is a select
U3HQVHERX : what about `onInput (config.toMsg (AddressMsg Address.ChgCountry))` --&gt; `onInput Address.ChgCountry` and change type to `Html msg`
U57KYFW67 : Ack. What is the command to genreate a new elm-package.json file?
U5ABF3BH7 : It doesn't work either, it needs to be wrapped.
U3HQVHERX : <@U57KYFW67> `elm-repl` will make one incidentally i think
U57KYFW67 : oh, I had an elm-stuff directory!
U3HQVHERX : i'll test this out and see what I find :slightly_smiling_face:
U3HQVHERX : <https://gist.github.com/nqthqn/5843404710c279427203a582a1bef488>
U3HQVHERX : So if you have a module `Foo` that exposes `Msg` and `update` you can do this in the place you are using the module
```
type Msg
    = Bar
    | FooMsg Foo.Msg
```

then pattern match just as you are doing.

And in the view:

`button [ onClick (FooMsg Foo.Uno) ] [ text "Foo.Uno" ]`

U3HQVHERX : oh wait, you have a string
U3HQVHERX : my bad
U3HQVHERX : <@U5ABF3BH7> try: `onInput (\s -&gt; AddressMsg (Address.ChgCountry s) )`
U57KYFW67 : Why is `@docs` required at the top of a file for an exported binding?
U57KYFW67 : What does `@docs` do that simply annotating the name with a `{-| ... -}` style comment not?
U5ABF3BH7 : <@U3HQVHERX> Ah! I didn't think of doing that way!
U5ABF3BH7 : Thanks
U153UK3FA : <@U57KYFW67> <http://package.elm-lang.org/help/documentation-format>
U57KYFW67 : Does that let you control the ordering and grouping of the docs then?
U153UK3FA : yep
U57KYFW67 : gotcha
U57KYFW67 : And the answer to this is probably "no", but is there any way in Elm reactor to pass a JSON object for a `Program` that requires `Flag`s?
U153UK3FA : there isn't
U635238TG : has anyone done the two Elm tutorials by James Moore on knowthen? I'm going to start the elm for beginners course tomorrow. I'm wondering if this and the Elm Beyond the Basics are going to be good for someone not just new to Elm but actually mostly new to programming in general.
U20K0C2G4 : <@U635238TG> they're good
U20K0C2G4 : you've made a good choice choosing elm to start programming, although most of the benefits that elm provides may not be as relevant, you'll get to a working application much quicker than with anything in the JavaScript world
U635238TG : thank you! I'm excited. $45 is a little rich in my present circumstances but there is just not that many Elm learning resources out there. I also just got the Elm in Action book by Richard Feldman. I'm just straight into this thing.
U20K0C2G4 : yea Richard Feldman's resources are great too
U57KYFW67 : <@U635238TG> If you have no programming experience, you may be at a small kind of advantage, too, over some other programmers.
U57KYFW67 : Elm is very different than most languages (being what we call a pure functional language). And old hat programmers spend a lot of time having to unlearn a lot of what they expect when coming into such a language.
U20K0C2G4 : honestly I'm curious, <@U635238TG> how did you find Elm?
U635238TG : yeah, i kind of got that sense too. i did a little javascript stuff but I don't think enough to come away with any habits or modes of thinking yet.
U635238TG : i basically wanted to explore web development but quickly grew to dislike this whole javascript landscape. all the criticisms people were saying made sense to me and then Elm just popped up as kind of solving all these in a neat package.
U57KYFW67 : That sounds like a good situation to try using Elm, I'd say
U635238TG : i figure it is a great language to learn good, safe habits of programming now and will make it easier going forward if I want to bring the functional programming mindset to other languages. the compiler is like my little robot buddy helping me along the way!
U635238TG : i hope others find decent runarounds for using it on the server side by the time I get to that point so I can just keep getting better in this language before having to branch out. haskell seems way intimidating but I'm drinking the fp approach kool-aid. maybe elixir. the timeline talks on elm development make it seem like it might be years down the road before it is an official capability.  I totally buy into the slow, thought out development approach of the language though
U57KYFW67 : There's lots of relatively easy server-side technologies you can use for Elm.
U57KYFW67 : Elm can host simple pages on its own with Elm Reactor
U57KYFW67 : The default output of elm make is just .html or .js files, so you could statically host them with, say, nginx or any other webserver
U57KYFW67 : Or you can try out a simple framework like Python's Flask, and that would give you more than enough to get started.
U635238TG : i was actually hoping there would be smaller use case simple solutions like that. i'm not even that far in my learning yet so that is good to hear.
U57KYFW67 : (If you like the coolaid, I think there are also some simple Haskell web frameworks)
U635238TG : and elm is supposed to be a great intro to fp so maybe i could do that. i think the one recommended is called scotty
U20K0C2G4 : I'm doing F# with Azure Functions on the server
U57KYFW67 : Yeah. Scotty is the one.
U635238TG : i think it will be a lot of fun to grow with this language.
U20K0C2G4 : but I'm coming from a .net work environment
U57KYFW67 : <@U20K0C2G4> What seems to be the issue?
U20K0C2G4 : I'm just chiming in, thought you were talking about server side technologies
U57KYFW67 : ahh, sorry. I misread.
U20K0C2G4 : as far as Elm though, I've started investigating style-elements package
U20K0C2G4 : I think they are on to something
U20K0C2G4 : I just don't fully understand it yet
U20K0C2G4 : <@U57KYFW67> have you looked into it?
U57KYFW67 : It's on my todo list.
U635238TG : i am curious on why since Elm transpiles to js you can't use it to write code as node.js?
U57KYFW67 : A long term goal of Elm is to develop it as its own platform. Even though it compiles to JS today, eventually, it might compile to something else.
U57KYFW67 : So the problem isn't that it's not possible
U57KYFW67 : In fact, the elm-node package does pretty much exactly that
U57KYFW67 : But it does not meet the quality standards to be considered "part of Elm" quite yet.
U635238TG : ahh. i was just coming at it with a mindset that if node is just js then you could just use Elm for everything you could use js for.
U635238TG : also curious why someone can't take the js generated from Elm and edit it as if it was originally written in js and no one is the wiser.
U57KYFW67 : The code generation is the easy part. The libraries are the tricky part.  :slightly_smiling_face:
U57KYFW67 : You very well could. But machine-generated code is usually very hard to work with.
U57KYFW67 : and once you change it, you might as well delete the Elm code, because recompiling will overwrite your changes
U635238TG : thanks for the patient answers! i'm going to be talking you folks' ears off as I learn all this. all the beginner programmers I know are pretty much going the js or python route
U0ZRNV5M3 : i think the "elm as its own platform" scenario is a really big deal
U57KYFW67 : <@U0ZRNV5M3> It's an ideal lots of languages have tried. It's just a matter of sticking to your guns :slightly_smiling_face:
U0ZRNV5M3 : exactly. a lot of the most exciting aspects of using elm werent features people were clamoring for necessarily
U57KYFW67 : <@U635238TG> It's not a bad idea to know Javascript or Python. Javascript is central to web development, as it's currently the only language browsers universally understand. (And Python is just merciful for a language for beginners).
U0ZRNV5M3 : i think evan's hope isnt to build a better way to write javascript, but a better way to create stuff
U635238TG : i figure i will learn some javascript as needed while i progress along. i'm set on getting a solid foundation in Elm as my first language and focus on that first and foremost as I do believe in the approach and think it will make me a stronger developer at the foundation level over the long run.
U635238TG : also taking html/css tutorials to get that down too
U3SJEDR96 : Yes, actually. It requires some fiddling, tho - I wrote about it. <https://blog.ilias.xyz>
U57KYFW67 : Thanks. I'll take a look.
U61FZV5EK : Hey. I have a list of anchors i want to tab through or click on. When tabbing, I want the element to have an outline, but not when I click on them. Is there some clever way to achieve this without messing with the model?
U2W8CSAQ7 : What's the easiest way to add copy-to-clipboard functionality in an Elm app these days?
U57KYFW67 : afaik, I think you probably need a port and delegate it to JS, <@U2W8CSAQ7>
U153UK3FA : I think there might be an issue with doing it like that due to browser restrictions
U57KYFW67 : You mean an issue using a port?
U153UK3FA : oh, I mean you'll need to use that port to attach an event handler to a DOM element before the user clicks it
U153UK3FA : I think interacting with the clipboard can only be done while handling an event
U3SJEDR96 : yeah, it can't happen asynchronously, which is how ports work due to the scheduler getting involved
U57KYFW67 : ah, yeah
U6A6Z5LMT : Anyone know How to declare a record type with optional keys see <https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/6nwg53/record_type_with_optional_keys/>
U3SJEDR96 : I think Evan's answer there is one of read carefully. The key point is that a type alias for a record describes a certain shape, and only that shape. If you want to be able to access those fields type-safely, they need to be in the record, with a given type.
U3SJEDR96 : A datastructure that _may_ have a value of a certain type for a given key is also offered, and that would be a Dict or an Array (Array Foo)
U604S603Y : I'm still having a brain knot in working with one part of The Elm Architecture:I'm storing my `Session` in the top-level model of my Elm app so I can pass it in to all the functions that need to run authenticated against the server.
I have a `Login` submodule I'm using at different locations in my app.
After logging in successfully I want to emit a (top level) Message in the `Login` submodule along the lines of `SetSession newSession` which I then want to handle in the top-level `update` function.
But I have no idea how to "emit" a simple message I just constructed wrapped in a `Cmd` from my submodule's `update` function.
Is this even possible in Elm? Is it advised? Are there better patterns for that?

U3SJEDR96 : So basically, when you call `Login.update`, you wish to know something extra: did this action log me in or not. Right?
U604S603Y : yes
U3SJEDR96 : Right, so when you wish to get back some extra piece of info from a function, what would you normally do? (try to think of it as _just_ a function - `update` isn't special, and especially if it's in a sub-module, its signature doesn't need to conform to anything)
U604S603Y : I was thinking of returning the `Session` data as another part of the `Tuple` of Login's `update`.  But then I have to return it from every branch of the update function in some way or another
U604S603Y : which would result in a lot of branches with Nothing for the Maybe Session part of it
U3SJEDR96 : true, but you also return `Cmd.none` from all the branches that don't happen to create side-effects. Adding a third piece of info, which could just be a `Bool`, shouldn't be that bad?
U604S603Y : true
U2W8CSAQ7 : Thanks! I tried <https://claytonflesher.github.io/2016/11/01/copy-to-clipboard.html> now, and it seems to work allright though.
U604S603Y : but there's a second challenge I face going in the same direction:wanting to update the page's title from every page - I have a `ChangePageTitle String` message for that already, which I'd like to emit from all other pages. I could call the Port for that directly but then I'd duplicate the Port call to everywhere which I don't really want.

U3SJEDR96 : Alternatively, you could change the structure alltogether and return a `{ model : Model, effects : Cmd Msg, loggedIn : Bool }`, and have functions to create that record from just a model, or a model and effects, or a model, effects and a bool
U3SJEDR96 : do the titles change within a single page, or is it "1 page -&gt; 1 title"?
U57KYFW67 : cool cool :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : in the second case, you can have a `title : String` function in every page module, and call that when switching to that page
U3SJEDR96 : though personally, I feel like the page-title is part of the top-level state, rather than sometihng to be decided by the individual pages. I'm not sure, actually, I could see it going both ways.. :thinking_face:
U604S603Y : problem is: I only know the page title after the page has loaded its data from the server - because I want something like 'Element XYZ @ MyCoolTool' as title - but the name of the element comes from the server
U604S603Y : so at the moment I have a pattern matching on all the pages where I return the page's initial `Cmd` (either a `RemoteData.Http` call or `Cmd.none`) which is then returned as the "Command to run" in the UrlChanged message handler
U3SJEDR96 : Right. Richard handled that type of thing using an `init` that returns a `Task` for the data-initialization, which was pretty neat. Thinking about this some more; I think this is how I would handle this:1. have a single `emit : Json.Value -&gt; Cmd msg` port
2. create a `setPageTitle : String -&gt; Cmd msg` function, which adds the standard suffix to the title, json encodes it into an object like `{ "action" = "setTitle", "title" = "foo @ bar" }`
3. have a single subscription to that port on the JS side, which  has a good ol `switch` case on `msg.action`
4. call that `setPageTitle` function wherever you want to change the title

U604S603Y : but wouldn't that spread the Port call throughout all my code? I still feel Ports are dirty and wanted to have the call only at one place in my code
U604S603Y : your solution is nice and pragmatic (and I will probably do it that way)
U3SJEDR96 : ports are an excellent way to consider JS a remote API. If you can have http requests in multiple places, you can have port calls in multiple places. Minimizing the API surface by using a single outbound port tends to ensure you have a clear code-path, and using a helper-function to get the data in the correct format ensures correctness
U3SJEDR96 : `setPageTitle input = Json.object [ ( "action", Json.string "setTitle" ), ( "title", Json.string (input ++ " @ MyCoolTool") ) ] |&gt; emit`
U3SJEDR96 : I think you could put that into a separate module together with `emit`, and simply not expose `emit`
U3SJEDR96 : (if only to prevent yourself from calling `emit` directly somewhere down the line)
U5R6L5MT4 : What can I do to solve a RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
U5R6L5MT4 : It happens at execution time
U604S603Y : I will do that. Thanks a lot <@U3SJEDR96>
U3SJEDR96 : <@U5R6L5MT4>: sudoku? I can have a look at it
U5R6L5MT4 : Yes
U5R6L5MT4 : In this repository: <https://github.com/Natim/elm-sudoku/compare/broken-one?expand=1>
U5R6L5MT4 : The main works (with the same Sudoku as your example)
U5R6L5MT4 : But then with the one I configured in broken-one it fails with the RangeError
U5R6L5MT4 : s/main/master
U3SJEDR96 : Yeah, it's probably a recursion issue - recursing too deep can result in that, especially if each stack-frame adds quite a bit of data
U5R6L5MT4 : Yes it is probably that then
U5R6L5MT4 : But recursion is what we want for functional languages :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : sure, but more importantly, you want tail call elimination, so it can compile to a `while` :wink:
U5R6L5MT4 : Should I change some of the recursion to use <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Chadtech/elm-loop/latest> instead?
U3SJEDR96 : no.
U5R6L5MT4 : How shall I do to compilte to a while?
U3SJEDR96 : <https://evancz.gitbooks.io/functional-programming-in-elm/recursion/tail-call-elimination.html>
U4872964V : a reason could be that you have a bug that makes your recursion be infinite too
U4872964V : if you look at the stack trace for the exception there may be a clue there
U5R6L5MT4 : <@U4872964V> In that case I don't think so because other sudoku do solve themselves
U5R6L5MT4 : <@U3SJEDR96> so basically it is about using case list of first :: rest -&gt; and then using foldr?
U14Q8S4EM : Yeah dont use my package. It wont help you.
U4872964V : <@U5R6L5MT4> maybe so but the stack trace might give a clue anyway. The big may be a special case for a certain board
U5R6L5MT4 : <@U4872964V> Do you mean the stacktrace of the exception?
U5R6L5MT4 : RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded    at sudoku/elm.js:7:40

U3SJEDR96 : brute_force -&gt; resolveSudoku -&gt; increment_sudoku -&gt; brute_force -&gt; ...
U5V5B3F9N : Hi all :wave: a silly question perhaps, but I can't find the answer: does record update syntax `{ model | key = updated_value }` exist for *opaque* types `type MyType = MyType { key1 : String, key2 : Bool }`? I'd like to update the latter with something like `MyType { myType | key2 = True }` but I can't find a shorthand way to update my opaque type other than destructuring it in its entirety and then restructuring it.
U3SJEDR96 : You have to destructure and restructure, though you can do so in a few ways that make it _not that painful_: <https://ellie-app.com/3MvVD38RbyDa1/0>
U5V5B3F9N : Ah, the trick is in the additional `alias` declaration <@U3SJEDR96>? Many thanks!
U3SJEDR96 : oh, no, the alias isn't relevant
U3SJEDR96 : the trick is in destructuring :stuck_out_tongue:
U3SJEDR96 : <https://ellie-app.com/3MvVD38RbyDa1/1> &lt;- getting rid of the type alias for that record doesn't change anything :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : pattern matching on `(MyType variableForTheContent)` is the trick
U5V5B3F9N : Aha, I would have sworn I tried that syntax, buy apparently not :slightly_smiling_face: I like the Ellie editor by the way; hadn't come across that before
U2M4VPZ9D : Hi <@U69EMCAKA> !!!
U2D07QZN3 : If I have a list of widgets, should I call them "widgits" or "widgetList"?
U4872964V : widgets
U4872964V : (totally my own opinion of course)
U2D07QZN3 : Thanks.  Do you think that is the common way?
U57KYFW67 : I think either way is just as well
U57KYFW67 : widgets is shorter. go with that.
U4872964V : if you don't like the names, it's super easy to change them later, I do that all the time
U30J8RTKJ : Hi, I'm working on simple board game, what is the best elm package for complex drag and drop stuff? I've found few but I'm not sure which one to pick, any hints?
U3SJEDR96 : <@U5R6L5MT4> looking at it a little closer; you'll want to get rid of `brute_force` and `resolveSudoku`, and integrate their logic into `increment_sudoku`. It's running now, but certainly takes a while :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : (±136 seconds, apparently)
U3SJEDR96 : fwiw, my published solver does it in 9, and I have an alternate solver (I should commit and push that, really) does it in &lt;1s
U5R6L5MT4 : Nice
U5R6L5MT4 : 136 seconds it is quite a while
U3SJEDR96 : yeah, though that sudoku is a degenerate case that required a _lot_ of backtracking :slightly_smiling_face:
U5R6L5MT4 : I actually found it in a book
U5WD40ZA9 : Is it possible to run a command after the view function has run?
U6ASZU4EB : if I have the following method declaration:checkboxConditional : List (Form ValidationError a, Html Msg) -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; Form ValidationError a -&gt; Html Msg
checkboxConditional elements title name form 

How can I output "elements" inside of a div? I've tried "div [] elements" but the compiler says:
Function `div` is expecting the 2nd argument to be:
List (Html msg)
But it is:List ( Form ValidationError a, Html Msg )

U4GU5J9JR : I've got this knot in my head. I am thinking that it should be possible to _resolve_ a list of maybes into a list containing only the values. If the initial list contains only Nothings then the output is the empty list. So I am thinking that it is possible to write a function of type `resolve : List (Maybe GreatStuffType) -&gt; List GreatStuffType`, but is it? I haven't yet found a solution in the stdlib and I am not able to get the compiler to accept that I have actually resolved by excluding Nothings.
U3SJEDR96 : <@U4GU5J9JR> it's definitely possible :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : so, there is a function `List.filterMap : (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; List a -&gt; List b` that applies a function, and only keeps the ones that result in a `Just`, discarding `Nothing`'s. Now, in your case, you already have a `List (Maybe a)`, so you need a function `Maybe a -&gt; Maybe a`.. or even more general, a function `a -&gt; a`, which happens to exist and be called `identity`.
U3SJEDR96 : so you can implement resolve like this: `resolve = List.filterMap identity`
U4GU5J9JR : I am thinking: `div [] &lt;| List.map second elements`
U4GU5J9JR : greatstuff indeed, <@U3SJEDR96> thank you!
U3SJEDR96 : There are some other options, too; for example <https://ellie-app.com/3MzcYwh9rRVa1/0>
U0JBSEGHY : is anyone familiar with create-elm-app??
U0JBSEGHY : Or just webpack in general?
U681TBBUP : I believe create-elm-app is deprecated
U0JBSEGHY : ok
U3SJEDR96 : what? why would it be?
U0JBSEGHY : whats the best way to create elm apps?
U3SJEDR96 : <@U10P4FNMD> is still actively developing, maintaining and supporting `create-elm-app`
U0JBSEGHY : Man I hate webpack lol
U681TBBUP : <@U0JBSEGHY> yeah I lied I thought I read that somewhere
U3SJEDR96 : Personally, I tend to just use `elm-reactor`, and occasionally go for `elm-live`
U0JBSEGHY : it
U0JBSEGHY : it just seems to be way more hassle than it is worth
U0JBSEGHY : I really hope Evan creates some dope tooling so webpack isn't necessary
U3SJEDR96 : What do you currently need webpack for?
U3SJEDR96 : I wouldn't call it necessary by a long shot :stuck_out_tongue:
U0JBSEGHY : I'm building something with Twilio.
U2LC0U8JY : I am not sure if evan can keep up with the progress of webpack or whatever comes next :wink:
U0JBSEGHY : So the hot module replacement is super handy. And it needs to work with ports.
U2LC0U8JY : so its good to have these options
U0JBSEGHY : Because twilio is useless and has a poorly designed client sdk
U0JBSEGHY : I shouldn't be so harsh haha
U0JBSEGHY : I'll rephrase that to the Twilio client is painful
U0JBSEGHY : I'm basically confused by the generated index.js of `create-elm-app`
U0JBSEGHY : This is the file ```
require('./main.css');
var logoPath = require('./logo.svg');
var Elm = require('./Main.elm');

var root = document.getElementById('root');

Elm.Main.embed(root, logoPath);
```
Any variables of functions I define I can't get access to in the console on the browser

U0JBSEGHY : I'm not quite sure how the magic works and am concerned about having to learn many hours of webpack for something so simple lol
U5R6L5MT4 : <@U3SJEDR96> do you have your patch at hand?
U5R6L5MT4 : The one merging everything in incrementSudoku

U5WD40ZA9 : Is there anyway to run a command after elm is done with running the view function?
U3SJEDR96 : you'll have to ignore the whitespace changes for that to make sense :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : <@U5WD40ZA9> what's your use-case?
U3SJEDR96 : this feels a little like an xy-problem :slightly_smiling_face:
U5WD40ZA9 : <@U3SJEDR96> I want to insert a chart with the help of javascript. This requires that the element already exists in the dom before I try to insert the graph.
