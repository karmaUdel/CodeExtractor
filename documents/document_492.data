That's going to take me a while to parse!  Thanks.
head == asplode :slightly_smiling_face:
the only real complicated part is what I"m doing there with filterMap
honestly I'm playing code golf here, that could easily be broken out to make it more readable
I have to head home, but thanks, again, for your help!

<@U2Q3QE54G> have you tested the same functionlity in js -  to make sure that what you have there is not a browser problem ?!
Hi! Do you think it would possible somehow to use Elm as a desktop native application in order to get access to local files, directories, etc?
`elm-native-ui` seems to be mobile oriented
I never tried but maybe you should look at electon elm
ho thanks, I found this <https://medium.com/@ezekeal/building-an-electron-app-with-elm-part-1-boilerplate-3416a730731f>
Gnome3 extensions are in JS
there might be some bridges there
I need a crossplatform solution (at least windows and linux)
<@U0JL9RPC4> See also <#C0K90DV3M|electron>. Recent discussion in <#C0K8VHA6B|help> too.
OK, I assumed you knew about <#C0K90DV3M|electron> and was offering other ideas :smiley:
