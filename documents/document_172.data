U04S09GLN : Does the slack api allow for “so and so is typing” status updates, so you can simulate a response being thought about?
U04SM6T2H : The bot sends messages at most every 2 seconds
U04SM6T2H : we have a “game loop” type thing
U04SM6T2H : where every 2 secnods, all the active “tasks” tick
U04SM6T2H : and if a conversation in the task has a pending mesage, it sends
U04SM6T2H : BUT YES
U04SM6T2H : the gifs are a bit fast
U04SM6T2H : Congrats <@U04SS2NBF>!! <https://medium.com/@buster/give-me-some-slack-b27d19512a65>
U04S1QCPC : :open_mouth:
U04S09GLN : whoa awesome! <@U04SS2NBF> 
U04S09GLN : <@U04SM6T2H> ```var delayOutput = function(message, options) {  return 60/(((options &amp;&amp; options.wpm) ? options.wpm : '60')/(message.split(' ').length));
}

var message = "I'm doing pretty well today. How are you doing today?";
console.log(delayOutput(message, {"wpm":100}))
```

U04S09GLN : err, that only gives you the delay value. but you should get the point.
U05560TFT : slack needs a way to limit # of @'s in a single message
U05560TFT : I'm at Runway, which is a coworking space in the Twitter building w/ 300 people &amp; 90 companies. Someone just @ spammed me and like 15 other people which IMHO is mucho uncool (she was asking for product feedback)
U05560TFT : We have every one's (broke that word up and didnt use the @ to be safe) limited of course, but the multiple @'s spam is annoying &amp; this isn't the first time it's happened
U04S09GLN : ```var delayOutput = function(message, options) {  return (60/(((options &amp;&amp; options.wpm) ? options.wpm : '60')/(message.split(' ').length))*1000);
}

var message = "I'm doing pretty well today. How are you doing today?";
var demo = setTimeout(function(){
  console.log(message);
}, delayOutput(message, {"wpm":120}));
```

U04S09GLN : ok, there's a better usage. variable response time for length of message, adjustable by the speed of the bot
U04S09GLN : so maybe the more professional bots respond at 150wpm
U04S09GLN : but the slower ones respond at 60.
U04SM6T2H : nice
U04SM6T2H : you are such a nerd erin
U04S09GLN : That's what I'm here for.
U04S09GLN : Perfecting the uncanny valley of text bots.
U04S09GLN : I could imagine a more involved or related function that also dictates speed between messages.
U04SM6T2H : yeah
