<@U2DNFG26B> ^ sorry forgot to tag you in the answer
thank you. For a reason unknown if my user id is in a variable, it doesn't work, but if I input the user id value myself in channel, it's working. The only thing is, I get the response the Dm with slackbot. is this what's you also have ?
Is it possible to mute a specific user in a channel?
hello guys, I have a question. I integrated our web api with the slack team channel and I am sending messages with buttons. I want that button to lead me to external url when I click it? Is that possible, I tried a lot of options but there are not working
thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U2EHWA8NM> that's not supported (yet)
need to fall back to links in text/fields

Hello Guys good morning hope all is all. i have question on fileupload event trigger
using botkit
    at Object.Botkit.botkit.receiveMessage (/home/jothiprakash/node_modules/botkit/lib/CoreBot.js:857:35)
Please advise
wouldn't you want to use content.url_private instead of file.url_private? where do you define file?
also, might get a better response in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit>
i have tried content.url_private too. i got a output as undefined
for your referecne i have attached the code snippet
try content.file.url_private ? Maybe the content is the entire event which also has a 'type' field
let try now
TypeError: Cannot read property 'url_private' of undefined
so content.file doesn't exist....I wonder what the heck content is then haha
<#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> would have a better answer for you I wager, rather than the general channel
sure i will post this question into <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> . thanks for your help have a wonderful day
hello all~
Looking for help with my use case - I already have Twilio integration setup and want to use BotKit for the conversation functionality only. In other words I don't need to connect and listen to Twilio. Is there a way I can do this, maybe using Botkit.core directly ?
<@U2F5Q8UG6> there is actually
you can route messages in and out however you want by building your own connector
DM me if you want more detalis
it is not well documented _yet_
Howdy all.. any good resources on the Events API? Couldn't find the right channel.. sorry.
<@U200UBJSJ> the <#C1XFTGV55|slapp> framework supports events
I'll check it out. I've been crafting my own from the ground up. Nice to know.
botkit will eventually too
what kind of resources do you need?
(sorry going afk)
Thanks. Botkit is wonderful. Wrote my own RTM handlers and conversation flows, before I found the gem that is Botkit.
Looking into the Events API as a way to keep resources low. Possibly re-engineer what we've built to support scale.
Just had a peek at slapp .. nice work. Looks like you need to roll your own state management, or plug into the BeepBoop ecosystem. Worth a look.
Thanks!
Hey everyone! Thanks for letting me join.  Quick questions: What is the best practice in terms of handling multiple slack groups and their data/privacy? Also how do you approach modeling the database?
<@U2EDT25NJ> check toki by <@U15SL8QHG>
<https://github.com/kevinsuh/toki>
not exactly what you're looking for, but could inspire you
<@U0HBN0L9M> thank you very much,  checking it out!
That's an interesting problem you have <@U2EDT25NJ>. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions / thoughts / ideas
awesome, very much appreciate it.  As we all know slack is amazing, but when customers are in there… kills down time after hours.
will DM you next week after I have a chance to check it out <@U15SL8QHG> :slightly_smiling_face:
Sounds great! Looking forward to it
Can botkit be used with Twilio SMS ?
I see it works with TwilioIP but my understanding is IP can not send SMS / MMS messages to phone numbers
there is a botkit-sms plugni yes
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/botkit-sms>
Nice, thanks <@U04SM6T2H> !
<@U2F5Q8UG6> Hi Matt. You can try Ottspott. Just grab a phone number and you can send&amp;receive SMS <http://ottspott.co/>
