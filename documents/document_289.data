``` then the `let` clause will be eagerly executed, even if I don't reference it anywhere. In this case the `Debug.log` did it's effect despite the fact that `fetchData` was not called. I was expecting it to be lazy.
Hello, <@U62UFEG4D> !
hey <@U2D7NUGS1>
To finish my though: That got me confused.
Thanks in advance
I have shared in this snippet my second attempt...
<@U62UFEG4D> `Random.map2`
`Random.map2 (,) (<http://Random.int|Random.int> 1 6) (<http://Random.int|Random.int> 1 6) |&gt; Random.generate (uncurry NewFace)`
<@U48AEBJQ3> it works now, thanks a lot!
is there a way with elm-package to "restore" packages that are already mentioned as dependencies in my elm-package.json?
to download all dependencies after cloning a repository for the first time
<@U604S603Y> just `elm-package install --yes` should handle that :slightly_smiling_face:
perfect! thanks <@U3SJEDR96>
I need very little interaction with leaflet for now, so ports are working ok. But I'll definitely watch the video. Thanks <@U3LT1UTPF> .
