U5Y4ERBU0 : do I need to import something?
U0LPMPL2U : Are you trying to use that package?
U5Y4ERBU0 : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Fresheyeball/elm-guards/latest>
U5Y4ERBU0 : i guess so
U0LPMPL2U : if so, you will need to install the package: `elm package install Fresheyeball/elm-guards` on the command line
U5Y4ERBU0 : oh got it working, import Guards
U5Y4ERBU0 : ty
U23SA861Y : to be fair, a whole import to remove what is like 2 keystrokes is probably not worth it
U3LUC6SNS : The bug concerns the behavior of `textarea`.  If one types fast, the cursor jumps around, messing up your edits.  This is cured by using `defaultValue` instead of `value` to present text to the eye of the user.  However, this reveals another bug, which is that the textarea does not update when it receives input programmatically.  
I the example, I use the `style-elements` package and its `textArea`.  It displays the same behavior as mentioned above for a textarea field using `defaultValue`.

U0JFXEUCT : <@U3LUC6SNS> In your example, I think you need to adjust usage of `keyed` to match the comment at the end of this chain: <https://github.com/elm-lang/html/issues/105>
U0JFXEUCT : Given in the thread```
Keyed.node "div"
        []
        [ ( toString counter
          , input
                [ type_ "text"
                , onInput HandleInput
                , defaultValue message
                ]
                []
          )
        ]
```

In your code:

```
 Keyed.node "textarea"
        [ HA.id "editPane3"
        , HA.defaultValue model.current_document.content
        , HE.onInput InputContent
        ]
        [] 
```

You need the text area to be within the keyed node.

U2M73CM5F : hello everyone, I hope you're all great. I would like to ask a general question about Elm ; I'm about to start learning and I'd like to know if I am doing the right choice (even though, considering how everyone trying Elm is in love with it, it must be the right choice at some point anyway :wink: ). So I have 2 questions, my first one is about learning Elm, and the other one is about what you can do once you are able to use it : first, what previous knowledge do you need to learn Elm ? I have an intermediate level in JS, HTML and CSS, and I'm going back to work after a year off so I might be a bit rusty. And then, once you are able to use Elm, what more do you need to learn, to be independant to build a web app? (When I say independant, I mean, by your own, you can build your app, back and front, of course you don't know everything and maybe you'll struggle and ask help on the way but you have the basic knowledge to do it, and to get the knowledge you miss on your way. Versus : some parts are totally obscure to you.) Is it like, what you will learn on your Elm way will teach you what you need to know ? Or do you need to add some back-end and database deep knowledge ?  Well, sorry for the long message and thank you very much for your answers :slightly_smiling_face:
U4JT89FGB : Unfortunately at this time you can't use Elm on the backend, so if your application requires centralized data storage or business logic of some sort, you'll still need to handle that separately.
U2M73CM5F : zgohr, and I've read some things about Elm using Node or compiling to Node or something with Node… it doesn't help?
U4JT89FGB : I haven't looked into it so I'm not sure how viable it would be
U2M73CM5F : ok - and so, in other words, what can you exactly do with elm ?
U4JT89FGB : Build the front-end of web applications
U2M73CM5F : ok, thank you
U4JT89FGB : Very generally, it replaces the use of javascript and html
U2M73CM5F : and what about the previous knowledge that you need to start ?
U2M73CM5F : ok, I see
U0D4VR7BP : <@U2M73CM5F>as for the first question, about previous knowledge... knowing **some** programming language helps, although it's probably not necessary :slightly_smiling_face: today I've heard my friends from one startup say that when they hire somebody to work on their Elm codebase, in two to three weeks he is fully "caught up".

U2M73CM5F : should I consider it a sort of "functional react ?"
U0D4VR7BP : <@U2M73CM5F> Elm architecture maps very closely to React+Redux
U0D4VR7BP : React = Elm's viewRedux = Elm's update+model

U2M73CM5F : ok
U2M73CM5F : this is still a bit abstract to me but I think I get the idea
U2M73CM5F : but the guy who fully caught up Elm after few weeks was basically a web dev from other languages, right ?
U0D4VR7BP : yeah
U0D4VR7BP : JS guy
U2M73CM5F : ok yes
U2M73CM5F : cause right now I'm not at that step, I'm just learning still
U2M73CM5F : as I said, like intermediate JS - html - css level, but not more except many readings that give me some hint of the thing, but nothing like a real experience or a deep knowledge
U2M73CM5F : and I'd like to become independant, so I'm wondering what's the best way to follow (or if it's still too far from me) - i don't intend to be a superstar dev, right now just understanding the whole web app process and being able to do "something" with it
U4JT89FGB : wish i could answer you better, it's pretty hard to generalize about anything. I think it comes down to what your goals are with it
U4JT89FGB : A lot of us come from a javascript background and the preference for Elm comes from the distaste for javascript
U2M73CM5F : thank you <@U4JT89FGB>, yes sure i understand that it's hard to answer like this, thank you
U2M73CM5F : oh, ok, well personally I like javascript very much basically, maybe there are some real world problems coming from it, but I didn't have to experience them yet
U2M73CM5F : ok and I have just an easy question, what resources do you recommend to learn elm? the one provided on elm's website ?
U2M73CM5F : (or maybe it's not such an easy question, i don't know)
U0D4VR7BP : <@U2M73CM5F> personally I'd try to do some programming exercises in it (on Exercism or Project Euler or something similar), but there are tutorials: <https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/> or <https://guide.elm-lang.org/> ... and I'm sure there are others :slightly_smiling_face:
U4JT89FGB : See the resources at the bottom of this blog post -&gt; <https://medium.com/@birowsky/web-is-ready-for-you-on-line-elm-d3aa14dbf95>
U2M73CM5F : <@U0D4VR7BP> <@U4JT89FGB> thank you very much
U3LUC6SNS : Thanks very much!  I'm looking into this now.
U17MNKY3H : <@U2M73CM5F> I think the job pool will be much smaller for Elm unfortunately.
U17MNKY3H : (Not sure if that's an important factor for you.)
U2M73CM5F : <@U17MNKY3H>, you're right. I don't really intend to work full time in a company, but I'd like to be able to work as a freelancer. Well I guess the problem is the sae
U2M73CM5F : same
U17MNKY3H : I'd say it's worse for freelance work.
U2M73CM5F : haha good
U17MNKY3H : With permanent positions you can seek out companies that use Elm.
U2M73CM5F : yes you're right
U2M73CM5F : definitely right
U17MNKY3H : And those that do will often advertise it since it's a tech that's easy to fall in love (or at least a slight infatuation) with  :wink: - so it makes them attractive workplaces.
U2M73CM5F : ok yes
U17MNKY3H : Hope that's more helpfull than preachy. :sweat_smile: :slightly_smiling_face:
U2M73CM5F : <@U17MNKY3H>, yes, sure! :wink:
U2M73CM5F : thank you
U4JT89FGB : I have an interesting bug - basically a page with a form and submit (login) that upon success redirects to another page with another form. On the new form, the first two inputs contain the values that were in the first form. Elm's model is correct, those old form values aren't there.. The virtual dom seems to re-use the first page's inputs.
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U4JT89FGB> Try using `Html.Keyed` and see if the problem goes away.
U4JT89FGB : Not interesting - i guess common in virtual dom scenarios. was curious how to handle with elm
U48AEBJQ3 : Yes, the virtual dom has to guess a bit to make things faster, it doesn't always get it how we want it, so we need to give some extra information.
U17MNKY3H : <@U4JT89FGB> how's your view code for the second page/screen look like?
U4JT89FGB : ah, using a keyed node works. thanks <@U48AEBJQ3>
U2M73CM5F : thank you for the kind answers everyone and have a nice evening!
U5W6LPGTE : I'm having trouble understanding "multiple types" (I'm sure that's not the correct term).  E.g. "Program Never Model Msg", or "Cmd Msg", or "Http.Request value", or "Result Error value".  Could someone point me to an explanation of these "compound types"?
U5VD8S0HZ : How would I do math operations on values greater than 2,147,483,647? Is there something in the core library that can handle this?
U57KYFW67 : <@U5VD8S0HZ> Where did you get that number, by the way?
U57KYFW67 : <@U5VD8S0HZ> In general, any language that compiles to Javascript will have an obnoxious time dealing with large integers, since Javascript doesn't have a native integer type. (Maybe things have changed since I last looked, though, due to webasm? I'm not sure)
U23SA861Y : <@U5W6LPGTE> these types are called Union Types or Algebraic Data Types
U23SA861Y : depending on the community you're in
U5VD8S0HZ : <@U57KYFW67> in my elm-repl:```
&gt; 2147483647
2147483647 : number
&gt; 2147483648
-2147483648 : number
```

U5W6LPGTE : <@U23SA861Y> There's nothing that looks like that at: <https://guide.elm-lang.org/types/union_types.html>…
U57KYFW67 : <@U23SA861Y> <@U5W6LPGTE> I don't think those are union/algebraic types, though. At least the aspect <@U5W6LPGTE> seems to be asking about
U57KYFW67 : Those are all parametrized types
U23SA861Y : the parameterization in part of the algebra of algebraic data types
U57KYFW67 : `Cmd Msg` means a command which, when it returns a response, has the "shape" of a `Msg`
U5W6LPGTE : <@U57KYFW67> For example, where can I find the "definition" of "Program Never Model Msg"?
U57KYFW67 : You can kind of ignore the parameters when working in your code. For instance, just think of `Cmd Msg` as just.... a command.
U23SA861Y : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Platform>
U57KYFW67 : <@U5W6LPGTE> <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Platform#Program> &lt;-- this has the declaration. The definition is not available, though, since it is a primitive in the langauge
