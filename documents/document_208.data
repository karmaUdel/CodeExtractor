U2HAXK4E4 : Specifically within the Android Facebook Messenger app.
U2HAXK4E4 : I'm getting expected behavior from the browser for <http://facebook.com|facebook.com> and <http://messenger.com|messenger.com>, but within the Android Messenger app, every bot I try and use seems to be slow to load or gives some sort of strange behavior. Earlier I was getting a POST loop from the Android Messenger app for my bot, where I would select a quick reply, and it would keep sending me the wrong quick reply on a loop ever minute until I closed the Android Facebook Messenger app.
U2HCUAZ8V : Anyone there, who can help me?
U2HCUAZ8V : Hi Guys, i just started coding a custom slackbot. Actually i don´t get an response from my boot using the following python line: AT_BOT = "&lt;@" + BOT_ID + "&gt;"
U2HFEUWH4 : anyone know what the reasoning is behind not including `original_message` for interactive button actions on ephemeral messages? seems silly to me and makes it difficult to do multiple updates to the message
U0HUTFBHS : <@U2HCUAZ8V> That's a bit too out of context to troubleshoot- also there is <#C0J3CL5V1|language-python>.
U2HCUAZ8V : <@U0HUTFBHS> thank you :slightly_smiling_face:
U2HHWP7V4 : gasp
U2HHWP7V4 : trying to work with the rtmbot in python
U2HHWP7V4 : not so easy :slightly_smiling_face:
U2BU0A9A5 : hi all!I have an issue with RTM:

```notice: RTM close event 1006
error: Abnormal websocket close event, attempting to reconnect```

U0H1Y7M1S : does anyone know of a bot that passively picks up any URLs shared in rooms and puts them as a digest in another room? use case is i want to see what news is shared in our company's slack so i can put them in our twitter buffer :slightly_smiling_face:

A new email privacy option for your team*
Slack now allows team admins to hide email addresses from user profiles. Everyone will still need an email address to sign up, but with this setting, their email won't be visible to other team members.

We've hidden email addresses for your team, but if you'd like to make them visible again, visit **Team settings* &gt; *Email Display**.
```

Great new option from Slack team. They did listen to the feedback re abuse and spamming in large communities. :clap: 

Are emails hidden now in this community <@U04SM6T2H> ?

U2D112EP6 : How does one get a bot user token from the OAuth Flow? I only seem to get one for the active user.
I have a Bot associated with the Slack App but that doesn't seem to have any influence.

U2CCKNCLR : Hi there. The EVENT-API does not work for me. Altough my url checks are correct, my app seems not be able to receive any events. I have to listen to POST, right?Scopes for my app is: X-OAuth-Scopes: identify,read,post,client,apps

U0HBN0L9M : have you configured your app to send some evens to your server ?
U2CCKNCLR : <@U0HBN0L9M> I configured a route (Express Framework) to answer to POST-Request, the same route answers Slack request for url-confirmation (and resends the challenge token successfully).P.S.: I use BOTKIT, but as this library does not interfere with my route, I suppose this should not be a problem, is it?

U0HBN0L9M : on your server, that seems ok
U0HBN0L9M : but I meant
U0HBN0L9M : have you configured in <http://api.slack.com/apps|api.slack.com/apps>
U0HBN0L9M : your app to send events
U2CCKNCLR : <@U0HBN0L9M> Yes I did and I tested it: Slack was able to confirm that my server is reachable (confirmation of the url of my server, the route was able to resend the challenge token).
