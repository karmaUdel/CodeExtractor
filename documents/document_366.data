U5D4VHEN7 : Do what is fun and engaging though. I think that is far more important than anything when you first start out. As long as you keep exploring, you'll come across all of the stuff you "should" know.
U635238TG : that's basically been my whole philosophy right now. it's why i jumped straight into a linux command line and vim too. next stop git. they all fascinate me and i'm able to throw massive hours into this right now because i find it fun and interesting and it feels like the right way.
U153UK3FA : Lots of Elm documentation expects you to have a certain amount of familiarity with HTML and CSS so you should run through a few tutorials on those first
U5D4VHEN7 : That is super awesome to hear! You are for sure on the right path. I didn't touch Linux/the command line/Git until well into my first year of programming.
U5D4VHEN7 : Yeah, I do agree with <@U153UK3FA>. Understanding HTML/CSS is like understanding the basic material that the web is made of, which is arguably very important. However, keep the fun factory priority #1, and don't let any specific topic burn you out.
U635238TG : got it. i will jump on those html/css tutorials. but i'm still doing some elm stuff at the same time. you can't stop me jessta! lol, jk
U5D4VHEN7 : This was my intro to HTML/CSS, and I highly recommend it <https://dash.generalassemb.ly/>. Don't have any experience with the one you linked prior, but it definitely looks decent at a glance.
U5D4VHEN7 : It's very compartmentalized too, so easy to do in chunks
U635238TG : will do. i appreciate it. i'm almost sad i'm doing a 10 day meditation retreat starting wed. But i'm going to have some uber focus when I get back to this.
U5D4VHEN7 : Hahaha, I feel you there. Haven't done a meditation retreat, but have had a lot of experiences with other things taking up my time when I'm just super stoked to program/learn some new language.
U3LUC6SNS : I am installing my app on another machine.  It uses webpack.  Have been following the directions at <https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en-v01/04-starting/06-webpack-4.html>, but when I do `yarn start`, I get this message: ```
 Error: Cannot find module '/Users/carlson/Documents/dev/koko_client/api.js'
```

U3LUC6SNS : I've obviously missed something, but don't see what it is
U3LUC6SNS : Indeed there is no `api.js`, but I don't know what to do to create it.
U5D4VHEN7 : Do you have this app on github?
U3LUC6SNS : <@U5D4VHEN7> Yes, here it is: <https://github.com/jxxcarlson/koko_elm_client>
U5D4VHEN7 : Taking a look :eyes:
U3LUC6SNS : :slightly_smiling_face:
U62PV9CPN : Hi folks, I was wondering what the leading dot notation was about in rtfeldman's `elm-validate` package was?
The example given:
```
validateModel : Model -&gt; List (Field, String)
validateModel =
    Validate.all
        [ .name  &gt;&gt; ifBlank (Name, "Please enter a name.")
        , .email &gt;&gt; ifBlank (Email, "Please enter an email address.")
        , .age   &gt;&gt; ifNotInt (Age, "Age must be a whole number.")
        ]
```

I feel like that means to implicitly access members of the Model record without needing specify it as an actual argument, but the type of something like `.name` is kinda funny:

 `{ a | name : String } -&gt; String`

U62PV9CPN : I'm trying to pass `.name` into a function of my own, and I thought it would be a `String` but I think this is saying it's a function of some kind?
U62U9DUN6 : I'm wondering if there's a simpler way to get a random int than by using the core random module?
U3LUC6SNS : <@U62PV9CPN> `foo.bar` and `.bar foo` are equivalent
U5D4VHEN7 : <@U3LUC6SNS> from a bit of poking around, it looks like there are some bits missing from this application? It seems to want to call `api.js`, which I think might be `server.js`, and it looks like it also is trying to talk to a Phoenix Websocket channel. I can get you part of the way there: just running `./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server` will at least get the frontend to run
U62PV9CPN : <@U3LUC6SNS> What is a `subject` and `error` in the context of this source? Are they built into elm?
<https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-validate/blob/1.1.3/src/Validate.elm>

U62PV9CPN : oh wait, are those args for the Validator type? (args is probably the wrong word…)
U62PV9CPN : so they're kinda arbitrary?
U3LUC6SNS : <@U5D4VHEN7> Thanks, I tried that and got further than before.  The first error was ```
ERROR in ./src/index.html
Module parse failed: /Users/carlson/Documents/dev/koko_client/src/index.html Unexpected token (1:0)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type.
```
which seems a bit odd.  Any idea of why that is happenning?

I'm rebuilding the app and my development environment on my wife's computer from a working repo .. my computer no longer recognizes the keyboard and we are far from civilization for a week. :rage:

U3LUC6SNS : Yes, the app talks to a Phoenix server using both http and websockets.
