U42B3H3NV : So far I've only been able to figure out how to update a message using BotKit's bot.replyInteractive
U3ES7AM6X : I just published a story about machine agents and deep learning aka "artificial intelligence" <https://medium.com/dronzebot/our-fears-about-machine-intelligence-make-is-less-prepared-to-face-our-future-35549863fa74#.ujao1wah1>

U4157USUU : Hi All, I have a python slackclient module question
U4157USUU : relates to this SO question: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34044690/bot-postmessage-missing-icon-and-name>
U4157USUU : basically my 'hello world' python code.. will show up fine.. as 'bot' with no user icon.. but will not show up as the '@security-bot' user with icon that I set up under 'Custom Integrations' --&gt; 'Bots'
U4157USUU : I've tried setting the 'as_user' parameter to true.. but then the message doesn't show up at all

U4157USUU : oh.. silly me.. looking at the return value.. I see
U4157USUU : ```{'ok': False, 'error': 'not_in_channel'}

U4157USUU : Looks like bots cannot join channels, so what do folks normally do.. create a new channel?  DMs?
U4157USUU : oh.. right.. slack is invite based ... okay.. I'll stop babbling now... have a good night all
U47SAG9A9 : hey team I have a bot user approved and would like to get the messages posted to a channel. how do i do it through a RTM ?  or should i go for events api ? i have a bot token approved.  but do i need to have a specific oauth token generated ?

U47SAG9A9 : i m using slackclient python SDK
U4157USUU : <@U47SAG9A9> This is a good page for starting out: <https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html>
U3UD6RY59 : Hey all, RadBots just launched PersonaDB (historical key/value store for state in your bots) <https://radbots.com/products/personas>

U3236DR4Z : Hi All!,  does slack allow to user to give review  slack app?
U0GT29N3A : <@U3236DR4Z> It's on their long-term roadmap: <https://trello.com/c/Xwdpj2fX/4-app-ratings-and-reviews>
U3VCCQLM9 : <@U0GT29N3A> you don't like Juno's Bot? :smile:
U0GT29N3A : <@U3VCCQLM9> This is a public channel with 4000+ humans, bots are now welcome here.
U3VCCQLM9 : but i like bots :disappointed:
U3VCCQLM9 : although i'm partial since i have my own :smile:
U0KECURAT : bots shouldn't be in the general channel, pretty sure it's in the guidelines for this team as well :slightly_smiling_face:
U0GT29N3A : Just imagine the chaos that would ensure if every 4000+ people added their own bot here. :boom:
U3VCCQLM9 : point taken
U3VCCQLM9 : haha
U3VCCQLM9 : is any user allowed to add their own bot? i thought creating tokens is restricted to the admins/owner
U3236DR4Z : Okay,  Thx <@U0GT29N3A>
U44KVKXLL : Hi team, i am trying to use <http://socket.io|socket.io> on top of BotKit, to allow bot chat from our website
U44KVKXLL : can someone please help me with the right steps i can follow.
U44KVKXLL : i mean correct approach, to make this integration
U3236DR4Z : Hi All!,video file uploading through file.upload using python is not able to play. can anyone help ?
U0V93GE5R : <@U42BF4B89> please disable that ^
U48HC7EUU : Could someone help me with upgrading my hubot slack adapter?  I'm going from `1.5.2` to `4.3.1`
U48HC7EUU : I created a new integration as requested, but I'm not able to get my bot to respond to commands after upgrading
U0HRQBPE1 : Hey All - I'm putting together a blog post about lessons learned getting to 100 paid customers for our Slack App - <http://Tettra.co|Tettra.co>. Have a few so far and thought it'd be good to ask the community here if you have any specific questions about the journey.
U0HRQBPE1 : Turning this proactivity into a thread
U0V93GE5R : Im just commenting so I can keep an eye here :smile:
U0V93GE5R : Would love to read about identifying leads, converting teams and retaining them.
U0HRQBPE1 : <@U0V93GE5R> Good questions. Specifically are you talking about the tools we use for our sales funnel or how we get the leads in the first place?
U1DDKQPGB : We have paying customers too for <http://metacert.com|metacert.com> but I'd to hear your answers to the following:
1. Did you onboard via the bot or email?
2. Did you do free trial or freemium?
3. When it came to payment, how did you communicate? Via email or bot?

Basically I'd like to hear how you did onboarding and then got them to pay.

And, well done :slightly_smiling_face:

U04S3JCH2 : Will read this post for sure!
U04S3JCH2 : If you could speak to some of the economics of determining your pricing model, that would be interesting to me :thumbsup:
U0V93GE5R : both really!
U0HRQBPE1 : <@U1DDKQPGB> Can answer all those. <@U04S3JCH2> Will cover those too.
U0HRQBPE1 : I think this might end up being more than one post :slightly_smiling_face:
U322K0W57 : interested as well
U322K0W57 : thanks Andy
U04S3JCH2 : I think it's going to be a great post. This is uncharted territory you're talking! Would love to read your story about the lead up to launching paid accounts and some reflection on what worked/what didn't would be awesome. :slightly_smiling_face: Can't wait.
U48K69M1Q : Congratz on the awesome progress Andy! Some questions I'd love to hear your thoughts on: 
1. What are you doing to encourage people at the end of their trial to convert
2. Reasons for having trail vs free tier
3. Challenges with onboarding that you are tackling to educate users

U42BF4B89 : peterswimm: already did… Sorry for the inconvenience..
U0KH7478W : Well done guys :clap:We at MailClark passed the :100: paid customers threshold in December, so the questions asked in this thread really resonate with me.

My specific question about your journey would be about your pricing: Is $5/u/m version 1 of your pricing? Have you considered charging per team, or per page? $5/u/m is pretty close to Slack's $6.67/u/m, am I the first one to make this comment :wink: ?

U46DFLBFW : Hi everyone, I just started a personal challenge to build a very simple bot per week, open source all the code and love to get your feedback : I'll try to post one article on medium per week explaining why here :<https://medium.com/the-obaw-project>
You'll find the tutorial to run the bot here : <https://github.com/plieb/OBAW>

If you have any bot idea do not hesitate to ping me :slightly_smiling_face:

U3236DR4Z : Hi All, can anyone help me  how to install my slack app to multiple team using slack button from my website?
U49FD8KC6 : Hi All, how I get botkit studio token?
U48TGLLUV : hi guys
U48TGLLUV : i want to create _django slackbot_ any one help please
U3236DR4Z : <@U48TGLLUV> <http://django-slack.readthedocs.io/>
U24AT9ZN1 : If you're a Product Manager using #Slack, then I have a gem for you! I've composed a list of 100+ Slack apps and integrations for most of the managers' tasks. Please leave your comments below with Slack apps and integrations you're a fan of! :point_down:
<https://medium.com/p/100-slack-apps-and-integrations-for-a-product-manager-52f44ec2d8f4>

U1DDKQPGB : For security and user monitoring and analytics <http://MetaCert.com|MetaCert.com> charges $1.5 per user per month. We haven't tested other pricing yet so don't know if it's the best option for our particular use case.
U2QGELSTS : :slackapi: *Slack Event Adapters for Node and Python* :slackapi:
Today we're launching two new tools that make building on the Events API simpler:
*  [Slack Event Adapter for Node](<https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-events-api>)
*  [Slack Event Adapter for Python](<https://github.com/slackapi/python-slack-events-api>)

We're happy to add to our existing SDKs to bring developers the tools they need to get productive on the Slack Platform faster and easier. Check out this tutorial on our blog: <https://medium.com/@SlackAPI/enhancing-slacks-events-api-7535827829ab>

U322K0W57 : This is a report that everyone needs to read. Its done by McKinsey: The age of analytics: Competing in a data-driven world
U322K0W57 : you can find it here: <http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/the-age-of-analytics-competing-in-a-data-driven-world>
U322K0W57 : Somebody seems to have extracted a few interesting things from there: <https://medium.com/@thoszymkowiak/120-machine-learning-business-ideas-from-the-new-mckinsey-report-b81b239f336#.6vndph3l0>
U43E2J0FM : Can I have a process trigger a custom response to a specific user?workflow:
```
user messages bot with "end_of_day foobar"
botkit hears "end_of_day" and passes userid, foobar, and other metadata to some script
some backend process is triggered
when backend process is complete, it's last action is to notify botkit of a userid, and custom message
botkit delivers custom message to user
```

U3QQKC2SW : Yeah, <@U43E2J0FM> you should be able. After the backend process is completed, you can open a channel first with bot.api.im.open, passing the userID, and then you can do bot.startConversation or bot.say I think, passing the channelId you received from bot.api.im.open
U43E2J0FM : So, how would I do this? It's easy to make a method have userID and customMessage as inputs, but is there an API that I can use to communicate with the current botkit instance?
U3Q3N3VRC : Can we change the name of the bot in an app later ?
U272P5K71 : yes, but it has weird side effects
U3Q3N3VRC : oh ok
U272P5K71 : (trying to dig up a post I saw about this)
U3Q3N3VRC : ok thanks
U272P5K71 : if I recall correctly, it will update on new teams but not old teams, and it does something weird if you change scopes and a user has to re-auth
U3Q3N3VRC : Thats strange
