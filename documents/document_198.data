Any suggestions? Feel like I'm just being a derp
You've probably heard Slack rolled message menus this week. It will have a solid impact on workflow improvements within Slack. So we've quickly updated Standuply bot to make daily standup meetings *easier* using message menus in Slack :sunglasses: . <https://medium.com/standuply/how-message-menus-in-slack-improve-daily-standups-25e5750beb63>
Hi there! One quick question… How do I get server details like Host, Port etc.. of a server where my bot code is running? I want to get these details when user types some command say.. debug
Is there a channel related to designing chatbot conversations? E.g. discussing certain conversational principles etc.
Hi all - I know this is a botkit team, and I have and continue to use botkit and generally like it. That being said, I was hoping to get an honest appraisal about botkit vs slapp. Has anyone used both?
Might be worth asking for opinions in the <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> and <#C1XFTGV55|slapp> channels, respectively
Hey, is anyone online who can help me troubleshoot a bot I'm trying to set up? This is my first time with botkit studio. I've got something set up with glitch, and the bot is showing up as online in my Slack app, but it doesn't respond when I type "hello."
I'm not really online, but check your env file in glitch has all the correct tokens, and your events subscriptions and various urls on the slack side are correct. The starter kit will poot a connected message once everything is correct. 
Now that you can set the status bot for slack to be always online the online button doesn't really mean anything anymore. 
We also have <#C4MJKM145|botkit_studio> if you need more help
Thanks, Peter. I just figured it out. There were steps in configuring the bot inside Slack that I missed. It's working now.
Is there any way to get an email address of the Slack user when they use our '/command'?
Is there any way to get an email address of the Slack users when they use our '/command'?
If you have requested the right oauth scopes, you can use the slack API to request that info
however I believe the terms of use on those email addresses is very strict
<https://api.slack.com/methods/users.info>
Whomever is behind <@U4S2TQMED> harvesting email addresses from GitHub to then send unsolicited marketing emails is spam and against the law, per my email reply to you just now I've reported your company to the FCC and reported your domain the internet spam blacklists
And of course this is against the terms of this community, so we will be removing that account from this slack. 
It will help us design a new product.
And whilst I'm in a grumpy mood, <@U50904YF7> what does filling out a financial survey have anything to do with the prupose of this Slack instance, nothing is my answer, so why do you think it acceptable practice to spam our developer community with this garbage?
hi <@U0K4TM8N8>: my apologies if you felt this as a spam. we are developing chat bots to help address our perceived void in online lending space and wanted to get feedback from fellow devs
in the future, lets post such things in <#C0JQ4TX7Z|announcements> guys

Hi, I am new to the RTM api (websockets) of Slack. I saw that when a client sends a new message to a channel, the server replies with an ack. However, when the server pushes the message event to the clients (to inform that a new message was posted), the clients are not expected to send an ack. Isn't there a possibility that the clients get out of sync? e.g. in a case of a temporary network failure.
I am attempting to simulate (and fix) performance/scaling issues that occur with an app, when there are thousands of teams.

<@U50V26V7W> I've used this instead of on('end': <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/readme.md#convoontimeout>
Not sure if you _can't_ do it your way, but this has worked for me
<@U4T67EY1X>  i tried that too, but i get convo.onTimeout is unknown..
TypeError: convo.onTimeout is not a function
Hey do you guys know if it's possible to have a slider in FB messenger?
Like the contrast one or volume
<https://pe-images.s3.amazonaws.com/photo-editing/brightness-contrast/contrast-100.gif>
Maybe using the web view?
is it possible to export the howdy checkin notes? i'd like people to put jira ticket numbers in and then export them automatically by a bash script
Not programmatically.  You could copy paste them from the dashboard notes page and cleanly post them in a doc. So maybe you could do some sort of selenium script to scrape that?
Either way, data export is a feature we are thinking about for a future update.
thanks
hi,How to make a bot user get the notifications of a channel?
anabel: What do you mean by notifications?
When a user writes to respond you need to put your mail, how can I respond faster and without having the mail to whom I will write?
I'm assuming your talking about slack?
yes
You can get the users email using the controller.storage method one moment
