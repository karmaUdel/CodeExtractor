U19J7PF7T : <@U04S0AG48>:  thanks!
U0HUTFBHS : I test my service in isolation.
U1F77D0NS : <@U0HUTFBHS>: do you mean to setup a second app?
U0HUTFBHS : Well, a slash command sends a request to a service- so I test that service code with a fixture of what I expect from slack.
U1F77D0NS : I see.. what I understand is that there's a single URL to post to, which means that I can't switch from production to a private fixture (like local tunnel) without breaking production
U0HUTFBHS : Oh I see what you're saying.  Yes, that's true.
U0HUTFBHS : Or add a secondary command like /command-beta
U0YQS1FAR : Yeah we run separate apps/slash commands for each env
U0HUTFBHS : But my isolated testing of the service ensures a bit that I'm going to get what I expect out of it.
U1F77D0NS : got it that helps, thanks guys
U19J7PF7T : Hey guys is this valid? ```bot.api.chat.postMessage({            "attachments": [
                {
                    "fallback": "Fallback test",
                    "color": "#36a64f",
                    "pretext": "Lorem ipsum dolor set amet",
                    "text": "Loerem *ispum* dolor ser anet",
                    "mrkdwn_in": ["text", "pretext"]
                }
            ],
            "channel": message.channel.id
        });```

U16KJV0LS : Hey guys, the slack bot I made spawns a thread for every team to passively listen, does anyone have a better solution to handle many users? ( BTW programmed in Python)
U18HVKW5P : are user id's unique per team or are they guaranteed unique across the entire slack platform ?
U16KJV0LS : Hmm I always wondered about that, but I think team ID are unique across the platform however the user ID may not be unique
U0YQS1FAR : I don't see how user id's could not be unique
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0YQS1FAR>: they currently are, but are not guaranteed to be in the future
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U18HVKW5P>: :point_up:
U15SL8QHG : why wouldn't they stay uniuqe into the future?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U15SL8QHG>: they might decide to avoid the overhead of creating globally-unique IDs for everything and start sharding some of the IDs per team
U0HBN0L9M : <@U16KJV0LS>: check <#C0J3CL5V1> I suggest
U0HBN0L9M : librairies probably let you listen to MANY teams per process
U0D7LHNTX : The combination of user_id and team_id is always guaranteed to be unique. We're just covering our butts.
U11FSNKL0 : in botkit storage is atm saving each user with id=userId... we will need to change it to teamId+userId then...
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0D7LHNTX>: the question was about the `user_id` being globally unique by itself
U0D7LHNTX : Right. :thumbsup: My claim was a positive one about what we _do_ guarantee to be globally unique.
U0CS6NSF5 : yes, if you didn't guaranteed that it would be a mess :smile:
U19J7PF7T : Hi everyone
U19J7PF7T : i've been strugling with this subject, is there anyway that i can collect reaxctions made by users in a general channel
U19J7PF7T : ?
U19J7PF7T : to collect ansewers like yes or no?
U11FSNKL0 : <@U19J7PF7T>: if the bot is in the channel you will receive the events
U19J7PF7T : <@U11FSNKL0>: what kind of event?
U0HBN0L9M : reaction_added
U0HBN0L9M : it's a type of message event
U11FSNKL0 : for ex <https://api.slack.com/events/reaction_added>
U19J7PF7T : so i can do a thing like: ```bot.on('reaction_added')...```
U11FSNKL0 : I think is connector.on('', func....)
U11FSNKL0 : or controller.on
U19J7PF7T : controller yes im sory
U19J7PF7T : Thanks!
U1FHC16R0 : does anyone know if you could fwd messages from Live Chat (<http://livechatinc.com|livechatinc.com>) to slack?
U0V93GE5R : looks like you could using their api: <https://developers.livechatinc.com/>
U1F77D0NS : I noticed some popular bots only use single slash command with multiple params, vs multiple slash command. What do you guys think about pros and cons? I think single slash command might be more discoverable, such as /app-name help to get help for an app. But it's longer to type.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U1F77D0NS>: that's what the autocomplete is there for :slightly_smiling_face:
U0HUTFBHS : Make it easy for users and you shall succeed.
