U6EN2E1LG : what can I do in my original code to continously go through my program and not have to reset the list all over again each time I run it through?
U5VGKQ2SY : Where is 'the list'? What line number? When does it 'reset'? There are a couple of people who have already suggested that the question is unclear and that the 150 lines of code sort of distract from the core issue.
U5VGKQ2SY : And really, b/c this:```
else: 
    while ret not in ('r', 'x'):
      ret = input("Press R to return or X to exit")
```
is all over the place, I would consider trying this approach
```
get user_input.
while user_input not in valid_results, print error, ask for input again.
only when input in valid_results, continue through to conditional checks (`if user_input == 'a'...`)
```

U6EN2E1LG : It's in line 24 or 25 
U6EN2E1LG : Under the books (selection) function
U6EN2E1LG : Oh I understand now
U5VGKQ2SY : lines 31 and 32 are resetting the lists. The list of books and costs gets dropped down to original
U5VGKQ2SY : lists when that function is called.
U5VGKQ2SY : that call happens in lines 24/25
U6EN2E1LG : Right and I'm trying to figure out how to fix that problem
U5VGKQ2SY : change last line to```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
Move menu() in line 3 to line 2.
Break off the menu part into its own function where it outputs menu options text.
Look into how to pass lists to functions, as you are doing with `selection`

U6EN2E1LG : Name? 
U6EN2E1LG : I dont have that anywhere
U5VGKQ2SY : Right now lines 1 - 3 don't really do anything. Your program runs b/c you call menu() at the end. Instead, call main(), which in turn calls menu()
U5VGKQ2SY : Also, try this <@U6EN2E1LG>
U6FG5E81J : name is a built-in that is defined by the python interpreter (I'm jumping in late, but I think that's what you had asked)
U5VGKQ2SY : :point_up:
U6EN2E1LG : What does name do? 
U5VGKQ2SY : this
U5VGKQ2SY : It's an ugly thing that we have to accept lol
U6EN2E1LG : And that's it? That's a little vague
U6EN2E1LG : I use main to call functions menu and register 
U1BP42MRS : <@U6EN2E1LG> Here is the python doc on it: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html>
U1BP42MRS : And a little more info from SO: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/419185/1584762>
U5VGKQ2SY : lines 1 - 3?```
def main():
  
  menu()
```

U6EN2E1LG : Well I just sent you the relevant code for the problem
U6EN2E1LG : I was having
U5VGKQ2SY : lines 145 and 148 (and I'm sure others in the code you didn't post) call main(). Are you also calling main() at the bottom near/next to menu()? No, right? Otherwise you'd get dup menu().
U5VGKQ2SY : so try `if __name__ ....` to call `main()`.and use `main()` to start you off and maintain control of flow/logic, and when to quit.

U6EN2E1LG : Ok I'll try that
U5VGKQ2SY : <@U6EN2E1LG> This is just an example of how I've done this in the past <https://github.com/khdc-me/PracticePython_org/blob/master/Exercise032.py>NOTE: There are a lot of things that I would change if I had to redo this game, but it can serve as a basic guide for what you are trying to do. Again, don't follow this outright, but use it for ideas.

U6EN2E1LG : so youre saying get rid of the main()‘s and just slap a if __name__ ==  “__main__” on the bottom?
U5VGKQ2SY : no. scroll up to 11:30am. and read my reply to your previous msg
