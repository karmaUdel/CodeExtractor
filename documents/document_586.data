U6B7NBTLZ : How to update an element of a list?
U6B7NBTLZ : i mean
U6B7NBTLZ : i have a list of tasks
U6B7NBTLZ : i update a task
U6B7NBTLZ : it makes the changes
U6B7NBTLZ : but on the ui
U6B7NBTLZ : it apears after reloading the page
U4F64AKQV : <@U6B7NBTLZ> What do you mean you update the task?
U4F64AKQV : A code snippet would be helpful here.
U2XDA6CDQ : Hello, I stumbled upon a strange error while trying to run tests with `elm-test (4.1.1 &lt;= v &lt; 5.0.0)`:
```It looks like you're running elm-test from within your tests directory.

Please run elm-test from your project's root directory, where its elm-package.json lives!```

Problem is, that's exactly what I'm doing... My project's directory layout looks like this:

```
my-project/
     |_ elm/tests
             |_ Main.elm
             |_ Tests.elm
     |_ elm-package.json
```

And I'm trying to run tests with: 

```cd my-project
elm test elm/tests/Main.elm```

Did anybody ever encounter this?

U3SJEDR96 : is there an `elm-package.json` within `elm/tests`?
U2XDA6CDQ : there isn't right now. I tried running `elm test init` to create one, but it didn't make a difference
U2XDA6CDQ : I'll try again though
U3SJEDR96 : yeah, `elm-test init` assumes a certain project structure. You can use <https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-test-runner/blob/master/templates/tests/elm-package.json> as a template, though you'll need to add the path to your regular elm files to the `source-directories`
U3SJEDR96 : after that, you can run `elm-test --add-dependencies elm/tests/elm-package.json` to sync other dependencies
U3SJEDR96 : with a little luck, that should get you going
U2XDA6CDQ : <@U3SJEDR96> I just realised that I had not properly setup the `source-directories`, it now indeed goes past that step :slightly_smiling_face:
U2XDA6CDQ : ...and now fails with the following error: ```Error: Your .elm/packages/ directory may be corrupted. I was led to believe thatgdotdesign/elm-ui existed, but I could not find anything when I went to look up
the published versions of this package.```
I already tried deleting all `elm` folders I could think of (`elm-stuff`, `tests/elm-stuff`, `~/.elm`) but I still get this. in order to install `gdotdesign/elm-ui`, I had to rely on `elm-github-install`, not sure if/how that's related. any clue?

U2XDA6CDQ : ah I think it is somehow related to <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-package/issues/253> will check my versions
U3SJEDR96 : Possibly, thoughI think it's more `elm-install` is messing things up, since `elm-test` runs `elm-package install`. I think <@U0EUHKVGB> came up with a way to get it working, though I don't remember exactly what it was. Also, <@U0K7EBT3J> was facing the same issue, maybe they know.
U2XDA6CDQ : thanks a lot again!
U6B7NBTLZ : <@U4F64AKQV>
U6B7NBTLZ : i need a updateTasks function
U153UK3FA : <@U6B7NBTLZ> so, model.tasks is a list of tasks?
U6B7NBTLZ : Yes
U153UK3FA : <@U6B7NBTLZ> values in Elm are immutable, they can't be changed, you can only create new values. So to update a task in that list you create a new list with the updated task in place of the old task.
U6B7NBTLZ : undestood
