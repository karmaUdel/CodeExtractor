print("\n".join(news))```
But it doesn't print anything. I tried _almost_ everything :disappointed:
that xpath looks invalid
Sure? Python doesn't raise any exception
also you need to add `%20` in between `cfe mexico`
Then, still not working :disappointed:
I think all you need is `//c-wiz/div/div/c-wiz/a/text()`
or `//*[@class='nuEeue hzdq5d ME7ew']/text()`
You did it! But I got the title `&lt;a href="actual url I want to import too"&gt;Title I just imported, and that's great!&lt;/a&gt;`
so you would pull in both

How? :open_mouth:
`//*[@class='nuEeue hzdq5d ME7ew']/text()` `//*[@class='nuEeue hzdq5d ME7ew']/@href`
In the same line?
I usually separate them
or you can do a list or whatever you want - if your writing it to csv then out put it to a list as a row
BTW, the code that worked was `//c-wiz/div/div/c-wiz/a/text()` :slightly_smiling_face:
if you change the last part to `/@href` that will give you the url
`/text()` gives you linked text , in this case the title
if you wanted the class name you would to `/@class` at the end - ( just to give you an idea how its grabbing pieces of data when you look at the raw html)
This is awesome, thanks again! Returned two lists, ready to work with them... THANKS!
