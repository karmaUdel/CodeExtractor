Why are there two `result`s at the end of `merge`?
`Dict.merge (\key val dict -&gt; Dict.insert key [ val ]) (\key val otherVal dict -&gt; Dict.insert key [ val otherVal dict ]) (\key val dict -&gt; Dict.insert key [ val ]) leftDict rightDict Dict.empty`
the first one is your "initial" result, much like you have with foldl and foldr
the second is your return value
Oh!
Makes sense now.
elm reactor doesn't work with native modules??
