U2PTZFKFX : somehow, let me read what is posted first,
U0Z9TPK7S : <@U23SA861Y> I stand corrected. I see now that your suggestion of making a more generic view does make sense. Again thank you for your input.
U0J8D9M2P : Exactly
U0J8D9M2P : <@U635238TG> Thank you
U5ZC6V535 : Hi i am trying to separate my top level messages to sub messages and hence i did: 
```
type GeneratorMsg
    = BoidsGenerated (List Boid)
    | ColoursGenerated (List Color)


type Msg
    = Tick Time.Time
    | UpdateWorld Window.Size
    | GeneratorMsg
```

However, in my  main update function when I use the *BoidsGenerated* message Elm thinks that it is of type *GeneratorMsg* which is correct. In the same time though - in my mind -, it is of type *Msg*. 

Is there a way to be able to handle *Msg* and *GeneratorMsg* interchangeably? Basically, i want to split my update function to smaller functions but I want everything that has to do with generated stuff to be handled by 1 separate function. Then that function will have cases for *BoidsGenerated* and *ColoursGenerated* msgs. --- thanks

U0Z9TPK7S : <@U5ZC6V535> You should declare those as```
type Msg
    = Tick Time.Time
    | UpdateWorld Window.Size
    | GeneratorMsg GeneratorMsg
```

U0Z9TPK7S : But this is going to be confusing; I would recommend to change `type GeneratorMsg` into `type GeneratorOutcome`.Then your update function can be
```
type GeneratorOutcome
 = BoidsGenerated (List Boid)
 | ColoursGenerated (List Color)

type Msg
 = GeneratorMsg GeneratorOutcome
  | ...

update msg model =
  case msg of
    GeneratorMsg generatorOutcome -&gt;
      generatorUpdate generatorOutcome model

    ...
```

U0Z9TPK7S : Does it make sense?
U5ZC6V535 : <@U0Z9TPK7S> Yeah, that actually makes sense :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks.
U0Z9TPK7S : :smiley:
U2LAL86AY : <@U5ZC6V535> i use a `word pattern` for delegating messages to sub modules:```
type Msg = 
  | MsgFor_Generator GeneratorMsg
  | MsgFor_SomethingElse SomethingElseMsg
  | Click  

type GeneratorMsg =  -- no need for GeneratorOutcome, or other variations  - because sometimes "outcome" si a word that doesn't work semantically, and you waste time thinking : "what would be a better naming ?!"
    BoidsGenerated (List Boid)    
    |  ColoursGenerated (List Color)
```
It's how i keep my mind and msgs consistent. :smile:

U2LAL86AY : and in your elm debugger will look like:`MsgFor_Generator ( GenerateSomething { seed: 1112112 })`

U24HQ3RJ7 : hi.. i am new to CSS and have to make a web / mobile app .. I am using Elm for it. :slightly_smiling_face:
Has the community converged on some particular css library ? elm-css vs elm-style-elements vs something_else ..

U0Z9TPK7S : <@U24HQ3RJ7> Hi! Welcome!
U0Z9TPK7S : elm-style-element is still in its infancy, the only complete and solid CSS option right now is elm-css
U24HQ3RJ7 : <@U0Z9TPK7S> thanks.. since this is side project, i will give style-elments a try.. :slightly_smiling_face:
U6EQ9E3EC : Hi there, people
U2MRDAK6U : Hello! :smile: Are there any resources about how to create an Elm library online? I have already made a few standalone projects in Elm, now I would like to make my own library. I know how to use libraries available on <http://package.elm-lang.org|package.elm-lang.org> but I have no idea how to use a local library. Any pointers?
U3SJEDR96 : There's no official way, but there are tools like elm-github-install and elm_self_publish that support installing a local package into another package. Though if it's worth making into a package, you might as well publish is :)
U2MRDAK6U : Great thanks for the tools! `elm_self_publish` seems to do what I want. Are there any plans for a more official method to do this?
U2MRDAK6U : Actually `elm-github-install` seems to do relative paths as well as github repos
U3SJEDR96 : Self publish is useful for testing local modifications and whatnot, elm-github-install is a more comprehensive tool, at the cost of actually replacing most of `elm-package install`'s functionality :slightly_smiling_face:
U6D3ERLA1 : The link from <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/1.1.0/Signal> -&gt; <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Signal> appears to be broken in the docs
U3SJEDR96 : They're also long deprecated..
U1AN4JRFV : <@U6D3ERLA1>: Signals are not longer a thing in 0.18 (latest)
U3SJEDR96 : Pre-0.17 even :D
U6D3ERLA1 : Gotcha - the link is a little misleading...
U3FJSB596 : Hello everyone!
I was recently introduced to Purescript, and it seems to be a nice way to guarantee safety and correctness to my code outside of Elm. I went online to look for articles and tutorials on how to integrate Purescript and Elm but I only found articles pitting these two tools against each other.

So I have the following questions:

1)  What do you think of this? (Using mostly Elm in your FE, and use Purescript beyond your ports)
2) Any suggestions, articles, or tutorials on how to implement this?
3) If you do not use Purescript outside of Elm, what do you do to gain most of Elm’s guarantee’s outside of Elm?

Thanks for your time!

U0LL6NC1K : <@U3FJSB596> i think you might ask this in a more general chat too, like the FPChat Slack (<https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com>). i've written a post about integrating and doing codegen for an elm app inside a purescript one
U3FJSB596 : <@U0LL6NC1K> Thanks for the tip. Where can I find the post you’ve written?
U0LL6NC1K : i think someone posted it here the other week on <#C0CJ671HU|random>? it's here: <http://qiita.com/kimagure/items/d12525d42516f95dd541>
U0LL6NC1K : i'm usually in that other slack, feel free to ping me on <#C0CJ3SBBM|general> or #purescript there :slightly_smiling_face:
U5ZC6V535 : Thanks this looks interesting. I may give that a try.
U170TNSTZ : In React, I can get a reference to a dom element by implementing a `ref` function for a virtual dom node. Is something similar possible in Elm?
U170TNSTZ : I am looking at an example of setting focus, and it seems it’s using the `id` attributes for identification, which is brittle, since it’s a global id
U170TNSTZ : (Example is here: <https://embed.ellie-app.com/vsvWQMXjQqa1/0>)
U0Z9TPK7S : <@U2MRDAK6U> you want `elm package publish`. That's the official way of publishing a library :smiley:
U153UK3FA : <@U170TNSTZ> there isn't a way. 
U2PTZFKFX : Using models seems to be confusing at times analog to the MVC pattern for back end development. won't it be nice to use pattern instead?
U0JFGGZS6 : <@U170TNSTZ> for focus there's <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/dom/1.1.1/Dom#focus>
U2PTZFKFX : Hello, anyone sucessfully implemented bulk actions using ELM?
U0Z9TPK7S : "bulk actions"?
U2PTZFKFX : <@U0Z9TPK7S> yes
U2PTZFKFX : let's say, table with 3 columns`
Actions: update column  newmae: 'mynewname'

id, name, newname
1, testnae, mynewname
2, anothername, mynewname

and so on...
`


[3:03] 
so action update column, supposed to add a bulk action and send the updated result to the server

U0Z9TPK7S : I'm sorry, I'm still missing the context. It might be an API I don't know about. Is this a request going from the browser to a remote server?
U2PTZFKFX : ok
U2PTZFKFX : ok, to further explain, i m loading set of data via api from remote server, which will be contained in a row, later, i want to modify part of all of the record and update back, just like how gmail functionality works, were a user can mark set of messages to be send to trash, or apply some labels to some specific messages,
U0Z9TPK7S : Ok, one thing at the time.Do you need to modify the copy of the records that is in the browser, or the one that's on the server?

U2PTZFKFX : that's on the server, but it will be done from the client side,
U0Z9TPK7S : What part of it will be done on the client side?
U0Z9TPK7S : I assume that within Elm, you are modelling that information as a `List Something`.
U2PTZFKFX : the actions
U0Z9TPK7S : So, you need to create a list of actions that the server will need to perform?
U2PTZFKFX : yes,
U0Z9TPK7S : How you want to model those actions?
U2PTZFKFX : ok, let me start with sample examples
U3L8MM10T : It seems that `Float` has similar limitations as `Int` regarding _maxSafeInt_, as shown here: ```&gt; maxSafeInt = (2 ^ 53) - 19007199254740991 : number
&gt; fmaxSafeInt = toFloat maxSafeInt
9007199254740991 : Float
&gt; fmaxSafeInt + 2.0 - 3.0
9007199254740989 : Float
&gt; fmaxSafeInt - 3.0 + 2.0
9007199254740990 : Float
``` Kindly advise.

U23SA861Y : its backed by js, what were you expecting in large numbers?
U3L8MM10T : I'm not sure myself, but would like to know what max safe upper limit is for `Float`.
U3L8MM10T : Floats to my understanding are inherently imprecise at a certain point.
U3SJEDR96 : Floats are inherently imprecise at any point. `0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3` is  `False`
U3SJEDR96 : An integer is a float without decimals, basically, so for floats that end in `.0`, the limits are the same as for integers
U3SJEDR96 : when comparing floats for equality, you should generally allow for a margin of error (`epsilon`) relative to the inputs
U3L8MM10T : yes, thanks
U3L8MM10T : But I would expect `Basics` to have such an equality function for `Float`.
U4872964V : <@U3L8MM10T> floats are as defined by IEEE 754 double precision floating-point numbers
