U486CN4VD : hi <@U5XHLGL4B>, what is `request`?
U486CN4VD : hrm, I've never used bottle but it looks like `request` is implicit.  Is it safe for me to assume you want to convert the request to json?
U5XHLGL4B : <@U486CN4VD> yeah
U1BP42MRS : <@U486CN4VD> :taco: 
U486CN4VD : Okay, per <https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/api.html#bottle.BaseRequest.json>, it looks like you can only use that method if the content type header is application/json or application/json-rpc. I'm guessing it's not. You can probably see this if you directly print the `request` object. If you still want to force this to json, you can `import json` then use `json.dumps(request)`.
U486CN4VD : thanks, <@U1BP42MRS> :smile:
U1BP42MRS : Thank you for taking time to understand the problem, ask clarifying questions and answer!
U5XHLGL4B : thanks!!
U1BP42MRS : Any tips on forming an LLC would be welcomed. I'm based in the USA (Colorado, specifically)
U1BP42MRS : I'm looking to funnel contract work through the LLC and a few other ventures. 
U29163YQH : ```for v in o:
    print(v['label'])
```

U29163YQH : o is a list
U53E0JYLV : <@U29163YQH> Then I get : TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str
U53E0JYLV : I really don't see what I am doing wrong
U29163YQH : when you load your string as json in `o` it load a list. Because your json is a list
U29163YQH : so you need to iterate over the list to get each label/value inside
U53E0JYLV : ajj
U53E0JYLV : [0]
U29163YQH : ```import json
raw_string = '[{"label":"2012","value":2715016.0},{"label":"2013","value":2911467.0},{"label":"2014","value":3254471.0},{"label":"2015","value":3522816.0},{"label":"2016","value":3906514.0}]'

o = json.loads(raw_string)
for info in o:
    print(info['label'])

```

U53E0JYLV : Thank you
U2HJUKKS5 : Maybe someone has an idea on a bit of a headscratcher I have.I have a project which essentially is a python app with currently npyscreen ui running on a raspberry pi. The idea is that a user can search for games using the app on the pi. Wonderful, works well. The issue is that I'm aiming it for RetroPie, where the majority of it's users only have a controller connected, so no keyboard to enter details. How would I solve this? I was thinking of maybe creating an onscreen keyboard, or perhaps have up and down arrows to go down letters of the alphabet and left and right to move the cursor, but then how do you move to the next input box, or button? Anyone have any ideas?

U29163YQH : how many button are there on a controller ?
U2HJUKKS5 : Well say someone has the bare bones, a NES USB controller, you are looking at 4 buttons and D
U5NMSURAQ : This is the best I've seen. Navigating through almost 100 keys using left/right is a pain.
U2HJUKKS5 : True, but the issue there is that it counts on analog. Many users will have USB retro pads like NES and SNES (myself included) which cannot easily move diagonal let alone hold it there. And the NES USB controller has a total of 4 buttons, with only 2 really free to play with, so that makes this perhaps too difficult
U29163YQH : Can you do long press? 
U2HJUKKS5 : I should imagine so yes
U1NSCAY6R : <@U2HJUKKS5> you could offer two interfaces: one with the controller that is a bit slower for input (maybe also detect NES vs SNES for number of buttons to help us SNES controller users) and another that allows for just using a keyboard as well. i tend to keep a spare logitech wireless keyboard connected to my retropie
