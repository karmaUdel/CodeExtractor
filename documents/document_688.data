U3R7CKQRX : Then I guess this a problem that everybody is facing right? Elm or not.
U0CLDU8UB : That's right. I suppose googling for stackoverflow answers for workarounds might yield something.
U2W22AHNU : <@U3R7CKQRX> not sure about your usecase of course but CSS might be able to help you positioning stuff in the right place while scrolling.
U0CLDU8UB : Yeah, `position: sticky` also exists, even though its browser support is not that great.
U3R7CKQRX : <@U2W22AHNU> I don't really need to position things rather update some content as you scroll.
U3R7CKQRX : Anyway thank you for the help everyone.
U3R7CKQRX : I am just happy this isn't caused by Elm :smile:
U2W22AHNU : <@U3R7CKQRX> Just thought of something, what I do in an other case is to have a loop and requestAnimationFrame```
function loop() {
    _scrollOffset = window.pageYOffset || window.scrollTop;


    requestAnimationFrame(loop);
}
loop();
```

U2W22AHNU : This works well for me in showing and hiding elements based on scroll position.
U2W22AHNU : I develop on a Mac and I can't remember seeing the issue you mentioned
U2W22AHNU : <@U3R7CKQRX> run this: ```var loop = function() {var s = window.pageYOffset || window.scrollTop; console.log(s); requestAnimationFrame(loop);} ``` and then call ```loop();``` in your console and start scrolling
U1P6FFJ64 : <@U17R26VR8> what do you think we have bigger problems?
U0FP80EKB : <@U1P6FFJ64> I’m not mordraw, but I would ask about the term “enforce” which feels like there might be communication issues amongst the 3 people. Do you mean “force” or just “check” ? On my team (also 3), when we upgrade like that, we’ll all chat and do it together.
U0FP80EKB : Especially the first time we notice that in a PR. We’ll say “hey, did someone upgrade their elm-format” and then we’ll all do it.
U1P6FFJ64 : Oh, sorry if that's the case. English is not my native language.
U0FP80EKB : No worries. “enforce” can mean a lot of different things.
U0FP80EKB : It isn’t the wrong word, but can be misunderstood. :slightly_smiling_face:
U0FP80EKB : Is the question just how to make sure everyone is on the same version?
U3SJEDR96 : Mafia "enforcers" come to mind :smile:
U1P6FFJ64 : This is an issue that has happen maybe twice in all the time we have being developing. Is not a big problem, just something that I think it could be automated.
U0FP80EKB : Perhaps a check in a git hook?
U0FP80EKB : some custom script that validates the elm-format version?
U1P6FFJ64 : That's what we will do, add a elm format check on the CI to block PRs that are not using the last elm-format
U0FP80EKB : I don’t know much about the npm stuff, though, so I’m probably not the best to answer it. I don’t think there is anything about the general environment contained in the project-specific files.
U0FP80EKB : I’d ask back whether this is worth the time to do the check and block, as opposed to just communication on the team saying “hey, I upgraded to the latest elm-format, everyone else should”
U0FP80EKB : But, depends on how cumbersome putting the CI check in there is.
U3U2EA14G : Hi all, anyone can help me with this bug ?```

U17R26VR8 : I wouldn’t bother with a check, just when you make your PR, looking at the diffs, it’ll be obvious if elm-format’s different. So the person doing the PR can ask the other two, hey, what version of elm-format should we be on.Problem solved.

U1P6FFJ64 : Well, the CI check will fix this issue in my project but also in the rest of the projects of the company
U1P6FFJ64 : <@U17R26VR8> that's what we currently do. My question was: is there a better way to do it?
U0FP80EKB : If there is cross-team thing, then communication can definitely falter a bit due to siloing. Having a check in that case to have a company-wide standard isn’t too bad.
U1P6FFJ64 : no, there is no cross-team. Just different teams doing entirely different projects.
U0FP80EKB : yeah, that can cause a hangup :slightly_smiling_face:
U17R26VR8 : <@U3U2EA14G> where are you seeing this error? i haven’t seen anything like that before… looks like you are getting a runtime issue?
U0FP80EKB : One thing you could do is actually run the latest elm-format on your CI as part of the build step on a branch.
U0FP80EKB : Or part of the merge task
