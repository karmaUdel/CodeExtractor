U3LT1UTPF : <@U5XHTBFS6> I'm writing an app with leaflet as the main character. I tried using ports, but after watching richard feldman's talk, I opted for writing a custom element. Not sure if that's convinient for all cases, though.
U3LT1UTPF : <https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ar3TakwE8o0>
U3LT1UTPF : I pass the layers I want as a property
U3LT1UTPF : I plan to extract an example from my code some time in the following weeks.
U3LT1UTPF : And publish it
U0J8D9M2P : What is the purpose of `radians` function. It returns the given value.
U3SJEDR96 : Using the `turns`/`radians`/`degrees` functions consistently means that "standard Elm angles" could theoretically be changed without further impact. In practice, there isn't that much values except being explicit about things. `radians 12` says more than `12`
U0J8D9M2P : Is there any packages for Julian Day Numbers?
U0J8D9M2P : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justinmimbs/elm-date-extra/1.0.1> this package had it, but now API for Julian days is removed.
U3SJEDR96 : I think elm-date-extra has that
U3SJEDR96 : ```toJulianDate : Date -&gt; Float
toJulianDate date =
  toTime date / toFloat msPerDay + 2440587.5
```

U3SJEDR96 : (`msPerDay` is part of `Date.Facts` in that package)
U3DQT3ZGC : Hi! How come ```Html.div [] [ text "foo \n bar" ]``` doesn't put bar on a new line but does remove the `\n`
U3DQT3ZGC : I'd like it to but bar on a new line
U3SJEDR96 : That's how it works in regular HTML too. you'll want `Html.div [] [ text "foo", <http://Html.br|Html.br> [] [], text "bar" ]`
U3DQT3ZGC : Ok right. In my case I get a string of css from elm-css that I'd like to render on the page, but with the linebreaks
U3SJEDR96 : Oh. You might want to use `Html.pre [] [ text yourStuff ]` then, which will render it into a "pre"formatted block
U3DQT3ZGC : Ah! Nice :slightly_smiling_face:
U3DQT3ZGC : Thanks!
U5Z3Y472L : Hello
U5Z3Y472L : I'm trying to implement a login form. My view code looks like this :
U5Z3Y472L : view : Model -&gt; Html Msgview model =
     form [ class "w70 center", onSubmit Login ]
          [ label [ for "email", class "row mts" ] [ text "Adresse email"]
          , input [ name "email", type_ "email", class "row", onInput ChangeEmail ][]
          , label [ for "password", class "row mts" ] [ text "Mot de passe"]
          , input [ name "password", class "mbs w70", type_ model.passwordFieldType, onInput ChangePassword, value "" ]
                  [ div
                      [ class "passwordShow" ]
                      [ input
                          [ checked model.isPasswordVisible, type_ "checkbox", onClick TogglePasswordVisibility ]
                          [ text "Afficher"]
                      , a [ onClick Login, class "row btn primary-btn" ]
                          [ div [ class "grid-3-1" ]
                                [ div [ class "txtcenter" ] [ text "Me connecter"]
                                , viewSpinner model.isWaitingConnect
                                ]
                          ]
                      , div [ class "w50 center" ]
                          [ a [ href "#", onClick SendResetLink ] [ text "J'ai oublié mon mot de passe"]
                          , viewSpinner model.isWaitingReset
                          ]
                      ]
                  ]
          ]

viewSpinner : Bool -&gt; Html Msg
viewSpinner isWaiting =
    if isWaiting then
        div []
            [ i [ class "fa fa-spinner fa-pulse fa-lg" ] []
            ]
    else
        div [][]
