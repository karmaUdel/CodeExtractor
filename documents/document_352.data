        (Json.Decode.field "connectionStatus" Json.Decode.string)```
as you can see I have to use `Json.Decode.map7`
yep, that's what I been doing so far.  Because I am a n00b.
which is not ideal as it only goes up to `map8`
yeah definitely use pipeline, it's really nice :stuck_out_tongue:
Anyone used keystonejs together with elm?
I havent personally, but in my experience the choice of backend doesnt really matter when using elm
everything has to go through elm decoders anyway
anyone else encounter an issue with fontawesome when setting up webpack in the elm tutorial?
Are records immutable in Elm? I have been doing `(Model x y z)` for now, when updating the model. `{ model | x = y }` just feels so wrong to me. What am I missing? :confused:
To be clear, your `model` is left untouched after `{ model | x = y }`
Right, so it is basically `(Model x y z)` with Elm taking care of the values that did not change, while I handle the changes?
Absolutely :slightly_smiling_face: You could never use `{ | }` syntax your code would just be more verbose and less readable
Nice, good to know, because manually creating a new model was becoming... tedious at best!
Thank you for clearing that up, <@U2GPAEU1L> :slightly_smiling_face:
No problem
I'll be making *a lot* of Elm tutorials this next little while, so if you ever are confused with something and want a full tutorial to explain it, please ping me, I'd happily make a custom tutorial just for you, especially because a lot of things you struggle with a lot of other people likely struggle with as well! Don't be shy to ping me and ask for help or ask me to make a tutorial for you :slightly_smiling_face:
Elm really is simple :slightly_smiling_face: And I'm happy to convince you of that by explaining _anything and everything_ you find not simple
I'd be grateful for any tips/help/whatever, as I am just starting out.
