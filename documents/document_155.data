awesome :simple_smile: thanks! Another general question: Lets say I want to do a secret poll which will be revealed later to all members, how would I do that?
can I reveal Emoji reactions with a delay?
:bulb: I just enabled Slack calls for this team
Untapped Market: Bots for Twitter Group Chats. Thoughts on how to partake and monetize are encouraged.. :simple_smile:
<@U0LLUCLP3> what would they be for?
I believe the exact same purposes as the bots in Slack!
If so people with existing Slack technologies could possibly sell them to Twitter..
My sincere apologies for the spam and my lack of tech knowledge!
wooo big emojis
:heart:
now *that's* innovation
Between Twitter &amp; Slack..
<@U0LLUCLP3>: I think Slack should focus on their own product and platform :simple_smile:
already quite awesome
but lot of awesomeness remains to be built
No need to change the diet of a winning horse..
Tremendous opportunity for development &amp; work imo.. Thanks for everything.. The End. :sweat_smile:
hey , is it possible to add an attachment for styling to convo.ask ?
Can a slackbot introduce themselves upon being added to a team? Of does it have to only use “im.list” to find channels he's already allowed to post through?
<@U0HKDKHD4> check out <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/examples/slackbutton_bot.js> around line 76
that might help, not sure
I'm very new to this :simple_smile:
I'm not actually using botkit, but I'll reverse eng that concept. Thanks pal
no problem
I think the idea is, you know the user ID of the person that added the integration/app, so send them a DM
