U6D3ERLA1 : Holy snap
U6D3ERLA1 : side effects!
U6D3ERLA1 : Thanks for all the help yinz* I think I'm going to keep bothering you bt I think I can build an application now
U0CQ254F5 : im building a survey where some questions hold conditional logic…if user answers yes, they get shown another related questions, if they answer a certain way, they get rejected…
U0CQ254F5 : im looking at <https://github.com/evancz/elm-sortable-table/blob/master/src/Table.elm> for inpiration
U0CQ254F5 : first question, how would i model that `Question` type that may or may not have additional questions grouped with it?
U0CQ254F5 : `type alias Question = {...}` and `type alias QuestionGroup = List Question`
U0CQ254F5 : or something like `type Question = Singular | Grouped Question`
U0CQ254F5 : after modeling the main `Question` type, I'm stumbling at how I can maintain state within each `QuestionGroup` or if I should keep that out of the module and into global `Model`
U0CQ254F5 : I feel like componentization might fit in this scenario, although i do try to avoid it
U3SQ42JJW : Hi ereryone. Maybe a dump question, but is it possible to have a union type like this```
type Answer = String | Int
```
… and pattern match these… so I can figure out if the answer is a string or an integer?

U2BCXMGKW : <@U3SQ42JJW> you need type constructors there: `type Answer = StringAnswer String | IntAnswer Int`
U2BCXMGKW : then you pattern match based on those:```
case answer of
  StringAnswer string -&gt; ...
  IntAnswer integer -&gt; ...
```

U3SQ42JJW : <@U2BCXMGKW> … thanks. Yes in deed - seems absolutely clear now to me… was a dump question;-)
U3SQ42JJW : :smile:
U2BCXMGKW : <@U0CQ254F5> what do you exactly want to model?
U0CQ254F5 : its kind of a strange concept…but essentially a `SingleQuestion` or a `GroupedQuestion`
U0CQ254F5 : i took an initial pass at it, but it's a mess
U0CQ254F5 : i was hoping to use the `Config data msg` pattern in the elm-sortable-table repo
U2BCXMGKW : do you want to have a type that might have a singular question or a question with some list of other questions? maybe something like:
```type QuestionAndRelated = Single Question | Grouped Question (List Question)```

U3SQ42JJW : haha :joy: seems like everyone is building surveys… me too…
U2BCXMGKW : I don't like the name of the type, but you get the idea
