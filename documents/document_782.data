U0H3A9XLN : unfortunately I can’t just copy paste my code and it won’t be trivial to make it now
U0H3A9XLN : maybe you can better point me to some advanced form examples?
U4872964V : it’s hard when I don’t know what your pain is, or what your forms are, unfortunately
U4872964V : but if you have multiple `RemoteData` it may help to use one of the `map` functions, or `andMap` on them
U0H3A9XLN : ok, thanks
U2LAL86AY : <@U0H3A9XLN> are you using the `_ -&gt;` pattern  in `case of` ?```
case remoteData  of 
   Success .. -&gt; 
               showSomeHtml
   _ -&gt; 
        text "" 
```

U2LAL86AY : actually it's better to use <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/bloom/remotedata/1.0.1/RemoteData#map> - for success and<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/bloom/remotedata/1.0.1/RemoteData#mapFailure> -&gt; for failure

U0H3A9XLN : no, I do not use wildcard
U0H3A9XLN : That was not about `map`, I should have formed question better. I know about the libraries API, I was really looking into different way of data modelling, not into suggestions for methods to use :slightly_smiling_face:
U4872964V : <@U0H3A9XLN> a different way than _what_ is the obvious question. If you can't provide an example on how your code looks now it's extremely hard to suggest improvements.
U2LAL86AY : hmm i'm curious to understand why this is not considered a compile error: ```
import Style.Color as Color
import Color

....
someBackground = Color.background Color.red 
```
 where in fact is: 
```
someBackground = Style.Color.background Color.red 
```
Gets confusing to know if `red` is from `Style.Color` or from `Color` - elmjutsu shows intelisense for both combined. - i mean not so confusing for red - but i'm worried about the implications for other function names if this is allowed

U3SJEDR96 : If there is real confusion possible, I think you do get a compiler error:```
This usage of variable map is ambiguous.
Maybe you want one of the following?

List.map
String.map
```

U2LAL86AY : aa ok. So only if `red` is defined in both packages... then i get that error.. hmm
U3SJEDR96 : indeed
U3SJEDR96 : aliasing multiple modules to the same name is intentional; and allows things like `import List.Extra as List` to "combine" modules
U3SJEDR96 : I agree that it's occasionally pretty confusing, tho
U170TNSTZ : Anybody using `create-elm-app`?
U170TNSTZ : Anyways, I have some problems with the hot reloading. It works, and maintains the state of the model, until I encounter a compilation error. If I mess up the syntax or types, the reload will of course fail, but fixing the code afterwards will kill the state
U0CL0AS3V : <@U0H3A9XLN> if you're looking for alternative ways to model data, <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example> does initialization on "page" load rather than using `RemoteData`. If you don't need parts of your page to load in pieces, this style makes your `Model` easier to work with.
U170TNSTZ : Re: my own post - Seems it’s a “bug” in `elm-hot-loader`. I created an issue here: <https://github.com/fluxxu/elm-hot-loader/issues/34>
U0H3A9XLN : <@U0CL0AS3V> yeah, I’ve seen it and I really enjoyed the idea. However I do now embed Elm into React application, so top level routing is done by React :disappointed:
