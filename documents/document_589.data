U5W9X7VP1 : <@U153UK3FA>: can you point me to correct direction. If an article is read from API, in a SPA, how can the server change the meta tags at all as the page is not reloaded?
U153UK3FA : and you can use `Maybe.map` to transform the value if it's not `Nothing`
U0JBSEGHY : I'm not quite sure what the Maybe's do. Brb reading
U3SJEDR96 : <@U5W9X7VP1> for meta tags to work, they have to be on the page when the url is fetched by facebook/twitter for loading the metadata. So, they pretty much have to be rendered server-side.
U5W9X7VP1 : <@U3SJEDR96>, hmm, ok. I have to think about this. Google seems to be able to index after running javascript so dynamic meta tags work there, but I guess FB doesn't do this - yet.
U5W9X7VP1 : So world is still not ready :disappointed:
U3SJEDR96 : Yeah, though I don't think even google can handle a page that first fetches data from an API before being able to set meta tags
U0JBSEGHY : Would you still suggest the `case..of` block <@U153UK3FA>
U5W9X7VP1 : <@U3SJEDR96>, yes, google seems to index correctly after injecting content fetched with a HTTP request. (<https://centrical.com/test/google-json-ld-and-javascript-crawling-and-indexing-test.html>) Not sure about other search engines. But yeah, that doesn't help here. Maybe I'll do fine without dynamic meta tags.
U3SJEDR96 : That's interesting, thanks for that link :slightly_smiling_face:
U0JBSEGHY : I can't figure out how to satisfy this type ```    Maybe ( a, b ) -&gt; c
But the right side is:

    ( a, b ) -&gt; b```

U153UK3FA : <@U0JBSEGHY> what code is producing that type error?
U0JBSEGHY : I feel like I am stabbing in the dark :laughing:
U153UK3FA : You should read the Maybe docs
U153UK3FA : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Maybe>
U153UK3FA : Just like List.map allows you to apply a function to values contained within a List, Maybe.map allows you to apply a function to a value contained within a Maybe. 
U0JBSEGHY : Ok I wasn't trying map because I only have one Tuple in a list
U0JBSEGHY : But that did the trick.
U0JBSEGHY : Feel so nooby. Thats me for the night!
U5E3DU81K : How would I display some text in an elm page, where the text is in a .txt file.
U0L27J3N0 : <@U5E3DU81K> you put the text file on some server (like the one that is serving your Elm app) and you retrieve it with a `Http.getString`
U5E3DU81K : aha - thanks.
U3HQVHERX : is there a guide on integrating sass compiling into `create-elm-app`? also, `create-elm-app` seems pretty heavy. what are some other options people use?
U3HQVHERX : haha, just read the bottom of the readme - they list a bunch of other options
U6G82P7V1 : I'm tinkering with the `HTTP` example in the _Introduction to Elm_-guide (cat gif fetcher). Having added a textfield to my view and via `onInput` hooked it to the `topic`-property in `Model`, I am now able to enter another word and fetching a gif on another topic when pressing the button.At present there is also a regular text element displaying `topic`, so whenever I alter the value of the text field, the regular text element also changes. I would rather have the regular text element change to the new word only when a new image is loaded (on the button click event for instance).

U6G82P7V1 : With jQuery or even regular Javascript, I would probably have captured the input elements value on the button click event, but I am now pondering how to go about acheiving this in the most _Elmy_ way possible...
U6G82P7V1 : Should I add another field to the `Model` (say, `topicInput`), hook that up to the input element and on the button click render a new `Model` where I set `topic` to the value of `topicInput`, or how would a more seasoned Elm programmer go about doing this?
U3SJEDR96 : Something like that, although I'd pass the "topic to set" with the message that contains the new data
U3SJEDR96 : so if, for some reason, they arrive out of order, my model (and view) will stay consistent
U3SJEDR96 : so it would be something like `Http.send (GotCatsResponse "new topic here")`
U6G82P7V1 : Thanks!
U6G82P7V1 : Is this the way to go about these sort of things in general? Say I have a registration form of some kind were the user is asked to enter details into several text fields, and I want to present him or her with a summary, but don't want this summary to update as they are typing but rather after everything is filled out. Will I need to add duplicate fields to my entire model?
U3LUC6SNS : I've managed to deploy the Elixir/Phoenix backend to Heroku for the project I am working on, and would now like to do the same with the Elm frontend.  The frontend is running locally using webpack.  What do you recommend?
U3SJEDR96 : <@U6G82P7V1> you'd have to duplcate the data in your model, yeah, though depending on the usecase you'd build an abstraction over that like `type FieldValue = Validated String | Dirty String String`
U3SJEDR96 : so it wouldn't be duplicating fields per sé.
U6G82P7V1 : <@U3SJEDR96> I think I understand what you're saying, thanks for your help :slightly_smiling_face:
U3LUC6SNS : I need to set the url for the app's backend depending on whether the app is running locally (development) or remotely (production).  How would I do that?
U0LPMPL2U : Have you used flags before?
U0LPMPL2U : This article shows how to use flags and webpack to pass in environment variables: <https://robots.thoughtbot.com/configuring-an-elm-app-with-environment-variables-via-webpack>
U3SQ42JJW : <@U3LUC6SNS> I did that via javascript by getting the current URL -&gt; this sets a flag which is loaded into my model - so I can use the backend-host on every request
U3LUC6SNS : @marscho --- Fantastic - thanks!
U3LUC6SNS : Have you used webpack for deployment (Heroku or elsewhere).  I just deployed the backend, so this is the next step.
U3SQ42JJW : No my deployment is done with git. I only want to decide if i am on localhost or on the prod environment

```
// The host is ported to elm to set the api-endpoint on startup
var host = window.location.hostname === 'localhost'
    ? '<http://localhost:3000>'
    : '<https://playground.devpunx.com>'
```

U3SQ42JJW : pretty simple. So the elm-app just checks on startup (when the browser loads the elm-app) where it is. That sets the flag which is loaded into the model on my model initialization
U3SQ42JJW : But I think this is completely independent of which deployment process you use. The decision which endpoint the api should connect to is done during runtime of the elm app… so to say…
U3SQ42JJW : launching with flags looks in my js file like this```
// prepare the flags-object
var flags = {
    token: token,
    settings: settings,
    apiEndpoint: host,
    random: random
}

// Launch Elm with flags
var node = document.getElementById("app")
var app  = Elm.Main.embed(node, flags)
```

U3SQ42JJW : In my elm model, the apiEndpoint is just a string with localhost or the prod-server adress. In requests I then can just use `model.apiEndpoint ++ "/getStuff"`
U3SQ42JJW : Summing things up… you dont need to respect this in the deployment or build process. Just make your app sensitive on where it is launched…
U3LUC6SNS : Thankyou!  One more question - how do you deploy with git?
U3SQ42JJW : Well, that is not for real prod environments - but basically for my personal experiments.I have the code on git already. On my remote server I have a clone of that git which is configured as remote on my local git. 

When I want to deploy I just push my release branch to the remote git. Then a script on the remote machine checks out the release branch and boom .. release done…

U3SQ42JJW : I know that's "poor mans deployment" :wink:
U3SQ42JJW : but works fast
