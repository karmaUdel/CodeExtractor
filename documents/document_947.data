U13J58K0T : Does anyone know how do you handle ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE errors with react.js? I have a component drawing data from a remote API [<https://cosmicjs.com/>] but every time I add it to my app with live data, the server returns no data and fails. there is no way for me to find out what is going on if I cannot debbug as the page timesout.  Any best practices or debugging tools?

U1MB9DLDN : hi everyone
U1QB8MXC6 : Marc Wensauer <@U1QB8MXC6> 16:52<https://gist.github.com/daslicht/25c6000ee37ca1a32f827b34284a75a6#file-gistfile1-txt-L14>


on first load this.props.url is
valid
but at the second call , from teh setIntervall this.props is

why ?

U0DKUDX7Y : well if I am right.. and you put the setInterval into the constructor it calls only once.. if you want refresh the property state you should use one of the component lifecycle method like componentWillReceiveProps check this<https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html>

U1ZBNTTLL : what is the best way to pass props down a component hierarchy from parent to children without duplication.  Are contextTypes the best way?
U1BC67ULB : what do you mean `without duplication`?
U1ZBNTTLL : I mean so I don't continually have to pass the same props down to each child
U1BC67ULB : `this.props.children`
U1BC67ULB : ```&lt;foo&gt;{this.props.children}
&lt;/foo&gt;```

U1ZBNTTLL : I mean if I have an action like update.  I think contextTypes is what I am after
U1ZBNTTLL : when does proptype validation occur in the lifecycle of a component?
U0DKUDX7Y : At render time, React calls the function checkPropTypes for each component to be rendered, passing in the componentName, props, propTypes and location.checkPropTypes iterates over the supplied propTypes, calling each function in turn with the relevant props, propName, componentName and location. If the returned value is of type Error or if the function throws an exception, the error's message is written out to the console via React's warning function (using console.warn).

U24D14SCA : Hello does anybody know how to cache React components?
U282V6GUD : <@U21QB16AF>: you have to run a we server to see localhost:8080, for example with node or phyton, from the terminal run the server on the directory of your project 
U22NNSZJB : Hey guys, I want some help about internacionalization... I'm with some troubles to implement in my application the `react-intl`.

U3423TQRE : Hello! My name is Hernan i'm from Argentina and i'm currently using react with laravel
U34A9GS9F : does anyone know of a tool like react-resource, but can be pulled in through a CDN? trying to throw together a simple demo
U1BC67ULB : <@U34A9GS9F> what’s wrong with codepen/js-fiddle?
U34A9GS9F : demoing how react would look if used in our existing app. No worries though, I'm presenting today :sweat_smile:
U1BC67ULB : good luck! (what did you use?)
U34A9GS9F : Thanks! Just used jQuery ajax, but I'll be sure to point out react-resource as a possibility if we go with React
U38DDL22E : hi all! im pretty new to react and have a create-react-app. it is on heroku but now i am having an issue with deploying an update. getting the error 'cannot find file or module lib/reactDOM'. i import ReactDOM from 'react-dom' in my index.js file where i call ReactDom.render(). any insight into this would be appreciated.
U0DKUDX7Y : hm try to remove node_modules, clean npm cache and run npm install ..also check version of node and npm ..if it fit with create-react-app
U38DDL22E : thanks <@U0DKUDX7Y>! i will try cleaning the cache
U3423TQRE : Hi!
U3423TQRE : ajax and laravel anyone?
U39RXQG73 : <!here|@here> hi everyone!I am trying to find JS lib or react component which can create/drag&amp;drop some polygons (usually rectangles).
Any idea? :slightly_smiling_face:

U256P9YJX : Hi <@U39RXQG73> did You checked it <https://github.com/okonet/react-dropzone>. I didn't test it but this seems to fit Your requirement
U39RXQG73 : <@U256P9YJX> thanksSeems that it does not provide an user to change width/height of already created rectangle :disappointed:

U0DKUDX7Y : question for 1mil ... I've started one quite big project.. using redux redux-thunk and react... 
after I made my first action, reducer for homepage.. I realized that I am not sure where I should put the validations like async response when something is wrong with API but also field validation...
I've checked a lot of articles... some of them are telling put it into action reators and reducers... but Dan Abramov is allways telling "keep reducer simple stupid" ... so I am a bit confused... Does any1 has the experience with it??
Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:

U1Y4XEX7D : <@U0DKUDX7Y> What about putting API async call and response manipulation on actions? For instance there you can subscribe to a certain behaviour and then do something with the response:
```
// Let's say you want to get a dog from an api that exposes dogs
export const fetchDog = (id) =&gt; (dispatch) =&gt; {
  dogsApi.getDogById(id).subscribe(
    (data) =&gt; {
      console.log('this is my dog', data);
      dispatch(doSomethingWithDog(data)); //this is another action where you now manipulate the response
    },
    (error) =&gt; {
      console.log('parsing failed', error);
    },
    () =&gt; {}
  );
};
```

U1Y4XEX7D : Then the appropiate reducer should know what to do with the state after you have done the request
U0DKUDX7Y : <@U1Y4XEX7D> yeah I am doing something like that .. in my action.js file
export function loadRestaurants() {
  return function (dispatch) {
    return fetch('API_URL_HERE').then(
      restaurants =&gt; dispatch(loadRestaurantsSuccess(restaurants)),
      errors =&gt; dispatch(loadRestaurantsError(errors))
    );
  };
}

and in my reducer

...
case types.LOAD_RESTAURANTS_ERROR:
      console.log('reducer: ', action);
      return action.errors;
...

what is weird and I don't know why..that the error is pushed into store.restaurants but not into store.errors =/

U256P9YJX : <@U0DKUDX7Y> in this project any validation is made, maybe will help You <https://github.com/rajaraodv/react-redux-blog>
U256P9YJX : Here is description that author made <https://medium.com/@rajaraodv/a-guide-for-building-a-react-redux-crud-app-7fe0b8943d0f>
U0DKUDX7Y : <@U256P9YJX>  thanks, I will check these articles :slightly_smiling_face:
U256P9YJX : Is it possible that one action has been started before another has been finished and hence this problem occurs? If Yes, how to prevent it?
U3AE4EF6D : Hello there, I’m not sure if this is the right place but as we say in my country “Who tries nothing get’s nothing” so I’ll try anyway. I’m struggling getting images dynamically displayed. What I mean by that is that I have a react-relay-graphql stack, the users have an image path in their data and I try to display it using &lt;img src={item.image} /&gt; and everytime I do this, I get an error that the module “path to file” does not exist. Any thoughts on how to solve this properly? I use it with webpack, so maybe this is an issue. Also, the file is always there in a folder on top that is called assets (just if this helps by any means). Anyway, I hope this is clear enough (and on the right place).

U22NNSZJB : <!channel> Hey people, I made some classes about basic React in my youtube channel.
In the future I'll tell about more complex stuffs, like i18n, tests, and Redux architecture.
But, for now, it has some basic React tutorials.
