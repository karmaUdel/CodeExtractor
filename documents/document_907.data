U0LSCQQNR : your second example would work with json, with some property name changes
U5ZPMJA06 : <@U1S0UD5DH> I'd call it a list of attributes and their values.
U6BM4GY0G : Does anyone here have any experience using prompt_toolkit library? <https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit>
U5ZPMJA06 : <@U6BM4GY0G> Looks interesting. Why are you looking for someone with experience with this module?
U6BM4GY0G : I would love to see what others have built using that library just for inspiration <@U5ZPMJA06>. Found it while exploring "Haxor-News" source code on github but that source code is a bit too complicated for me to understand since I dont have several years of experience in Python.
U6BM4GY0G : I am currently building myself a cli password manager just to learn more python and I would love to utilize prompt_toolkit for this project.
U5CGPBF0U : I'm not sure why I'm getting this error. Do I need to manually import geoalchemy2 in the auto-generated migration script?
U1UFZTD4J : <@U5CGPBF0U> yes
U5CGPBF0U : <@U1UFZTD4J> Thanks! Did the trick :smile:
U5CGPBF0U : I still can't get PostGIS's `ST_DWithin` to work. I followed this tutorial <https://www.compose.com/articles/geofile-everything-in-the-radius-with-postgis/> step by step and my query still returns no results. I don't see any difference between what I'm doing and what's going on in the tutorial...
U5VGKQ2SY : Hey guys. Just posted this: <https://github.com/khdc-me/citi-bikes/tree/master/01-num_bikes_to_purchase> and was wondering if you guys had any suggestions on how to speed up this part of it```

U5VGKQ2SY : csv file that it looks through has between 500K and 600K records. There are 12 files, roughly same size that it gets fed one at a time. Takes anywhere from 5 to 7 seconds per file.

U5VGKQ2SY : Looks really nice and condensed... Runs at about the same speed though. But am definitely subbing this into my repo. :smile:

U4PRU7MPD : Good morning.  I am working with Socket for the first time. I have hit on an error and it is so generic google is not very useful this morning.  I was hoping to get some direction I get error 54 connection reset.   I am going to supply the full script as a snip right after this message.  This is a super basic thing to download some RFC as a test of learning Sockets a bit.
U5LNXQHN3 : "socket" is lower-case, by the way... it's not a package, it's just a low-level networking concept. Error 54 / "connection reset" is just an obscure way of the operating system telling you that the connection was closed.
U5LNXQHN3 : It is usually helpful to know which line the error came from (it'll be in the traceback). It also looks like your HTTP request is missing a blank line after the header, but maybe I've misremembered that part
U5NMSURAQ : True
