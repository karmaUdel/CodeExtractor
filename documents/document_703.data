could the tags coming through as a python data structure as a string have somethign to do with it?
i've been banging my head on this for hours.  and you saying strange indeed gave me some validation that is helping me to not go crazy haha
wait, what do you mean coming through as a python data structure?
it's getting placed in the url like this `['lol', 'dog']` but encoded
`/%5B%27lol%27%2C%20%27dog%27%5D?`
Works either way :confused:
hmmmmmmm
`J0HWW-lwQAAAF0HWW-jjgAAAFoAKAA%253D%253D` != `J0HWW-lwQAAAF0HWW-jjgAAAFoAKAA%3D%3D`. % sign in debug token got url encoded to %25
?
If I'm trying to parse some xml should I be using something like `beautifulsoup`?
I've not used beautifulsoup, but if it is just xml there are other xml libraries
why not lxml :slightly_smiling_face:
it's got `xml` in its name
I believe that is the one I liked.
It can parse xml without you having to know anything about the content.
and beautifulsoup only has `soup`...
ah, and `beautiful`..
be sure to use `defusedxml` if you are parsing unknown xml
Yeah I saw there was some possibility of malicious xml with certain libraries unable to deal with it
Why does xml seem so much more annoying than json... ugh
because it is ? :smile:
oh wow <@U653RFLBD> i see what you are saying.  it's not failing at the flask level, it's failing at the instagram fetch level because the token is wrong
Yeah, I would much prefer json.
Woo `from lxml import etree` can't find reference to etree :smile:
`import lxml.etree as etree`
`tree = etree.fromstring(binary_data)`
`no module named etree`
:open_mouth:
gonna stick with just xml.etree lol
pip installed and everything
odd
enjoy slow parsing :slightly_smiling_face:
but yeah, pretty strange
Slow and frustrating.
lxml should really be in the standard library.
well, `xml` already is and they share an interface (I think)
