U0EUHKVGB : The debugger uses a bunch of customized thing for the virtual-dom in order to display things usefully
U0EUHKVGB : If you disable the debugger, or just compile it locally, then your file works

U0NGNUH4J : Hello, community! :smile:
I’m building a simple product library to experiment with “making impossible states impossible”.

As the model suggests products can be simple one-off things or a group of products.

*Question*: I have a problem with naming collisions and feel like I’m running out of names. Any ideas about what could be done with the types here?

```
type alias Model =
    { products : List ProductType }


type ProductType
    = Product
    | ProductGroup


type alias Product =
    { name : String
    , price : Float
    }


type alias ProductGroup =
    { name : String
    , firstProduct : Product
    , otherProducts : List Product
    }
```

U5J0H2NS2 : I used to name the type aliases (constructors) like ProductConstructor
U5J0H2NS2 : your type should be something like
U5J0H2NS2 : ```type ProductType
  = Product ProductConstructor
  | ProductGroup ProductGroupConstructor
```

U3SJEDR96 : I think I'd actually go for something like
U3SJEDR96 : ```type ProductInfo = { name : String, price : Float }

type Product
  = Product ProductInfo
  | Group String (NonEmptyList Product)

type alias Model = List Product
```

U0NGNUH4J : ahaa
U5J0H2NS2 : your original ProductType is only an "Enum"
U3SJEDR96 : well, `NonEmpty` actually, using mgold/elm-nonempty-list
U0NGNUH4J : I see
U0NGNUH4J : ```type ProductInfo = { name : String, price : Float }
```

U0NGNUH4J : supposed to be a type alias?
U3SJEDR96 : urhm, yeah
U0NGNUH4J : :+1:
U3SJEDR96 : I wish slack would give me compiler errors :stuck_out_tongue:


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
