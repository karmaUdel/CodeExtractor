Hey
Hi. Does anyone know how can i render React components from html string (which i received from my database) ? if i use dangerouslySetInnerHTML i can't bind any methods onClick or other manipulations
<@U43CA9E5R> , I think you shouldn't do that. Component should be packed to bundle before using it for best performance
<@U2JTYR6L9>  thank u for ur answer. How can i bind any methods for content that i render from HTML string? for example, i have HTML string with text and images and i have to make each image clickable to show it full version.  How can i perform this? maybe i should not store it as HTML string but as raw content from draft.js. But even in this case i have to parse it on fly when i receive server response

hi mates, I have a problem
I have a component Element. I have a loop where I create multiple Elements
each Element has an state calls owner
and when the component its created I call and action in order to update the owner
but the states of all Elements update with the same value
like they were sharing their states
How could I fix that? :confused:
what’s your code look like <@U48T17H6G>
my component:
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(GalleryElement);
the reducer:
}
the action:
}
And how I render the component:
        })
so, when I call requestOwner action from each component, the state is shared to all of them and this shouldn't happen
emesislol: You should do the request outside of your GalleryElement. Let’s say on gallery container. And then, store each information you want to fetch within an array with a common state key, for example `{ ‘gallery-owners’: [] }`. Then when you’re mapping each GalleryElement you should pass the corresponding index of that array of information you want to pass.
thanks <@U43PCD4KC> ! I will try to do that :smile:
Let me know if you find a better approach :slightly_smiling_face:

Hello
I have a question about arrays mapped to &lt;ul&gt;. When I change a value in the array, it’s appending me the whole list again, rather than rendering that value. Any ideas how to fix this problem?
can i see your code? <@U4MN5U6H5>
<@U1BC67ULB> Here it is <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42893798/react-is-not-updating-elements-on-firebase-event/42894671>
Hello, also new to React from (a bit of) angular :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U1BC67ULB> Found the problem. It wasn’t a React problem, it was just JS problem. I was not emptying the list, so of course React was appending :laughing:
