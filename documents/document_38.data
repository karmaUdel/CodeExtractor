or ```Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY``` in CLJS
!! thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
hey guys
what's you're preferred method of checking for nils before assignation ?
<@U0GC1C09L> see also <https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1074>
i just realized I am repeating `(:username respone)` when I `(if-not (nil? (:username response) (:username response) fallback-value))`
isn't there a syntactic sugar around this ?
