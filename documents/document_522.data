List (ApiEntity { username : String })```
Since the type variable in `Entity a` is a row type, your type alias should be `type alias UserEntity = ApiEntity {username : String}`
I'm not sure to get it
Ideally I don't want to change my `User` type which contains an uuid already
and so is an `Entity` no?
`User == Entity { username : String }`
The only problem you have is the annotation on fromList. Change it to `fromList : List a -&gt; List (ApiState a)` and it compiles.

ok but that's weird
the type shouldn't be constrained on `a` ?
The more specific version `fromList : List User -&gt; List UserEntity` works too
ah I didn't see you changed ApiEntity to ApiState
of course it compiles
but that's not what I want
what do you want?
<@U5Q42DDMJ> `type alias ApiEntity a = ApiState (Entity a)` if `a` _is_ an `Entity something` means you have `Entity (Entity something)`, no?
ah yes brilliant <@U3SJEDR96>
