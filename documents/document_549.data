<@U3R7CKQRX> run this: ```var loop = function() {var s = window.pageYOffset || window.scrollTop; console.log(s); requestAnimationFrame(loop);} ``` and then call ```loop();``` in your console and start scrolling
<@U17R26VR8> what do you think we have bigger problems?
<@U1P6FFJ64> I’m not mordraw, but I would ask about the term “enforce” which feels like there might be communication issues amongst the 3 people. Do you mean “force” or just “check” ? On my team (also 3), when we upgrade like that, we’ll all chat and do it together.
Especially the first time we notice that in a PR. We’ll say “hey, did someone upgrade their elm-format” and then we’ll all do it.
Oh, sorry if that's the case. English is not my native language.
No worries. “enforce” can mean a lot of different things.
It isn’t the wrong word, but can be misunderstood. :slightly_smiling_face:
Is the question just how to make sure everyone is on the same version?
Mafia "enforcers" come to mind :smile:
This is an issue that has happen maybe twice in all the time we have being developing. Is not a big problem, just something that I think it could be automated.
Perhaps a check in a git hook?
some custom script that validates the elm-format version?
That's what we will do, add a elm format check on the CI to block PRs that are not using the last elm-format
I don’t know much about the npm stuff, though, so I’m probably not the best to answer it. I don’t think there is anything about the general environment contained in the project-specific files.
I’d ask back whether this is worth the time to do the check and block, as opposed to just communication on the team saying “hey, I upgraded to the latest elm-format, everyone else should”
But, depends on how cumbersome putting the CI check in there is.
