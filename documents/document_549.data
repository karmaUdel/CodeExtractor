U1UGYHGCA : `Json.Decode.map` probably
U14Q8S4EM : Here is some code I wrote up that decodes to a union type <@U5ABF3BH7>
U14Q8S4EM : <https://github.com/Chadtech/Chadtech-Online-2-Post-Composer/blob/master/source/Types/Model.elm>
U14Q8S4EM : Checkout the functions `ContentDecoder` and `ContentDecoderHelp`
U3FJSB596 : Or `Json.Decode.andThen`
U5ABF3BH7 : <@U14Q8S4EM>  <@U1UGYHGCA> Thanks a lot!
U1UGYHGCA : ```locationDecoder: Decoder LocationType
locationDecoder =
  Json.Decode.field "type_" Json.Decode.string
  |&gt; Json.Decode.map (\type_ -&gt; case type_ of
    "Person's Residence" -&gt; PersonResidence
    "In Transport" -&gt; InTransport
    -- ...
    _ -&gt; Other
  )
```

U1UGYHGCA : Might work
U5W86UED6 : oh! you wouldn't - I was supposing that `average` should be defined as `List Float -&gt; Float`, putting the burden on the part of the program that generates the list, rather than on the function. but your solution is exactly the way to satisfy his original question
U3FJSB596 : With this version, you do not need to add a new value `Other` to your `LocationType`.
U6D3ERLA1 : ```mapGrid func grid =
    let
        mapRows y row =
            Array.indexedMap (mapColumns y) row

        mapColumns y x val =
            func x y val
    in
        Array.indexedMap mapRows grid


updateMarker p k =
    \x y val -&gt;
        if p.x == x &amp;&amp; p.y == y then
            k
        else
            val

debug = mapGrid updateMarker { x = 1, y = 1 } "X" initBoard
    |&gt; log "Map"
```

U6D3ERLA1 : Maybe someone can help me with this.... I'm trying to pass updateMarker to mapGrid with two paramaters (a point and a key) which will be evaluated inside of map grid - along with the current grid location (x, y)
U14Q8S4EM : <https://gist.github.com/Chadtech/81a96e4facab7a3dc9196e2811ce6c08/edit>
U6D3ERLA1 : Maybe I need to curry updateMarker before passing to mapgrid..
U14Q8S4EM : <@U6D3ERLA1> , thats how I would write your code. Tho I am not sure given your use case things need to be this convoluted.
U6D3ERLA1 : <@U14Q8S4EM> I think that gist is private
U14Q8S4EM : <https://gist.github.com/Chadtech/81a96e4facab7a3dc9196e2811ce6c08>
U14Q8S4EM : Doops.
U14Q8S4EM : Thats the correct link
U5ABF3BH7 : <@U1UGYHGCA> <@U3FJSB596> Thanks, I will give it a try!
U1CHKCKBR : hey, i want to start learning elm; what would be the proper way to start ?
U2U94G0QG : <@U1CHKCKBR> start with <https://guide.elm-lang.org/> and also the FAQ (see channel topic)
U2U94G0QG : and of course ask here when questions come up
U1CHKCKBR : :wink: ty <@U2U94G0QG>
U2U94G0QG : I'm doing <https://www.gitbook.com/book/johncrane/ninety-nine-elm-problems/details>
U2U94G0QG : which is fun and more about using the language than building web apps with TEA
U1CHKCKBR : i like the way it's structured
U6DQCTZT2 : How do I transform Time (Float) to Int?
U6DQCTZT2 : I guess I don't? I just have to use Int for the type declaration?
U14Q8S4EM : <@U6DQCTZT2> `round` or `floor`
U2U94G0QG : <@U1CHKCKBR> have you seen <https://ellie-app.com/new> yet?
U2U94G0QG : really nice way to play with Elm - 0 config
U2U94G0QG : though personally I prefer <https://ellie-app.com/new?vim=true>  :wink:
U6DQCTZT2 : <@U14Q8S4EM> thanks!
U23SA861Y : <@U6DQCTZT2> what value do you want out, there are conversion functions to give you an number in a relavent unit
U6D3ERLA1 : Hmmm well this seems to do what I want (map a coordinate and key to a grid) but it seems like too many args for the inner function not sure if there is  a better way```
mapGrid f grid =
    Array.indexedMap (mapRow f) grid


mapRow f y row =
    Array.indexedMap (mapDatum (f y)) row


mapDatum f y x =
    f x y


putY p k x v y =
    if p.x == x &amp;&amp; p.y == y then
        k
    else
        v


debug =
    mapGrid (putY { x = 0, y = 0 } "*") initBoard
        |&gt; log "Map"
```

U6DQCTZT2 : <@U23SA861Y> Random.initialSeed needed to be an Int and so I used the round function. Was looking for something like Time.toInt, but just me being stupid ;D
U23SA861Y : right, if you weren't using the actual time value then thats ok.
U23SA861Y : so you went with array of array huh?
U6D3ERLA1 : y
U4H406NET : I am trying to construct a Result object with an error and Result.Result tells me that Result does not expose Result (Result by itself tells me that Result is not a variable)  How do you create a Result?
U23SA861Y : well, because this putY if you used a dict would just be `Dict.insert (x,y) value grid`
U5ABF3BH7 : I have a designing question. In my view, I have different persons ( of Person.Model) used in my Model, for example model.caller, or as element of the list model.other People
Each person has a list of roles of  
```
type alias Person = 
  { firstName : String
  ….
 , roles : List PersonRole
} 

type PersonRole = 
   Informant
  | PrimaryPurchaser
  | NextOfKin
  | SurveyRecipient
  | CoPurchaser
```
 
The different roles are presented as checkboxes in the personview person. 
Some roles can go to only one person some have no restriction. For example, there can be only one informant , some roles like nextOfKin don't have that restriction.
so you can have ``` person1.roles = [Informant, NextOfKin] person2.roles= [PrimaryPurchaser, NextOfKin]```  but not ```person1.roles = [Informant], person2.roles = [Informant, NextOfKin]```
so Informant can be used only for 1 person.

I have been going back and forth with different ideas on how to model that and would appreciate advice. 
One idea is to create a dict of unique roles in my model
uniqueRoles = { (Informant, Maybe Person.Model), (PrimaryPurchaser : Maybe Person.Model), …}

On a person view  the checkbox ‘informant' needs to be disabled if the person is not the informant, but it needs to be enabled if the person has that role or no informant has been selected yet, I am thinking of adding  ```[disabled (Dict.get Informant model.uniqueRoles == Nothing || Dict.get Informant model.uniqueRoles == person)]```

It seems a bit much, any other idea?

U6D3ERLA1 : <@U23SA861Y> I'm translating from an existing js app so the array map (pun intended) pretty directly I'll look at the Dict implementation as well I'm just trying to get some chops so not much to lose trying a couple ways
U23SA861Y : if they are arrays you should be able to index directly


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
