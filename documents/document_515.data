U2SR9DL7Q : Domino is used everywhere in the code base...
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U236M9FH9> Anyway, we got it to not complain ^^ . Thanks very much. That repl idea was great.
U236M9FH9 : Yup, REPL is an OK scratchpad, but an awesome type inspector :stuck_out_tongue:
U2SR9DL7Q : I never thought to use it for that, but it makes a lot of sense.
U2SR9DL7Q : Elm-mdl has been good but a bit strange at times. I need to try other elm styling libraries and see what I like best.
U635238TG : can someone please give me an eli5 explanation of the Msg type? So it's a type like Int and String, etc right? But it's a special kind of Type or no?
U0J1M0F32 : A `Msg` type is really like any other user defined type within the system, but its one we use in the Elm Architecture to represent the very actions that take place in our application.
U0J1M0F32 : `type Msg = PreviousSlide | NextSlide | NoOp` could be used to represent the various "messages" of a basic slide deck elm app.
U635238TG : user defined like when we make a Type alias using a record?
U0J1M0F32 : like when we use the `type` keyword.
U0J1M0F32 : If I was making a Tic Tac Toe game in Elm I might have a type for Piece:
```
type Piece = X | O | Empty
```

U635238TG : ahhh!
U635238TG : but instead of Piece, sometimes people just say Msg as an Elm common practice?
U0J1M0F32 : Kinda, so in an Elm app that was Tic Tac Toe. I may have that type Piece I just defined, but also have a Msg type like this:
```
type Msg = MakeMove Piece | EndTurn | GameOver | NoOp
```

U0J1M0F32 : but correct, using the word `Msg` is kind of an Elm community standard.
U0J1M0F32 : I remember when it used to be `Action` for awhile.
U635238TG : this tic tac toe example really helped me wrap my head around some of this. thank you. some true eli5 right there! haha
U0J1M0F32 : I've had lots of practice :smile: (Taught at a code school for along time)
U6AU4N1HR : hello, according to this <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-http/3.0.1/Http> theres a url function which can format url with query string, but when i try to use it I get "`Http` does not expose `url`." Any idea why?
U2Q5GJNTB : <@U6AU4N1HR> might be a silly suggestion, but are you sure you you that version of http?
U2Q5GJNTB : os evancz/elm-http an not elm-lang/http ?
U6AU4N1HR : <@U2Q5GJNTB> actualy that's a good question :slightly_smiling_face:
U6AU4N1HR : import Http
