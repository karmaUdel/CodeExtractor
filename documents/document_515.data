yep, correct. but problem is with nested update
so as I thought it should be recursion like a -&gt; b -&gt; insert c to b.children -&gt; b -&gt; a
Imagine that `Tree.map` visits all children recursively, just like `List.map` can do for a list
ok, done :smile:
This discusses `Tree.map` and an implementation for a binary tree <https://evancz.gitbooks.io/functional-programming-in-elm/recursion/binary-trees.html>
&gt; A binary tree is either empty or it is a node with a value and *two subtrees*
yes, either one of which could be empty
Notice that node 9 has two children: 7 and "empty"
hmm, yeah. just read again Insert section and got idea. will try to implement it now for my case :thumbsup:
no, I don't :smile:
bwa?
what is it? I am still not sure how to update it in nested list even on the paper...
will try to draw it step-by step for each foldl callback now
if you want/can post some example code to ellie then there are plenty of *folks* that can help you out
I am going outside right now, but absolutely will post it within next hour, thank you :thumbsup:
*pfft* outside, such a mythical place doesn't actually exist

Hi everyone! Does anyone have a very basic example of searchable. What I mean by searchable  is I have a list of records listed by name and the list shows the results according to what is typed in the box (showing the number of records that match what is entered).
`List.filter (\record -&gt; String.contains (String.toUpper model.searchString) (String.toUpper .name record)) recordList`
This would return a new `recordList` where the `name` contains a substring of `model.searchString`
Just populate `model.searchString` from an `onInput` of the searchbox
<@U5ABF3BH7>  in terms of UI, this is basically an autocomplete control, isn't it?
Yes, I am looking for something similar to elm-searchable-menu, but looking for a straight forward example
<@U5ABF3BH7>: You'd want to store a `recordList` and the `searchString` in your model and then apply the `List.filter ...` line above at some point in your view before displaying the list of records.  If you're familiar with the Elm Architecture, this would really only require a single `Msg` to update the search string in the model
I have one (<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ericgj/elm-autoinput/latest>), I can't make any claims to it being extremely polished though.  Example code here: <https://github.com/ericgj/elm-autoinput/blob/1.0.0/examples/Demo.elm>
Thanks a lot <@U2UGVS24E>  and <@U0JFGGZS6>
What does Attribute Never really mean?
you can't return messages
Anyone tried composing? <https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en-v01/02-elm-arch/06-composing.html>
Hey everyone I'm having an issue importing modules in my project, in my source tree I have a `src` folder with my Main.elm, but I have a `src/Players/Model.elm` does seem to work when I import it with `import Player.Model exposing(..)`
does or does not seem to work with 'import Player.Model'?
is the folder in your elm-projectfile
no it doesn't work
in elm-package.json
<@U5ABF3BH7> here's a super simple example built from scratch <https://ellie-app.com/3zTWfXHQpDwa1/0>
I set my source directories to `"./src"`
What error message you get?
