I keep staring at this and don't see the issue -- am I just blind or is something weird going on?
hmm, I'm not seeing it either...
my initial guess was that Elm didn't like numbers in identifiers (e.g. `week4` as the field in `Model`), but the REPL didn't seem to mind them
ohh the issues is where you are creating the model
record assignment uses `=` not `:`. The colon is used for the type declaration but in the assignment you need to use equals
Oh, :facepalm:
just looking at the wrong line
yep, blind then. Thanks

you are using an int as your elm type but you are encoding it as a string in the json message
.. i dont follow
what do you mean?
should i take these " " away?
yeah, "1" is a string
1 is an int
in json anyway
well number
should i take "" also from date?
no, because those are strings and your decoder is expecting them to be
holy shit
it worked..
and by date a presume you mean aTermin and aDeadl
there you go
i believe that one day, i will be able to use the full potential of coding
:))
thanks to you guys, for making this possible
getting your code types to align with your data types can be one of the more infuriating experiences.
its garunteed to manifest as a runtime error
