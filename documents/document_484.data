U57KYFW67 : <@U663M2MB7> neat. IO is a little bit different in how it's handled, since there's no IO type. Everything gets routed through `Cmd`'s.
U57KYFW67 : <@U663M2MB7> Elm is just like Haskell, where the only points where purity is breached are either buried in native packages or in `Debug.log`
U57KYFW67 : and everything else is side-effect-free
U39DE7RQ9 : <@U48AEBJQ3> thanks, at least now I know where the function resides. I will try to create something using Cmd. Ports only return Cmd right?
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U39DE7RQ9> Yes.
U39DE7RQ9 : <@U48AEBJQ3> is there a Cmd equivalent to Task.attempt?
U48AEBJQ3 : No. What I would do is change all of my `init` functions from something like `init : Session -&gt; Article.Slug -&gt; Task PageLoadError Model` to something like `init : (Result PageLoadError Model -&gt; msg) -&gt; Session -&gt; Article.Slug -&gt; Cmd msg`
U48AEBJQ3 : Which would have you change `transition ArticleLoaded (Article.init model.session slug)` to `transition (Article.init ArticleLoaded model.session slug)`
U48AEBJQ3 : And `transition` would look like:
```
transition cmd =
    { model | pageState = TransitioningFrom (getPage model.pageState) }
        =&gt; cmd
```

U39DE7RQ9 : <@U48AEBJQ3> thanks, I will try that!
U39DE7RQ9 : <@U48AEBJQ3>, now that code seems to compile. The next problem is that in my subscriptions I need to point to messages that resides in my HomePage module. The compiler says:```
23:08:12 client.1   |  The type annotation for `subscriptions` says it always returns:
23:08:12 client.1   |      Sub Msg
23:08:12 client.1   |  But the returned value (shown above) is a:
23:08:12 client.1   |      Sub HomePage.Msg
```

U39DE7RQ9 : I know it is possible to map messages some how but I cant find how.
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U39DE7RQ9> <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Platform-Sub#map>
U48AEBJQ3 : You need something of `HomePage.Msg -&gt; Msg`
U48AEBJQ3 : Usually a constructor of `Msg`
U39DE7RQ9 : <@U48AEBJQ3> a function that encapsulates HomePage.Msg in a Msg?
U48AEBJQ3 : Right, usually a tag of `Msg`
```
type Msg
   ...
   | SubscriptionEvent HomePage.Msg
```

U39DE7RQ9 : Im sorry <@U48AEBJQ3> but I cannot seem to puzzle this out by my self. I have added `SubscriptionEvent HomePage.Msg` message but my subscriptions look like this tight now and it does not compile.```
subscriptions : Model -&gt; Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
    Sub.batch
        [ gotAllPublicForms (SubscriptionEvent (HomePage.GotAllPublicFormsMsg &lt;&lt; decodeValue jsonFormListDecoder))
        , gotForm (SubscriptionEvent (HomePage.GotFormMsg &lt;&lt; decodeValue jsonFormDecoder))
        ]
```

U39DE7RQ9 : My ports look like this:``` 
port getAllPublicForms : () -&gt; Cmd msg
port gotAllPublicForms : (Json.Decode.Value -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg
port getForm : FormId -&gt; Cmd msg
port gotForm : (Json.Decode.Value -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg
```

U39DE7RQ9 : The compiler says:``` 
23:44:13 client.1   |  267|           gotAllPublicForms (SubscriptionEvent (HomePage.GotAllPublicFormsMsg &lt;&lt; decodeValue jsonFormListDecoder)
23:44:13 client.1   |                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
23:44:13 client.1   |  Function `gotAllPublicForms` is expecting the argument to be:
23:44:13 client.1   |      Value -&gt; Msg
23:44:13 client.1   |  But it is:
23:44:13 client.1   |      Msg
```

U48AEBJQ3 : <@U39DE7RQ9> There are different places to tackle this from. I think from how you are doing it here, you need `gotAllPublicForms (SubscriptionEvent &lt;&lt; HomePage.GotAllPublicFormsMsg &lt;&lt; decodeValue jsonFormListDecoder)`
U69D8R59S : Good way to call a function N times? In my specific case, I'm trying to simulate a dice roll by updating my model with random values for a few seconds.
U153UK3FA : <@U69D8R59S> calling a function N times really depends on what you want to do with the N results
U153UK3FA : do you want a list of these results?
U69D8R59S : I want to replace a property on my model N times
U153UK3FA : ah, wanting to animate a die face by having it transition between numbers?
