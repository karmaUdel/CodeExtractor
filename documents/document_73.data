there's a cache for the Longs, but only between -128 and 127, they aren't all cached
identical? isn't just an equality check, it checks if the data is stored in the same location on hardware
when you type in 127, clojure asks for an instance of Long, and java uses a cached set of Longs to look up the value, when you type in 128 clojure once again asks for a Long, but this time java makes a new one
