Congrats and thank you for this nice feature :+1:

We're also on <http://ProductHunt.com|ProductHunt.com> today, we'd love to get your feedback on Memo! (and maybe an up-vote :grin:)
Is distributing the app and submitting to directory, the same thing?
<@U4RLKTQ3W> no - distributing means you're going to implement the OAuth flow rather than the single team app token generation
App directory submission is in the same panel, but not required
Does anyone have advice for where I should start? What editor I should use, if any?
<@U272P5K71> Thanks. Does that mean I can activate the distribution but it wont be publicly available, right?
yep
I'm blanking on the name of a Slack app that lets you overlord a Bot that is say, talking to customers (from within Slack), hand select responses from a tree and even butt-in and take over if you want. Anyone know the one I'm talking about? It's on the tip of my brain-tongue.
<@U3QHKHJNQ> I think you mean <http://dashbot.io|dashbot.io> <@U0DSTH2HL>

Yup! That's us, lmk if you have any questions! 
hmm.. that seems close, but I recall seeing the option to see what the bot was "thinking" in terms of potential answers/bot decision tree
maybe I'm confusing two different apps though
Am I missing something or taking the wrong approach in building a bot that can listen to and respond to multiple teams? Thanks in advance.
Hi folks. I'm subbmitting my app to the app-directory but I can't figure out what this question is about
Ho I have to provide a slack team domain and a USER CREDENTIALS (?!?) with the app already installed? it sounds very wired ( and not very secure)
<@U3XEF6WBZ> "for a *new* Slack team". You can just create a special team dedicated for the App Directory submission.
Obviously don't give them credentials for your own team(s) :wink:
thanks <@U0GT29N3A> still it sounds wired
Hi guys, quick question on botkit - perhaps any of you have solved this. I'm trying to find a way to be configure custom path in the Slack app so that instead of /oauth and /login I can use /my/custom/path/oauth and /my/custom/path/login. But I can't find the options to do this in botkit. Hope there is a stupidly obvious way I'm not considering :slightly_smiling_face:
west: Have you seen the tutorials on Github?
I use the Python client and the tutorials are great to get started.
