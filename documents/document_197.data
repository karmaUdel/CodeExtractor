U19J7PF7T : Got it thanks!
U04SM6T2H : IF you use markdown in one of those fields
U04SM6T2H : you have to tell slack to expect it
U04SM6T2H : there is a mrkdown_in parameter
U19J7PF7T : ```{    "text": "*bold* `code` _italic_ ~strike~",
    "username": "markdownbot",
    "mrkdwn": true
}```

U19J7PF7T : that one? or its another???
U19J7PF7T : :confused:
U04SM6T2H : another one!
U19J7PF7T : ooops
U19J7PF7T : got it
U19J7PF7T : ```"mrkdwn_in": ["text", "pretext"]```
U04SM6T2H : "mrkdwn_in": ["text", "pretext"]
U19J7PF7T : that one?
U04SM6T2H : yup
U04SM6T2H : :slightly_smiling_face:
U19J7PF7T : so i can do bold, italic, etc
U19J7PF7T : but no color
U04SM6T2H : no color
U04SM6T2H : the only color in a slack attachment is the side of the box
U19J7PF7T : great
U19J7PF7T : thanks!
U0HUTFBHS : yeah that's lame.
U0HUTFBHS : IRC has had color since the '90's.  :slightly_smiling_face:
U0GPSB7V1 : on outgoing webhooks from private groups, the name of the group is always “privategroup” ?
U0GPSB7V1 : this seems strange but i guess it sends the group id.
U0GPSB7V1 : meh.
U1F6XAH08 : added an integration to this channel: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/services/B1F79735W|outgoing-webhook>
U1F6XAH08 : testing
U1F6XAH08 : test
U1F6XAH08 : test
U1F6XAH08 : test
U0HUTFBHS : You may want to take that to a testing channel.
U19J7PF7T : i have a question how can i get the id of the team where the bots has been added? so i can send like an onboarding msg?
U19J7PF7T : im trying this
U1F6XAH08 : good idea, sorry about the spam!
U0HUTFBHS : No worries!
U19J7PF7T : ``controller.on('channel_joined',function(bot,message) {        console.log(message);
        //Onboarding Message Here
        //bot.api.chat.postMessage({
        //    text:"hello",
        //    channel: 'aaaand here im lost.'
        //});
    });`

U1F6XAH08 : removed an integration from this channel: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/services/B1F79735W|outgoing-webhook>
U19J7PF7T : ```controller.on('channel_joined',function(bot,message) {       console.log(message);
       //Onboarding Message Here
       //bot.api.chat.postMessage({
       //    text:"hello",
       //    channel: 'aaaand here im lost.'
       //});
   });```

U04S0AG48 : `message.channel.id`
U1F77D0NS : Hey guys, I was just testing my bot and noticed that there's only one URL to post to for slash commands - what has everyone been doing in terms of testing?
U1F77D0NS : I guess I could have it pointed to a server to redirect traffic, and have it go to the server based on channel name/team name. That seems awkward
U19J7PF7T : <@U04S0AG48>:  thanks!
U0HUTFBHS : I test my service in isolation.
U1F77D0NS : <@U0HUTFBHS>: do you mean to setup a second app?
U0HUTFBHS : Well, a slash command sends a request to a service- so I test that service code with a fixture of what I expect from slack.
U1F77D0NS : I see.. what I understand is that there's a single URL to post to, which means that I can't switch from production to a private fixture (like local tunnel) without breaking production
U0HUTFBHS : Oh I see what you're saying.  Yes, that's true.
