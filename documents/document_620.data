The day the pipe structure clicked my life changed forever
also, my update Msgs are way more sane.
same, I wonder how I lived without it
currently trying to sell my team on the benefits of Elm
I'm trying to do the same thing I did here with the calculations for the AI player, but it's trickier
My old boss would never have let me elm if I just asked. But if I'd built something awesome with it first and showed her the no runtime error thing... she'd probably get on board.
I'm building a little thing to show off, it's still early but I have gotten some positive feedback already - we just shipped a React/Redux app and are now planning what will be used in a rewrite of an old flash app
it looks like it will be about the same + TypeScript, but I want to use Elm :smile:
i'm avoiding everything 'script'
typescript, coffeescript, closurescript, javascript...
I used to write python at work, which felt so safe and secure compared to JS... till I met elm.
Is there a way to read response headers with `elm-lang/http`? I'm trying to use an API that uses response headers for pagination <https://docs.gdax.com/#pagination>
<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#Response>
<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#expectStringResponse>
ah, somehow I missed `expectStringResponse`...thanks Noah :slightly_smiling_face:
The name is not so obvious
