yeah, I'm used to the go playground flow
essentially, the user should click start game, and the game board should appear.
in that case you should have some sort of state variable `type State = Pregame | Playing | Results`
Button onclick will eventually do the necessary updates
or something and have the view conditional on that
rather than just an explicit `showBoard: Bool`
game is a `Maybe Game` type so the button triggers to update function that sets up the required state
right so you would use a case instead then
and do a pattern match
I considered case... but I've never used it with a list element... since the only thing changing is one item in the main div's list of Html
