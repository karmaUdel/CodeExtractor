U3YDBDP4Z : Also using Atom, so the elm-format plugin needs to find elm-format
U61V125H6 : Hey, is anyone here working on an Elm in-browser editor or WYSIWYG. Something similar to [stackedit](<https://stackedit.io/editor>). I'm aware of [Dreamwriter](<https://dreamwriter.co/>), but I found simplifying and taking out sections a little tricky. If possible, more of a WYSIWYG library that you can integrate into your elm code
U2M17S85D : Why does the `List` package has the functions `sum` and `product`? They are only working for `numbers`. It seems to me they are unrelated to the package.
U2D7NUGS1 : <@U3YDBDP4Z> if you install it with Brew it should *just work*. First you need to install Brew of course: <https://brew.sh/>
U2D7NUGS1 : Then ```brew install elm elm-format
``` should do the trick.

U3YDBDP4Z : <@U2D7NUGS1> Thanks for that! Now I need to solve the next issue of atom-elm-format not finding the elm-format binary
U2D7NUGS1 : Hmm. I have it working. Let me look at my config.
U2D7NUGS1 : It's probably because there is no executable named `elm-format` anymore. Use `elm-format-0.18`.
U3YDBDP4Z : <@U2D7NUGS1> That did it. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks mate!
U2D7NUGS1 : Cool :slightly_smiling_face:
U2D7NUGS1 : I'll repeat my question from beginners here in hope for a quick answer:How can I handle Error result of `Json.Decode`? I have a snippet like this: ```
, on "opened-changed"
    (Json.Decode.string
        |&gt; <http://Json.Decode.at|Json.Decode.at> [ "detail", "value" ]
        |&gt; Json.Decode.map StringHappened
    )
```
where `StringHappened` is a constructor for my `Msg`. It just so happens that the `detail.value` is a `bool`. Currently in my app nothing happens. I want another variant of `Msg` to be used, say `ErrorHappened`. How can I do it?

U2D7NUGS1 : It's been addressed at <#C192T0Q1E|beginners> .
U37HUSJ4R : Is there an elm version of something like classnames? <https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames>
U4872964V : looks like it would work poorly with Elm’s type system
U1CE9DL9H : what do you want to achieve with it?
U4872964V : Elm-html merges class attributes automatically, if that’s what you want. So you can use multiple class attributes
U37HUSJ4R : ```isActiveFilter : FilterType -&gt; FilterType -&gt; String
 isActiveFilter filterType currentActive =
     if filterType == currentActive then
         "selected"
     else
         ""
```

U37HUSJ4R : and getting used `[ class ("note-change " ++ isActiveFilter System activeFilter)`
U1CE9DL9H : I think you want <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Attributes#classList>
U37HUSJ4R : perfect
U0S6BNVNY : alkstal: I put it in ~/.bin and add that to my path
U0S6BNVNY : alkstal: and if it's in your PATH atom will find it I think (might need a restart, I forget...but you can also tell the plugin where it is explicitly
U3YDBDP4Z : Thanks. I used `brew` to install it, and then I had to specify the name as `elm-format.0.18` instead of `elm-format`
U3R7CKQRX : I have seen it a couple of times for example in <@U0CL0AS3V> 's SPA (<https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Main.elm#L340>) that the `!` operator is not used but `(,)` is aliased as `(=&gt;)` and used to create a pair. Can anybody tell me what the motivation behind that is?
U3SJEDR96 : `=&gt;` is a nice way to express association, or "leads to", or even "with these effects". The `!` bang operator is much less expressive.
U3SJEDR96 : `=&gt;` is also great when working with inline styles or `Dict.fromList` for example
