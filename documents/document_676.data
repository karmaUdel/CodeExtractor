<@U1BP42MRS> Do you know why sometimes they dont get credited even though they were sent? not a big deal just curious - there were a couple that I "received" but last I checked they never got tallied
<@U42LCHFD2> it only works in public channels, if they don't send you may need to `/invite <@U1PS72N20>`
cool thanks

it implies there's a problem with the server, but it could also just be that the package doesn't handle that situation properly. It's unlikely to be your fault
<@U5LNXQHN3> how can I fix it?
That depends on what you mean by fix. If the server is broken and you don't control the server, it's unfixable. If the package just doesn't understand something the server is doing, it's probably possible to patch the package, but that would probably be a job for the package maintainer
the reason being is `str(None)` results in `'None'`, which is a string
open up a python shell
enter in `str(None)`
