U2BS4M1RV : ```help(config)Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;input&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name 'config' is not defined```

Opened the console, type config, and it becomes a link.

U2BS4M1RV : I do have a module in a directory named config, but other modules dont' get that treatment.
U1BP42MRS : If you click the link, does it take you there? Seems like that may be what they are _trying_ to do, and just miss the mark for others?
U2BS4M1RV : Clicking on the link doesn't do anything.
U1BP42MRS : weird ¯\_(?)_/¯
U5NMSURAQ : huh, funny
U2BS4M1RV : In the above, dreamer is the other library, so, idk. Interesting anyway. There is also a config.ini file in the directory.
U1BP42MRS : That is weird, mine doesn't for anything I see in my project

U5NMSURAQ : Sooo, what happens when you DO upload something?
U1BP42MRS : <@U5WNSLTT4> can you please format your code (add three backticks on each side: ` ``` `)
U1BP42MRS : read the intro doc for our standards :slightly_smiling_face:
U5NMSURAQ : oh
U5NMSURAQ : what the..
U2BS4M1RV : Going to run into a loop with these bots competing. :slightly_smiling_face:
U1BP42MRS : haha, looks like we haven't deprecated the slack response
U5WNSLTT4 : <@U5NMSURAQ> everything is up (text data) except images
U5NMSURAQ : did you try to log the variables while you upload an image?
U5NMSURAQ : e. g. at which point the state becomes different from what you expect?
U5WNSLTT4 : I check in admin and there is no any
U5NMSURAQ : what does `upload_images` look like? (log it to console)does the for loop work alright?

U5NMSURAQ : how many times does it iterate, log it too
U5NMSURAQ : I bet you'll find something strange right away if you log

U5WNSLTT4 : I understand your idea, thank you!
U5WNSLTT4 : sorry, ok :slightly_smiling_face:
U1NSCAY6R : One thing you're doing is changing the value of `post.image` each iteration of that loop
U1NSCAY6R : Is it `pass`ing each loop? Do any of those keys exist in `request.files`?
U1NSCAY6R : <@U5WNSLTT4> ^
U28MDQRL2 : you can add those file fields on your form <@U5WNSLTT4>. Then you can pas the `request.FILES` to the form constructor and it handles that for you.
U3G7RJP61 : Anyone know if this is the right shorthand for a one liner? `featured_image=(n == selectedImageIndex)`
U3G7RJP61 : n is from `enumerate` and would be `0` `1` `2`, etc. `selectedImageIndex` would be `1` in this case.
U3G7RJP61 : Python doesn't moan but it doesn't seem to be working
