Can't say I've used Integrant before though. Sorry.
You've given me a direction. Thanks
How can I add java dependencies to my clojure project?
<@U068SUJNT> same way you add clojure dependencies. the project.clj dependencies list is just maven artifacts
okay.
<@U1B0DFD25> you might want to look at Integrant-REPL
Does anyone know of a fuzzy finder lib for Clojure? By fuzzy finding I mean that you can, for example, search for "msd" and it would match, and give a high score to, "my/secret/dir", because the letters appear at word boundaries.
Hi <@U0BKWMG5B>, I was wondering if i could ask you a <#C5K1SHR6X|duct> related question?
<@U4DNSU5NE> <http://yomguithereal.github.io/clj-fuzzy/clojure.html> (and there's also a Java lib: <https://github.com/tdebatty/java-string-similarity> )
<@U0E0XL064> Does that do what I want? All the examples look weird, e.g. `(dice "healed" "sealed") =&gt; 0.8`
<@U4DNSU5NE> oh, I must have misunderstood you. But it looks pretty easy to make it work as you expect: extract the letters at word boundaries and match it against one of the fuzzy string algorithms
Sure, <@U6BEL7FPC> 
so, the only thing to do for you would be: convert `my/secret/dir` to `msd`, right?
<@U0E0XL064> I want some more features, like "msod" would not match "my/secret/dir" but it would match "my/awesome/dir"
But I have now written it myself. :stuck_out_tongue:
oh... that's different, right :slightly_smiling_face:
So, you've written it in less than 3 hours, right? Nice :slightly_smiling_face:
Yes :stuck_out_tongue:
I wonder if you could rip off elisp from one of the emacs helpers that does that and convert it
<@U0E0XL064> <https://ptpb.pw/y1Qw>
Ops, that last one should not have a score of 3 :stuck_out_tongue: I added it manually and did it wrong. :stuck_out_tongue:
I accidentally put s and d next to each other in the string.
got it. :+1:
Anyone have a pointer to a small-to-medium-size, open source codebase that uses `clojure.spec` in the ways that it is typically used?
I expect to have one next week :slightly_smiling_face:. Well, it still needs some work, but the current state is: <https://gitlab.com/kurtosys/lib/factoidic/>
Thanks!
is there a good clojure library for very simple GIS/map data visualization? or am I better off using something like Om with clojurescript?
<https://gitlab.com/kurtosys/lib/factoidic/blob/master/factoidic/src/clj/factoidic/config.clj> - spec for config (will be lib boundary, that's why it's in a separate namespace; other specs might not be in a separate namespace).
3. instrumentation during debugging
may not fit your requirements, but <https://github.com/wiseman/leaflet-gorilla> could be relevant
generative testing code is not in there yet, right?
right, that's one of the reasons why I keep it quiet and it's still in `SNAPSHOT`. I have to add more specs, testing and some benchmarking.
awesome.  Thanks for the link
Okay <@U0BKWMG5B>, right now i'm trying to integrate `buddy`'s authentication middleware with `ataraxy` and `duct`, and looking at the ataraxy module docs, it says that for finer control i should use `duct.router/ataraxy` instead of `duct.module/ataraxy`. I was wondering if there was a way to add other middleware using the `module` instead of `router`?
<@U6BEL7FPC> you can use both. Use the module to create the routes, then add the middleware to the router key.
<@U0BKWMG5B>, oh what would that look like? Would `duct.module/ataraxy` and `duct.router` be keys in the edn file?
Hi, how do I write a response directly in http-kit? I'm building a tunneling proxy and need the very first response to be exactly `"HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established\r\n\r\n",` but it seems http-kit renders that as a *body*, even if I do something like `{:status "HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established"}`
sounds like what you want is to supply a :headers map? but I thought :status would automatically be lifted into the headers
<@U051SS2EU> Oddly, it's not a header, it's a `status-line` in the HTTP spec
