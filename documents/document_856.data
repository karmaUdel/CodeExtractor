U0LSCQQNR : how firm is the requirement that a list test include a sub-list?
U560XSDT3 : yeah
U0LSCQQNR : eg `test_items = [['None'], '', ' ', 'item']`?
U560XSDT3 : Right. In fact, it's looks like `list = [ [item,item1,item3], item, [item4,item5], [None] ] `
U560XSDT3 : So i need to check when there is no value.
U0LSCQQNR : and definition of no value is an empty string
U0LSCQQNR : or a string with just spaces
U0LSCQQNR : or an item of type `None`
U0LSCQQNR : correct?
U5VGKQ2SY : `not val` satisfies `None` and `""`the other two are strings so can be matched like `val not in (' ', 'None')`

U5VGKQ2SY : ```is_empty([None]): False
is_empty(): False
is_empty(None): False
is_empty(['None']): False
```

U560XSDT3 : Thank you! Unfortunately, it doesn't work :disappointed:
U5VGKQ2SY : wait.. so in your code snipet, it's supposed to return F, T, T, F?
U560XSDT3 : I tried to add valid ones.
U560XSDT3 : I'm confused also :smile:
U560XSDT3 : All day working at one task, and finally done 90%, but this thing get me mad :smile:
U5VGKQ2SY : haven't forgotten about you, milo.
U5VGKQ2SY : I think I'm going to get banned for this but the problem is that it needs some way of determining what is being passed (string, or list)
U5VGKQ2SY : so if list, and first element exists and that first element is 'None', then it is empty
U5VGKQ2SY : also, if val does not exist (None or empty), it is also True (is_empty)
U5VGKQ2SY : ```is_empty([None]): True
is_empty(): True
is_empty(None): True
is_empty(['None']): True
is_empty(1): False
```

U560XSDT3 : ?h, man! Thank you soo much! I hope you live near me, so i can buy you a beer or something!! Thanks!
U560XSDT3 : <@U5VGKQ2SY> Please, don't ban him, ban me, i'm a noob :smile:
U5VGKQ2SY : hey, what about `" "` or `[" "]`? &lt;-- spaces
U5VGKQ2SY : As for the alcoholic refreshment, I'm near an airport. Just tell me where to go. :laughing:
U560XSDT3 : Eheheheh :smile: Come to Serbia dude! :smile: 
I will add that option, don't worry :slightly_smiling_face: I was in trouble to determine is list or what :slightly_smiling_face:

U5VGKQ2SY : packing bags yo
U560XSDT3 : <@U5VGKQ2SY> See ya mate!!
U5CRANMFV : Hi all.Can't deal with pandas.
I have six columns 1,2,3,4,5,6
I need to merge into one on 1 and 4, 2 and 5, 3 and 6
How to do it - I do not understand.
```first_column = [df["1"], df["4"]]
second_column = [df["2"], df["5"]]
third_column = [df["3"], df["6"]]
result = pd.concat(first_column, second_column, third_column)```
not working.
Used `append` - did not help.

U65CTNMTR : `pd.concat([first_column, second_column, third_column])` perhaps ?
