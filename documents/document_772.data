U6CAFUBM2 : I have no idea about haskell, I have tried learning it, but just can't wrap my head around it.
U6CAFUBM2 : I would really appreciate, if you could just give me some pointers.
U6CAFUBM2 : I am trying another approach, and it is helping speed up compilation time. I am just flinging it in the blind. let me push new branch.
U6CAFUBM2 : basically I am converting sub messages into commands, this is speeding things up.
U6CAFUBM2 : I have also figured out some stuff about compiler, apart from the fact that "on any modification entire dependent tree is recompiled "
U6CAFUBM2 : there is one more thing, where dependencies are also recompiled, and that is the case with update function. so just splitting up update function doesn't help. The messages have to be decoupled and `Cmd.map`ed so as to avoid recompilation.
U6CAFUBM2 : removing that entire file had no impact on compile time. :disappointed:
U1FFA46TT : when I try to build locally I get```
elm-make: elm-stuff\packages\elm-lang\core\5.1.1\src\Array.elm: getFileStatus: does not exist (No such fi
le or directory)
```

U0CL7EPPG : All good, thanks for letting me know!
U1FFA46TT : ok I got it after deleting the `elm-stuff` folder and reinstalling. after ~1400 lines in the `Data.elm` modules it breaks. It looks really like an issue with `List` creation: if you *split* the list into two sublists it works:
```
conflictList : List Conflict
conflictList =
    headOfConflicts ++ tailOfConflicts


headOfConflicts : List Conflict
headOfConflicts =
    -- from line 14 to line 805

tailOfConflicts : List Conflict
tailOfConflicts =
    -- from line 809 to the end
```

U5WD40ZA9 : I have two pages in a SPA, “Home” and  “Asset”, both of them have the same structure html wise. On Home I render a chart using ports (I give javascript some values and lets the lib insert itself, Elm has with other no idea that the dom is updated). If I then swap to the page with the same structure html wise, Elm is a little bit too smart and doesn’t re-render the html, but instead just change the classes of the divs which means that the chart is displayed on the Asset page. With other words, if I go from Home -&gt; Asset I get this problem. If I go to Asset from any other page I don’t have this problem and I don’t have the problem with any other page getting the chart displayed when I move from Home -&gt; other pages. My current solution is to add a wrapping div around the container where the chart is going to insert itself, this to trick Elm to re-render the html. This seemed like a better solution than using javascript to remove the chart itself when the url changes or something like that. Anyone else had this problem before and have some thoughts on a better solution? I don’t want another poor soul having to debug this issue in the future which is the type of issue that could take 8hrs to understand what is going on. In react I could have done something like “onComponentDidUnmount” to remove the chart when the Home page is swapped. Is there any Elm version of that?
U3SJEDR96 : <@U5WD40ZA9> Elm doesn't like foreign things touching its DOM. So what you'd do in Elm is used `Keyed` nodes so that you can control how the DOM is/can be reused
U2D07QZN3 : hmm- I deleted elm-stuff, and it rebuilt.  I'm using elm 0.18.0.  Still the same problem - IE ok, chrome no
U2D07QZN3 : Does your built version work on chrome?
U2Q5GJNTB : Anybody here that implemented touch or gesture support for small screen in elm? Looks like the packages are either outdated or don't support simple swipe. Any recommendations?
U4SM7ECAG : <@U2Q5GJNTB> I recently reverted to port and zingtouch (<https://github.com/zingchart/zingtouch>)
U4SM7ECAG : which was easier to configure than hammer.js
U2Q5GJNTB : Thanks , I will try that
U25KT36CE : Hey everyone,I am building my first nontrivial Elm SPA (Slack clone), and I've been wondering where to go for resources that could help me. I am particularly confused by complex models&amp;updates, like, how to handle state for separate parts of the app (I am pretty comfortable with smaller apps). Should I use Richard Feldman's real world SPA as an example and work my way through the source or is there some other way to help one build complex apps?
Thank you in advance, have a great day.

U4872964V : <@U25KT36CE> Elm has the model of a single state (source of truth, it’s called) so thinking in terms of handling state for separate parts of the app can easily lead you wrong. Instead try to think about how to pass the relevant pieces of state to the parts of your app that need them (the subfunctions for view and update etc.)
Elm is a functional language, so it’s all about functions, what inputs they take and what result they give.

U25KT36CE : I understand that, but having read some of Richard's SPA source I found that every "page" has its model and update, this is sort of the source of my confusion.
U4872964V : yes, that’s because each page is sort of independent from the other pages, is your app also based on “pages”?
U25KT36CE : So basically each page acts like a separate app?
U4872964V : yes, basically
U25KT36CE : Ah that never crossed my mind
U41NK9BM4 : Is it your case also?
U25KT36CE : I think I willl have 2-3 parts that can be separated
U4872964V : it’s tricky to give general advice because apps don’t all look the same. but starting from the model is always good advice, I think :slightly_smiling_face:
U25KT36CE : Yeah I understand
U25KT36CE : Thank you for the insight
U25KT36CE : I will start with a single model and refactor when necessary
U4872964V : if you look at the elm-spa-example, you can see that the model is a union type for all the pages, basically, so only one page is “active” at the same time
U4872964V : (and some common state, the session)
U25KT36CE : I totally missed that one
U25KT36CE : Gotta read it more carefully
U25KT36CE : Thank you very much
U25KT36CE : This was my first question here, I didn't expect such quick answers
U25KT36CE : So now I have no excuse to postpone coding
U25KT36CE : :grinning: 
U41NK9BM4 : We are fast as lightning. :upside_down_face:
U4872964V : No, you should start coding and not think too much about the structure etc. You can always refactor later. Elm is the best refactoring experience yet
U4872964V : It’s almost impossible to get the structure right from the start anyway, I never do
U25KT36CE : I see
U0H3A9XLN : Is there a way to pattern match list within some tagged type?
U0H3A9XLN : Something like `RemoteData.Success x :: xs`
U3SJEDR96 : Sure
U3SJEDR96 : though that would match if you were matching a list of remotedatas, rather than a remotedata of a list, so you may want `Success ( x :: xs )` instead
U0H3A9XLN : Hm, getting quite weird error```
This tuple is causing problems in this pattern match. - The pattern matches things of type:

    ( a, b, c )

But the values it will actually be trying to match are:

    RemoteData.RemoteData
        Http.Error
        ( List Foo
        , List Bar
        , List Baz
        )
```

U0H3A9XLN : Ah, I see now, nvm
U0H3A9XLN : thanks for help
U41NK9BM4 : Out of curiosity: I see mentioned `WebData` and `RemoteData`. What are the differences? Is one more up-to-date then the other?
U4872964V : `WebData` is just a special case of `RemoteData` for http requests
U4872964V : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/krisajenkins/remotedata/4.3.0/RemoteData#WebData>
U195KCE9X : hi guys, i have a question about mouse subscriptions
U1FFA46TT : I actually tested it with Chrome only :smile:
U1FFA46TT : does it work for you splitting the list into smaller lists?
U60SXAF96 : HOLY CRAP WEBDATA IS AWESOME.
