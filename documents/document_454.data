I'd suggest extracting the common logic to a helper function and calling that from both branches instead of trying to send a `Msg`
fair enough. Is this just not a typical way that a Cmd would be used?
You almost never want to just send Msg to yourself
Msg is meant to represent events from the outside world
No, a `Cmd msg` represents something for the runtime to execute asynchronously, after which it can call your `update` with the resulting `Msg`
ok, that's good to know
thanks!
you don't really need the runtime in order to call a function, though, so using a function to abstract the behaviour of "what should happen when your timer is done" is definitely the recommended approach
