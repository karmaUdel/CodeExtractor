U04SM6T2H : I think that another thing to keep in mind about bots that use the RTM api
U04SM6T2H : Is that it would be easier to have persistent state
U04SM6T2H : the stream is open, its one ongoing process
U04SM6T2H : so it can like, ask a question, wait for the response, and then respond back
U04SM6T2H : instead of trying to connect 2 inbound webhooks or slash commands
U04S09GLN : yeah
U04S09GLN : makes a lot of sense
U04S09GLN : Also, every time you say RTM api, I keep imagining what an RTFM api would be
U04S6E9EW : haha
U04S6E9EW : me too
U04S09GLN : ```GET: /RTFM/v1/&lt;stupid question&gt;RESPONSE: {&lt;snappy answer&gt;}```

U04S6E9EW : ```GET: /RTFM/v1/&lt;stupid question&gt;RESPONSE: <http://lmgtfy.com/?q=&lt;stupid> question&gt;```

U04S6E9EW : How do you format like that?
U04S09GLN : triple ` ticks before and after
U04S09GLN : single \` ticks allow you to `hightlight inline`
U04SS2NBF : I really like the idea of using interactions on messages from integrations to sync to third parties… that's super powerful
U04SS2NBF : Thoughts on whether orgs would feel a bit squeamish about sending every message to a random 3rd party? Do you think these RTM integrations would work better as custom bots that ran on their own servers?
U04S09GLN : <@U04SS2NBF> seems like the logical endpoint of that becomes things like Evernote's  Context system, where related content is automatically associated with what you're doing.
U04S09GLN : A lot of the value would come from behind-the-firewall integrations for us, I'd imagine
U04S09GLN : Like if you mentioned a JIRA ticket, have it automatically link to the JIRA server
U04SS2NBF : Yeah, makes sense.
