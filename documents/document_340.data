There you can see all the possible things that can be updated. So, when `FontSize` is edited, the message comes up like `FontSize 16` or something
So, the payload has the new value
Our situation has a bit of complexity because we used the same editor customizing 3 different types of embeds, so there are general fields and type-specific fields that need to be edited.
i suppose that sending a Msg then means wrapping the FontSize in an FieldInfo and then in another, etc
Yup
