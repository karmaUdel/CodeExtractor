U1U831FNE : <@U1JQ8B5BM>: I've had that problem too and for now just restart the bot every couple of days.
U1DM2B4SY : <@U1JQ8B5BM>: Could also be that it is stuck in a conversation, make sure every branch ends with convo.next().
U1JQ8B5BM : no it is not listening
U1JQ8B5BM : thanks for reply
U1NSE6M3N : Hey guys, is there any way to open active slack app on web and mobile via code? In our slack bot we are showing a payment link to user and once the payment flow completes we want to open the slack app.
U1T9UELH5 : Hi All. Does anyone know if it's possible for a slack app to have access to user profile images? I am trying to create a custom slash command, that when invoked will fetch the user's profile image and do something with it. It seems I'm able to do this by calling Slack's web api, but that requires an OAuth bearer token. I can generate a token for myself during testing, but was wondering if I can get a token when I launch the app that is not tied to any particular user; I'm not building a stand-alone slack client, but introducing new incoming webhooks and slash commands into a team's slack account. Adding a Slack Button (<https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button>) seems to provide an OAuth flow when the app is added to an team's slack account, which also seems to return a OAuth Bearer token. Is this is only way to access the slack web api from a non-user account, e.g., a custom slack app. The other alternative seems to be to create a custom SlackBot, which also gets it's own bearer token which can be used to access the webapi -- however, it's unclear if that bot will have access to user profiles/profile images.
U1BPBKXK5 : Pretty sure the OAuth flow gives your app a token whether you want a bot user or not. Have you tried using the token that comes back in the `access_token` field when you hit the `oauth.access` endpoint?
U1BPBKXK5 : (In any case, we should probably take this to <#C0K8617D5>.)
U1T1QD672 : Hey guys I'm using botkit how do you make the bot put the @user who asked the bot a question in the response? message.user contains some sort of uuid not the username directly
U1T1QD672 : Sorry will move to botkit channel!!
U0TGHKPEU : ```&lt;@user_name&gt;```
U1T1QD672 : Wow should have rtfm 
U1T1QD672 : Thank u <@U0TGHKPEU> 
U1TGELUKE : How do you pretty format the text when you use bot.reply?
U1TGELUKE : If you check on the slackbot message, it's got bold, italic and links and I'd like to know how to do that. Is there some sort of documentation I can read? Thanks.
U1TNJKNCR : how I can update a message from a bot with response_url?
U1TNJKNCR : payload recover in php
U1TNJKNCR : i need your help
U1BPBKXK5 : The response_url just posts new messages in the same channel I think
U1BPBKXK5 : Responses from interaction posts will replace the content of the original message
U1BPBKXK5 : Otherwise, you have to use chat.update
U1TNJKNCR : well,i should use  slack appi or botkit
U1BPBKXK5 : Botkit lets you do this, it has an API helper. `bot.api.chat.update`.
U1TNJKNCR : its a function, true?
U1TNJKNCR : where I find that function?
U1BPBKXK5 : <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.update>
U1BPBKXK5 : There's the API doc
U1TNJKNCR : Thank you
U1BPBKXK5 : np. Good luck!
U1AQ8MY3U : hey guys, I'm tinkering with the interactive buttons trying to add them to my bot - I feel like I must be missing a step, I've registered an app, added my bot user, added a callback url, sending a message as per the docsbut all that seems to appear is the “text” of the message (not the attached buttons)

U1AQ8MY3U : is there some subtle step I'm missing - I feel like i've read over the docs a hundred times :smile:
U1HK4CCRM : <@U1AQ8MY3U> have you tested your json in the message builder?
U1AQ8MY3U : yup! it works there
U1AQ8MY3U : <https://api.slack.com/docs/messages/builder?msg=%7B%22attachments%22%3A%5B%7B%22actions%22%3A%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22Button%201%22%2C%22style%22%3A%22default%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Text%201%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22button%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22value1%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22Button%202%22%2C%22style%22%3A%22primary%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Text%202%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22button%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22value2%22%7D%2C%7B%22confirm%22%3A%7B%22dismiss_text%22%3A%22dismiss%22%2C%22ok_text%22%3A%22ok%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Text%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22Title%22%7D%2C%22name%22%3A%22Button%203%22%2C%22style%22%3A%22danger%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Text%203%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22button%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22value3%22%7D%5D%2C%22attachment_type%22%3A%22default%22%2C%22callback_id%22%3A%22703699%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22danger%22%2C%22fallback%22%3A%22this%20is%20the%20text%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22this%20is%20the%20text%22%7D%5D%7D>
U1AQ8MY3U : ugh heh
U1HK4CCRM : are you using botkit?
U1AQ8MY3U : no, my own bot
U1HK4CCRM : gotcha. Are you encoding your attachments?
U1AQ8MY3U : let me double check
U1AQ8MY3U : (i'm not receiving any api error responses though)
U1AQ8MY3U : brb
U1HK4CCRM : It wouldn't return an error. It would just ignore that property
U1AQ8MY3U : ah ok
U1HK4CCRM : &gt; The optional attachments argument should contain a JSON-encoded array of attachments.
U1HK4CCRM : <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage>
U1AQ8MY3U : quick extra question while I grab some more details..
U1AQ8MY3U : if I send `{"channel":"C1E6M4WUW","text":"hello”}` to `chat.postMessage` as a GET it works
U1AQ8MY3U : as a POST it fails with `channel_not_found`
U1HK4CCRM : POST doesn't take JSON right now
U1AQ8MY3U : oh ok
U1AQ8MY3U : bugger :smile:
U1AQ8MY3U : ok cool, perhaps this is related then - I think the attachments are being sent as json - let me change this up so they are encoded GET params
U1AQ8MY3U : sounds like that'll be the fix!
U1AQ8MY3U : what should the query param be?
U1AQ8MY3U : I didn't see it in the docs
U1AQ8MY3U : ie `<http://api.foo/path?&lt;what_goes_here&gt;=encodedJson>`
U1AQ8MY3U : :facepalm: nvm - I know what I was doing wrong
U1AQ8MY3U : I was too caught up in thinking in terms of json since thats how everything is represented in the docs
U1AQ8MY3U : all good now! - thanks for the push in the right direction <@U1HK4CCRM>
U1AQ8MY3U : next problem :stuck_out_tongue: - I don't seem to be getting a response from button taps :confused:
U1KH878SJ : <@U1AQ8MY3U>: it does take JSON but you have to specify the correct `Content-Type` headers
U1KH878SJ : for POST`ing` to `chat.postMessage`
U1AQ8MY3U : yup, I was specifying `Content-Type: application/json`
U1AQ8MY3U : but it wasn't working for some reason :confused:
U1AQ8MY3U : I managed to get the buttons to show using encoded params
U1AQ8MY3U : but when I tap them my https url isn't getting hit
U1AQ8MY3U : I can see the initial test from slack is working when I setup the url in the config
U1AQ8MY3U : but the button taps themselves aren't :disappointed:
U1AQ8MY3U : I can't use the regular bot auth (bot token) if I want to use interactive buttons?
U1AQ8MY3U : I have to use oauth ?
U1AQ8MY3U : hmm no, seems regular bot user is ok
U1AQ8MY3U : I wish there was a way to debug this stuff… I'm kinda stuck :confused:
U0HT1NBLH : were the messages with buttons sent from your app? See #1 here: <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-buttons>
U1AQ8MY3U : yeah
U1AQ8MY3U : so I can make my bot (which is wrapped in an app) display buttons
U1AQ8MY3U : but tapping them does nothing
U1AQ8MY3U : I can only assume I've not configured something properly
U1AQ8MY3U : which is why I asked about the auth method :confused:
U1AQ8MY3U : currently I'm using the bot user token - I suspected that I might need to change it to use oauth instead - but I can't find any docs that specify that
U0HT1NBLH : Yep, I think it has to be coming from a Slack App that a user has authed over OAuth
U1AQ8MY3U : is there a way to do that without user interaction ?
U1AQ8MY3U : I know what oauth is from a user standpoint - but I've never really needed to interact with it from a development standpoint
U0HT1NBLH : Nope, you need user interaction to confirm the auth. The docs have a pretty good overview of how the process works for Slack: <https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth>
U0HT1NBLH : the easiest way to get in to the flow is using the Add to Slack or Sign in with Slack buttons, which will hit your apps provided oauth url
U1AQ8MY3U : fair enough - I'll try again :smile:
U1AQ8MY3U : thanks!
U0HT1NBLH : np - here's my first pass at it (uses Foundation, but the idea is the same) :slightly_smiling_face:<https://github.com/pvzig/SlackKit/blob/master/SlackKit/Sources/OAuthServer.swift>
U1AQ8MY3U : cool, cheers :smile:
U1LLB1709 : I'm running into a frequent problem with response times. (I'm still a rookie at this in general.) I'm using Google Apps Script as my platform (essentially server side javascript) so response times aren't fantastic. Nearly every command/button that is sent triggers `Timeout was reached` even when it takes just barely too long to reply. The Slack API talks about sending an HTTP 200 "OK" status code to prevent a user facing error. Can anyone point me in the right direction on how to accomplish this with a stripped down version of js? I can't include any external libraries unless they're hosted w/in GAS.
U1UL0T6RY : Hi,How can I add 2nd level authorization before user posts message to any channel using webhook url?

Manish

U1UL0T6RY : from what I looks like, once I have a webhook URL , i can just curl post to any channel
U1UL0T6RY : :flushed:
U0LKH699P : can slack APi send notes or a snippet ?
U0LKH699P : i remember some talk about that a while back
U0LKH699P : maybe just editing an existing note or sthing?
U1P3Q8JKV : _i think_ the only way to limit the webhook's destination channel is to bundle it into an app. The app doesn't need to be published.
U1P3Q8JKV : <@U0LKH699P> if you use web api to upload a file to a channel, that can create a snippet.
U1UL0T6RY : Thanks <@U1P3Q8JKV>
U0LKH699P : <@U1P3Q8JKV>: thanks, will try that
U1QB7RXQQ : HIi
U1QB7RXQQ : is there a possible way to get file that uploaded in slack from user to post it to my api through bot?
U1USFAQ6S : When I send a message with the web chat.postMessage API and include attachments (with action buttons), things work great. But, when I send the same type of message (with same formatting) in response to a slash command to the response_url, the attachment is ignored.  Anyone know if attachments are not supported in response to a slack command or button click?
U0HUTFBHS : weird dharmesh, the docs say that should work.
U1USFAQ6S : No worries.  Not a huge deal -- it's likely going to end up being something silly that I'm doing wrong.
U0HUTFBHS : I haven't tried the message buttons yet, gotta get on that.  :slightly_smiling_face:
U1HK4CCRM : <@U1USFAQ6S> are you posting form-data or JSON to the response_url?
U1USFAQ6S : <@U1HK4CCRM>: I'm posting JSON data to the response_url.  But, oddly, the attachments "element" in the JSON needs to be a string (even though it's JSON).  At least, that's what I think, and it's the only way I got attachments to work at all -- even with the regular chat.postMessage.
U1HK4CCRM : <@U1USFAQ6S>: I'm not so sure that attachments needs to be a string if you're posting with `application/json`
U0HUTFBHS : When you say element, do you mean key, or value?
U1V00QLG0 : /app_report 
U1V00QLG0 : Hi bot developers
U1V00QLG0 : sorry for my ignorance, but I am totally new into this bot world :slightly_smiling_face:
U1V00QLG0 : are making slack bots profitable?
U0YHRDB3Q : <@U1V00QLG0>: if I'm not mistaken, Slack doesn't have a monetization system for bots yet
U0YHRDB3Q : BUT
U1BPBKXK5 : Not sure anyone has a proven business model yet
U1BPBKXK5 : But lots of ideas, some of which _seem_ tenable
U0YHRDB3Q : you can offer paid tiers of your service, but I'm no business expert
U1V00QLG0 : <@U0YHRDB3Q>, yes, I would like to create bot and charge per user by making external service in addition to bot (seems like lots of bot developers are doing like this)
U1V00QLG0 : <@U1BPBKXK5>: seems like there are bots charging money for usage, I made some other apps for other platforms, now interested in trying slack
U0HBN0L9M : <@U1V00QLG0>: what is interesting with Slack is that you build for businesses
U0HBN0L9M : so you can defend charging because you create measurable value
U0HBN0L9M : versus BtC bots... much harder
U0YHRDB3Q : tbh the reason the place I'm working at is letting me screw around with <#C0AV5N8NA> so much is because they find value in having everything in one place
U0YHRDB3Q : Hubstaff reports, Trello cards, etc
U0YHRDB3Q : it just saves time
U1V00QLG0 : I just started reading integration docs and it feels crappy (sorry slack team)why is the slash commands and bot users are different thing?

can I create bot which has slash commands integrated, so that user who is integrating it to their team do not need to fill forms, webhooks and so on?

U1V00QLG0 : so far I am having difficult times to understand their writing style
U0YHRDB3Q : <@U1V00QLG0>: let <#C0AV5N8NA> into your life <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit>
U0YHRDB3Q : it has both Bot User capabilities and Slash commands built in
U1V00QLG0 : thanks <@U0YHRDB3Q> :+1:
U0HUTFBHS : I like that slash command are separate.
U0HUTFBHS : It's a lot simpler to develop and easier to scale than a bot user.
U0LKH699P : any suggestions for a html/css front end framework or libraries for a bot?
I have a slack bot but want to build a limited way for users to chat to it via the web. but building out a nice bubbles chat UI that feels good is a lot of work.

U0LKH699P : anyone know github projects that are built for this?
U0LKH699P : something like an open-source version of olark but just the client part. to add to another website so ideally not bogged down with angular or react etc.
U0LLUCLP3 : To clarify I used a crude design example to exaggerate the concept.Slack Group Admin. will be able to put up time for different countries or time zone regions as the Slack Group needs.
Slack is Global as we all know so this diverse combination of different nationalities is an excellent place for "Slack Customizable International Time Display."

U0HBN0L9M : <@U1V00QLG0>: slash commands or webhooks are simple apps. Bots are complex, powerful apps
U0HBN0L9M : basically you're asking "why the powerful app can't integrate the simple app". It can :slightly_smiling_face:
U1NF8G401 : anyone have a better method for building a link to a message in the archives than something like this: `var link = 'https://'+payload.team.domain+'.<http://slack.com/archives/'+payload.channel.name+'/p'+parseInt((parseFloat(payload.message_ts)*1000000));|slack.com/archives/'+payload.channel.name+'/p'+parseInt((parseFloat(payload.message_ts)*1000000));>`
U1V80FSKB : Hi all! Seeing some interesting Slack API behavior and was wondering if this was normal: it seems that when a bot is added to a team, an IM session is automatically created between the bot and every user. I thought that an IM session had to be created manually either by a user interacting with my bot or by my bot via `im.open`.
U1DM2B4SY : using botkit or something else?
U1DM2B4SY : or bots taken from the app directory?
U1V80FSKB : Using my own home grown client.
U1V80FSKB : Moving this :question: over to <#C0K8617D5>. :slightly_smiling_face:
U1TNJKNCR : in botkit
U1TNJKNCR : what function, i can use chat update
U113YKYHF : Is there a slack meetup in Santa Monica or the Westside of LA?
U1MP10YR0 : <@U1TNJKNCR>: You can use bot.api.chat.update to update previous sent messages.
U0LKH699P : <@U113YKYHF>: if there isn't you could start one, I did that in SF and overnight we had ~100 people interested. and that was *before* the current hypopalooza.
U113YKYHF : <@U0LKH699P>: Good point! Thanks for the perspective.
U0C2RGP4P : Just wanted to let you all know that Talla, which is based in Boston, just opened an office in San Fran with 1 FTE.  More soon.  We would love to connect in person with any of you who are local to either location
U1TNJKNCR : I can update a postMessage of a bot?
U1TNJKNCR : use botkit
U1TNJKNCR : i try update a postMessage with slack-api-master in php
U1VLZ6FK9 : Hi, I'm sure this is a really common question, but what's the best method for a botkit bot to start a conversation without an incoming message?
U1VLZ6FK9 : I was going to use bot.say() and then add a controller.hears to listen for a few options before starting the conversation but that seemed a strange approach...
U04SM6T2H : <@U1VLZ6FK9>: join us in <#C0AV5N8NA> to discuss
U1VLZ6FK9 : ah sorry
U04SM6T2H : no worries
U1TMT1R1C : Hi!, i've a question about responses to a "interactive button message", after read and read and your help, i could get my bot working. But now, im trying to send a response back to the action buttons that the user clicked. But im getting this message: 
(
   [ok] =&gt; 
   [error] =&gt; message_not_found
)

And i cant send any response 'cause that is the Slack response.

Im using php and the "chatUpdate" method in slack api. Can you help me please?

U1TMT1R1C : Or there's another way to send a message to change the past message from "Request URL" configured before in my app?
U0HUNC8PR : i am not sure if i understand you ..but just to understand more are you sending ` replace_original` as True or False
U1TMT1R1C : Amm, sorry if my question isnt clear, well, i was trying to update the message with 'call('chat.update')' from slack api, but, slack sent me an error (message_not_found), of course I used the api tester in the page to send the new message, but... in the response of the test, the page sent me the same error. All the fields were filled correctly but the same error. Or where i've to use 'replace_original'
U1TMT1R1C : The original message was sent from a bot, im trying to update it from php using the 'payload' to get the token and other information like TS, etc. It's that possible or i've to send my new message from my JS file using bot.replyInteractive?
U1VTY2EJE : hello i am junior developer
U1VTY2EJE : wanted to integrate stack for my site via add to slack button
U1VTY2EJE : i need to test in on my local machine ?
U1VTY2EJE : anybody would help me
U0KECURAT : <@U1VTY2EJE>: you can use ngrok, localtunnel if you need ssl or you can add an entry in your host file to set a custom domain for your test app as redirect uris
U1VTY2EJE : i m using this
U1VTY2EJE : now i wana test my custom command of app
U1VTY2EJE : and one more thing i also want to know about one this is user_id is enoughf to identified that user already installed app?
U1VLZ6FK9 : Can bots @mention users?
U0563E81H : <@U1VLZ6FK9> - you can send &lt;@U12341234&gt; to mention a user by his ID
U1VLZ6FK9 : ah great, thanks
U1VLZ6FK9 : inclusive of &lt;&gt;?
U0KECURAT : <@U1VLZ6FK9>: yes
U1VLZ6FK9 : great, thanks
U1NSE6M3N : Hey Guys, We are facing issue in implementing Slash Commands. Below is the format of our command:
Format: /send @receiver gift

In slash commands, we are getting receiver's username instead of receiver's slack id. But in other normal messages, whenever someone mentions a @username we always get user's slack id instead of username. Is it possible to get receiver's slack id in case of slash commands or Is there any way to get user's slack id from username?

U0TGHKPEU : <@U1NSE6M3N>: if you are not storing list of users from the team to your local storage , you can try using <https://api.slack.com/methods/users.info> , how ever this may delay the response of your slash command , although you can use the response_url of the slash command if that would happen
U1TMT1R1C : Hi!, A little question. Im using an app from slack (i created it), to use interactive messages i created a bot inside that app and using Howdy's botkit i can send messages. My bot is able to post messages with buttons, but i cant give a "interactive response" or a chat update.I've my URL configured in the app and imt trying to send a response with php, but... well, i get this error: [ok] =&gt; 
 [error] =&gt; message_not_found.

Now, i changed the way to response that messages and i decided to use Botkit and "replyInteractive" method to send a new message, but... My buttons still not working. Someone can give a hand with that please? :pensive:

Im trying to use this method, but i cant receive the callback or the data that this method requires
<https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/readme-slack.md#receive-an-interactive-message-callback>

U1TMT1R1C : If it's necessary, i can send you the code (file where im working) :slightly_smiling_face:
U14TYLC94 : Cool read about Chatbots from the team at Orange: <http://osvproduct.com/howcanihelp/>
U0LKH699P : i went to that event last night <@U14TYLC94>
U0LKH699P : Cool read, "if i say so myself" lol :slightly_smiling_face:
U14TYLC94 : :slightly_smiling_face:
U0LKH699P : its a big deal the CEO of orange presented there
U14TYLC94 : yeah it was cool. We are going to upload the vide ofo rthe folks that could not make it. I'll post the link
U0LKH699P : there's a <#C0HK02UNN> also fyi
U1WGDEYNA : Hey! :slightly_smiling_face:
U1WGDEYNA : How do I change a bot's 'appearance'
U1WGDEYNA : So lets say I want to change its first_name / last_name and make the icon :robot_face:
U0C2RGP4P : Is there a way to mention a username and not have them get notified by slack?  If not, I'd love to see Slack implement some kind of tag such that a bot could insert a sentence into a public channel like "Yes, &lt;special tag&gt; John Smith&lt;/special tag&gt; is working on that."  John Smith doesn't need to be notified that he was just mentioned, as the mention was informational, not directed to him.
U0LKH699P : <@U0C2RGP4P>: why cant you just put the name in *bold* ?
U0C2RGP4P : I think that still triggers a notification 
U1AQ8MY3U : by default you only get a notification for @yourname (@ needs to be present)
U1AQ8MY3U : oh nope
U1AQ8MY3U : im a big fat liar :stuck_out_tongue:
U1AQ8MY3U : @yourname and yourname do trigger notifications
U1AQ8MY3U : :zipper_mouth_face:
U0LR6R73K : I thought bots didn't trigger notifications unless `@` is used. They definitely don't trigger notifications for highlighted words.
U0LR6R73K : Tested and no notification from bot where username is mentioned without @ tag.
U1MQMDL8L : Anyone ever seen setInterval not respect your millisecond setting properly? I have it set to 5 minutes and sometimes it posts at 1 minute, sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes 3. Very weird.
U1RQECA1H : Where are you using it? NodeJS?
U1MQMDL8L : Yeah. I think I figured out the issue though. One of my clearInterval seems to have silently failed, so it was double pushing.
U0C2RGP4P : <@U0LR6R73K>: I get a different result.  What do you mean by "notification"?  I get the same thing if my name is mentioned with or without @
U0C2RGP4P : <@U0LR6R73K>: and it would still be nice to have a tag that would allow me to use @name without notifying them.  Sometimes I just want to reference a person for someone else
U0LR6R73K : It might be to do with team wide settings, actually. See <http://your_team.slack.com/admin/settings#require_at_for_mention|your_team.slack.com/admin/settings#require_at_for_mention>
U0LR6R73K : <@U0C2RGP4P>: 
U0LR6R73K : Sorry, that may be why I have different results
U0HERRQR1 : <@U1MQMDL8L>: setinterval is based on your clock cycle
U0HERRQR1 : so it's not persistent
U0C2RGP4P : <@U0LR6R73K>: ah cool.  Thx
U1MQMDL8L : I found the issue. It was because a clearInterval didn't clear properly. But thanks <@U0HERRQR1>
U1TMT1R1C : Hi!, Good night.I built my bot and now is ready to start the work. Now i have a big question. How can i install it in a server?

U1TMT1R1C : How can i leave it working all the day, i was reading that it disconects after few time
U16USBQBH : Does anyone have a good solution for custom user subdomains? Using MEAN stack.
U1X28AW6S : Anyone know why I am getting an "Received slash command, but could not load team" error when launching a slack command app using vscode json debugger? Works fine manually starting it through node cli
U1SSQQ02U : <@U1TMT1R1C> try heroku
U0KECURAT : <@U16USBQBH>: dynamic subdomains is not the most pleasant thing to do in express, although doable I'd prefer to leave that up to a reverse proxy like nginx if you're using that :slightly_smiling_face:
U1TMT1R1C : <@U1SSQQ02U> I'll read about it, but you can provide me some pages with concrete information, please?
U1SSQQ02U : <https://blog.heroku.com/how-to-deploy-your-slack-bots-to-heroku>
U1SSQQ02U : <@U1TMT1R1C>:
U1TMT1R1C : Thanks :)
U1TMT1R1C : Ok, my team puts the bot in the server and they starts to work with it using node ----.js in the console. But the Bot disconnects the RTM Api, how can we get the bot working all the time
U1TMT1R1C : ?
U1MQMDL8L : If you're on the free Heroku plan, the server sleeps 8 hours a day. If you want to stay active, you need a paid plan with Heroku.
U0D1YNBEE : <@U1TMT1R1C>: you should also try Beep Boop :wink: <https://beepboophq.com/>
U1UB04YR4 : <@U0D1YNBEE> I havent seen this yet, it might change my life :ok_hand:
U0D1YNBEE : I hope so :slightly_smiling_face:
U1TMT1R1C : <@U0D1YNBEE>: But if my bot isn't a custom bot?, its integrated with an app in my team. I use it to send interactive messages. I follow the Howdy Botkit to build it. (To start the bot i use clientID, secretID and a port)
U0D1YNBEE : On Beep Boop we handle the whole oauth flow for you, would be tricky to port an existing app over. Beep Boop works best if your bot is a Slack App (like you're using) rather than just a custom integration token
U07CW6N3A : Hello everyone!
Today the Slack platform team released the Events API, a way for your Slack apps to subscribe to specific team events and have them pushed to your server. :lightning:

:mag_right:  Focus just on the event types you need and don't worry about maintaining open websocket connections for every team or user you work with.  :four_leaf_clover:

&gt; Our announcement covers some of the typical use cases: <https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/subscribe-to-the-events-api-d7120470983f#.u9n3rc58x>

&gt; The documentation walks you through configuration and processing events: <https://api.slack.com/events-api>

&gt; Browse the available event types: <https://api.slack.com/events/api>

We're excited to see what you build with the Events API! When used in conjunction with the Web API, it's possible to build (&amp; scale) bot users entirely over HTTP.

U0LKH699P : i like that demo. slack is turning into a platform for realtime apps...
U0LKH699P : be interesting to see how buttons and forms develop
U0LKH699P : i thought the "updating a message after its been sent" is a cool feature but worried it was a hack that might get closed off. if you're using it for slackbot demos then it feels safer to use :slightly_smiling_face:
U0JPS3SHX : my question is, if we can use the events to avoid the RTM API, is there a way to make the bot “available” without doing the connection ?
U1TMT1R1C : <@U0D1YNBEE>: Ok i think that i followed all the steps, now i heve to upload my project to the github repository, Where i have to put all the files and what files i've to put in the repo?. I use Mysql in node
U1AQ8MY3U : if you subscribe to the ‘message' event aren't you just gonna get bombarded with ‘pushes' ?
U1AQ8MY3U : I assume this is an alternative to a ‘bot' in which a constant web socket connection is over kill
U1AQ8MY3U : I don't think this provides anything over and above the RTM api - it seems to just be 2 ways to achieve the same end?
U0JPS3SHX : +1 <@U1AQ8MY3U> maybe I am missing something but looks like that, I was expecting more events around bot mentions for example, or direct messages to the bot, etc
U1AQ8MY3U : I don't think having 2 ways to achieve the same thing is a bad thing though. sometimes a websocket _is_ over kill - like in the example interaction they are showing
U1AQ8MY3U : but yep, I'd also be happy to see them expanding the events each of those apis get
U1AQ8MY3U : my _preference_ would be that they introduce some consistency into the existing api first though :stuck_out_tongue:
U0CNYC404 : Awesome, was looking forward to this coming out :slightly_smiling_face:
U0JPS3SHX : the slash command, button payload and now the event payload are all similar but quite different
U0D1YNBEE : :wave: today we released a new node library called <#C1XFTGV55> for creating Slack Apps that's designed specifically for using the Events API <https://blog.beepboophq.com/slapp-a-new-library-for-slack-apps-13a6e91b6bf#.qtc5a35c6>
U0JPS3SHX : slash command:user_id: ‘12312'
button pressend:
user.id: ‘121212”
event payload:
user: ‘1231231'

U1AQ8MY3U : lol
U1AQ8MY3U : :upside_down_face:
U1AQ8MY3U : sounds like their teams need an internal style guide or something ?
U1UB04YR4 : <@U0JPS3SHX> reminds me of CSS rules :stuck_out_tongue:
U1UB04YR4 : exampleStyle: nonesomeOtherThing: 0
yetAnotherThing: no-thing

U0JPS3SHX : lol exactly
U0JPS3SHX : maybe they are different teams, but the funny thing is when i saw in the button pressed payload `user: { id: ‘1212' }` I though that was a good move and that would be the way moving forward … but now a new style is in town
U07CW6N3A : We're definitely cognizant of the inconsistencies between API types in the platform. Some of them are trickier than others when honoring historical choices. In the Events API, for example, we're bound by the existing structure of events sent in the RTM API, though we have the luxury of "wrapping" those existing event types with additional, more modern metadata, we also erred on the side of being non-duplicative.
U07CW6N3A : The way of addressing user IDs in message buttons is definitely a more modern approach that we can't easily backport to slash commands and event payloads in a non-breaking and non-duplicative way, though we'd definitely prefer consistency across features.
U04TLHGSC : <@U07CW6N3A> thanks for the update
U0JPS3SHX : no problem <@U07CW6N3A> thanks for the details :slightly_smiling_face:
U1S2K009M : <@U1TMT1R1C>: I have a bot similar to yours. I have the following setup: Bot code in open source (<https://github.com/prongs/lens-slack-bot>). The bot reads token and some more details from a config file. Now, I have installed that in one of the server machines. With two helper files: 

```
lens@server-machine:/usr/local/lens/bot$ cat lensbot.js
var LensSlackBot = require("lens-slack-bot");
var bot = new LensSlackBot();
bot.start();
lens@server-machine:/usr/local/lens/bot$ cat startbot.sh
while true; do
rm -rf /tmp/npm-*
npm install git+<https://github.com/prongs/lens-node-client.git>
npm install git+<https://github.com/prongs/lens-slack-bot.git>
ps -ef | grep node | grep lensbot | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -L1 kill -9
node lensbot.js;
sleep 60;
done &amp;
lens@server-machine:/usr/local/lens/bot$```

This makes sure the bot is always up. The 60 second interval can be reduced as per the requirement. Turns out, this bot stays up for days and the 60 second downtime occurs once a week or so. I have the following in the app's code that might be resulting in such a behaviour: 

```controller.on('tick', () =&gt; {
      const now = new Date();
      if (now.getTime() - this.lastActiveTime.getTime() &gt; 1000 * 60) { // 1 minute idle timeout
        this.bot.say({type: "ping", id: now.getTime()}, this.updateLastActiveTime);
      }
    });```

With these two mechanisms, I'm able to keep my bot up practically indefinitely.

U1NSE6M3N : Hey guys, is it possible to change color of optional text with attachment and make it bold
"attachments": [
       {
           "fallback": "Required plain-text summary of the attachment.",
           "color": "#36a64f ",
            "text": "Optional text that appears within the attachment"
        
        }
    ]

U0HT1NBLH : you can bold it using markdown (see docs here under the header “Message Formatting": <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting#message_formatting>) but I don't think it's possible to change the color
U0KECURAT : he was missing the `”mrkdwn”: true` part :slightly_smiling_face:
U1JQ8B5BM : hello i want to integrate interactive messages buttons but when i click on button salkbot says "Oh no, something went wrong. Please try that again."
U1JQ8B5BM : does any one have a solution to this
U1JQ8B5BM : what i have to do to get postback from interactive buttons
U1116QM2Q : <@U1JQ8B5BM>: are u using botkit? 
if you're using botkit and use the internal function that it has to set up the interactive endpoints then you need to go to your slack app profile, go to interactive messages tab and post the endpoint as `<https://your-hosting-service-here/slack/receive>` as the botkit routes the interactive messages postbacks to that endpoint

U1JQ8B5BM : yes
U1JQ8B5BM : can you tell me the procedure what i have to do.do i have to create slack app first. then i can use interactive messages buttons
