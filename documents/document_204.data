hi can someone help me sending a message ,with messagae-buttons using python/
Guys how to implement "Sign in with Slack" and "Add to slack" with bot kit. Looks like Botkit only takes one set of scopes.

hi guys this is kingshuk
i need help in one issue
i am getting duplicate responses from messenger bot
<@U0V93GE5R> are you here ? :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U5SS5GK36> you didn't ask anything.....
<@U5SS5GK36> we are always here :smile:
I posted an issue on the github of botkit :slightly_smiling_face:
I know that I can use bot.api.chat.update(...) but I need timestamp, so how to get the message info from the bot reply ?"
<@U04S3JCH2> <@U1DM2B4SY> <@U0V93GE5R> :slightly_smiling_face:
(botkit)
<@U5SS5GK36> caught up with work right now but you should scan the <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> channel and post your question in there :thumbsup:
Hey all! Looking for some help and can't find anything online. I want to use api/files.upload to upload a file to our team channel and having issues with the multipart/form-data request. If anyone has any experience with this please send me a message or let me know.
I do not know that a botkit channel existed
thanks ! :slightly_smiling_face:
Hey guys! I'm the Founder and CEO of StdLib, I've been here for a bit and tracked some convos. We launched a really easy way to build Slack bots a couple months ago.
I just wanted to share our most recent stuff, you can build a basic Twilio Bot + Call Forwarder in 7 minutes with no infrastructure setup required :slightly_smiling_face:

Is it possible to disable interactive message buttons for certain users?
Hi, I've imported the botkit-starter-ciscospark to glitch. I've added the access_token and the public_address in the env file. I got the public_address from ngrok which is running on local machine. There are no errors on glitch. I see `POST /ciscospark/receive 502 Bad Gateway` on ngrok window. What am I missing? The bot is not replying to "hello".
did you add the secret to the .env file?
its a random string you make up
fwiw we also have <#C2DR1AJD7|cisco_spark> here
Hi guys, has anyone built a bot on the Microsoft Bot Framework, ideally connected to Skype for Business or Facebook @ Workplace?
<@U0V93GE5R> Yes. On glitch, I'm using the access_token which I used in a non-botkit bot which I ran on my local machine following a cisco learning labs lab. That bot is now offline. Should I use the access_token of a newly created bot?
yes, and you ALSO need to create a secret token
i think you can reuse that old token
mgtheboss: you might want to  regenerate the token or create a new app in the cisco developer portal if you are unsure if the old one still works
I also see 3 errors, `'matches' is not defined` in `skills/help.js`.
thats unrelated to the token issue
  type: 'bot' }`. The emails and displayName fields contain correct values. Is token really the issue?
I tested with a new access_token. It didn't work. I removed and readded the bot in cisco spark. The two actions generated two more `502 Bad Gateway` errors in ngrok.
I tested with a new bot's access_token. It didn't work. I got `502 Bad Gateway` error when I added the new bot in cisco spark.
hey
how to use delayed response with botkit?
need for slash command
And you entered the access token AND added the secret token that you made up?
<https://lighthousebot.com>
<@U5U969G1G> congrats and everything, but if you could please keep announcements like this in <#C0JQ4TX7Z|announcements>
we'd appreciate it!
benbrown: sure will do next time thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
Yes. In addition to during addition and removal of the bot, I am also getting the bad gateway message when doing @botname hello or @botname help.
Do I need to put the strings in double quotes in the env file?
Hi mgtheboss:  i hope you have solved your issue :slightly_smiling_face: , but, in view of the technical nature of the issue, I would say it's worth to take a look on <https://machinabot.com> , let me know what you think...
The error encountered was: dial tcp [::1]:8080: connectex: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.
Using `ngrok http 3000` instead of `ngrok http 80` seems to have taken care of the tunneling issue but, the bot is still not replying. I'm not getting the bad gateway messages anymore.
It seems I have solved the last piece of the puzzle. I was not providing the secret while creating the webhooks. I've got the welcome message, "I am a bot, here to do your bidding." I would like to know why it was not working with port 80. The `node-sparkbot-samples` from learning labs ran perfectly with port 80.
Hello, I have installed and am using the botkit-starter-slack, everything is up and running but onboarding does not seem to work at least not my own thread, it only responds Welcome, &lt;user&gt;. Tried with creating an Onboarding1 in the botkitstudio and set it in the components/onboarding.js but it does not trigger by that call.
It does not seem to be called in the console in studio. Any idea someone?
I can imagine, some ppl are sleeping right now :slightly_smiling_face: I fly away and hope there will be a reply sooner or later *flies*
I found out you will need to fix that yourself in the botkit-starter-slack/skills/sample_events, nevermind. Now I really fly away for a time being. But I would like to really thank Ben and his company for this great bot, it works splendid
I cannot use websockets anymore, does anyone know why?
The permission scope of `im:read` is included.

Hey everybody! Do you have some ressources about learning how to use Botkit's NodeJS SDK? I mean except the official documentation?
that is the best resource at the moment, but feel free to ask any advanced questions on the github or over in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit>
Its seems that nobody is responding in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> lol
Hi, how can I prevent my Bot from showing up under "DIRECT MESSAGES"? I just want the team to use the bot's slash command and not show the bot as a bot user

hi all, I'm a beginner looking to learn more
are bots able to access chat data - either in messenger or on slack?
I also have the same question, can we access the chat data?
(i mean, beyond the user's chat with the bot fyi)
It depends on the permissions of the bot and where the conversations take place. 
Hello
How to overcome this bug in my bot program?
Hi, how can I prevent my Bot from showing up under "DIRECT MESSAGES" after installation? I just want the team to use the bot's slash command and not show the bot as a bot user
I am a beginner and I followed the differents docs files but I can't connect cisco-spark starter pack with my bot. Does anyone have some time to teach me ?
<@U5WK01H71> hey there! I can help you out. join the <#C2DR1AJD7|cisco_spark> channel and DM me :slightly_smiling_face:
Hi, does anybody know which graphics library is used by statsbot. <@U0GRGF85N> ?
Any bot creator/developer from Canada here? I'm looking to make a bot for the airline and fintech industry. Hit me up, let's chat
why my slack messages encoding? e.g. Let's Validate became Let%27s Validate
Awesome work <@U5VFAL5DY> and <http://UXDesign.cc|UXDesign.cc> team. I agree that chatbots currently lack proper human escalation protocols. 
Hello everyone, when I tried to make the connection via slack_client.rtm_connect()  it always returned “False”. Does anybody know how to deal with this?
<@U5URZ4FL0> - mine is now doing the same thing after rebuilding my docker app...
guess if anybody has any solutions pass it along! slack status is saying everything is good... think that is a big fat lie.

thanks.
Hi I am looking for anyone who was able to get carousels working?
itsmejainh: you can't update other people's messages with a bot. see <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.update>
<@U5YF8SWR5> Hi, that is possible can you try to add other permissions `channels:write` , `chat:write:bot`.
I added those permissions and then I am able to edit my own messages
<@U3RAA8WSJ> rewind
Great... let me process your channel.
See below two of the best items I found. For the complete list, <https://web.paperbot.ai/?utm_source=slack&amp;utm_medium=messaging&amp;utm_campaign=rewind | click here>.
<@U3S6WLUM7> you should not install your bot in <#C04SM6TAK|general>  and also your bot <@U3RAA8WSJ>  is DMing all the members of this community for sign ups. Which is strictly not allowed. 
<@U0V93GE5R> , <@U04SM6T2H> please take appropriate action. 
But I want is - capability to edit all messages posted by anyone with some formatting
<@U0Y7H2F3M> thanks for that report
Hey Ya'll, does anyone use redux in there chatbots?
Curious. There's a 500 API limit even for hosting it on own server?
hi. i'm having some trouble wrapping my head around botkit and the slack api. i'm having a bit of a "drinking from a firehose" feeling. there seem to be a bunch of different methods of authentication, of communicating with the slack api, etc. does anybody have any advice? i'm trying to figure out what's the absolute bare minimum i need to get a bot up and able to read and write from a channel but am not having much success.
hi guys. i'm trying to write a chatbot that's asking for email, phone number, age, etc. do you have any idea how could i build the conversational flow so that if someone replies with an invalid email address, the chatbot would ask them to type a valid email address. after they retyped the email and it was validated, the chatbot should go to the next question?
drguildo: did you start with the Slack starter kit?
you can start super easily here: <https://glitch.com/~botkit-slack>
anam1: check out the conversation docs: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/readme.md#conversation-threads>. at a high level - sounds like you should have one `thread` that ask the core questions - email, phone, age, etc. then you should have another thread for the case of an incorrect email (use regex to check) that you can jump to and ask for the correct email, and jump back once you have it
<@U4HG47ZGD> thanks
I also made a video walkthrough for that you might enjoy: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us2zdf0vRz0>
Random question - has anyone had a lot of problems with Facebooks account system if you've only set one up to access their Developer Platform?
I'm getting so much grief about "suspicious activity"
thanks but how is a project with 20+ files super simple?
i managed to take a machete to some example code and it turns out you only really need about 4 lines of code to get a slack bot connected and processing events
but all the code and documentation i've looked at overcomplicate things
there's a lot going on but really the /skills folder is all you need to look at to start out. slack just has a bunch of different ways to process events.
having fun writing this macOS app <https://higher.team/blog/2017/june/native-macos-slack-client-not-electron> any alpha testers out there?
do anyone know here how to integrate Telegram with Slack : I have a group in telegram and I want send &amp; receive msgs from Slack Channel
do anyone know how I can join a real user to any channel through nodejs?
I am new to  slackbot
salimhurjuk: i dont think botkit has telegram support yet, but you could start with a Slack bot in Botkit and send/receive requests via the Telegram api, or even write Botkit middleware for telegram :slightly_smiling_face:
you can also use botkit studio for this, it's a very simple flow and you will need to write only very little code
azizimranz: you want to invite a real user to a channel in slack, is that what you mean? use the channels.invite method <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.invite>
Thanks for the reply Vikyan.
hi everybody! :slightly_smiling_face:
hey there :slightly_smiling_face:
Is there a standard way to direct message a large list of users in a team? When I try to loop through them and startConversation, I get a `Callback was already called.` error.
how to separate slack app from production and development? need to test app before deployment
bakhtiyor: I think most of us actually have 2 different apps for that purpose
Yep, me too. Sometimes more even, for seperate devs and staging too
yeah, i created "fake" apps, but wanted your experiences
thanks
how to resolve it?
same thing here, separate apps for each dev and staging.  Pretty easy to manage once all set up.  Only issue we ran into was sharing slash cmds in the same team.
We have a separate Slack team up and running that we use to test apps in a dev environment.
I created a basic FAQ bot for my company. when I tried to include in our slack group. it is working only if add it to channel. Can i make it not include in channel so users can post directly to slackbot
<@U2ST09C5V> the slack bot i did was an outgoing webhook and it only saw messages that started with the bot's keyword… is that what you're looking for? (I didn't actually test across channels that i recall)
<@U4Y8PNP6V> for sharing slash cmds, i put some "namespaces", e.g. `/analyze`, `/analyze:dev`, `/analyze:staging`
Is there any open source Bot framework available that support  web chat like a Drift?
You mean like web-based real-time message framework?
neel: posted a reply over in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit>
Hey! I'm wondering if its a good idea to be able to pass in a tickInterval as config?
Does anyone have documentation on how to make message buttons (not message menus) for a bot that isn't an app
trfylh: why not just make it an app
Doing it for an internal company thing, don't have a choice unfortunately :disappointed:
My understanding is only an app can respond to interactive messages
Also, in case it helps for an internal thing: apps can be private — don't have to list them in the directory.
^ what <@U0D7F12ER> said! just make it a private app
We use private apps as our primary method of distribution. Everything runs via a bot, but because we're enabling our customers to talk to _their_ customers, we need the bot to be branded according to the company (vs. a bot named after us).
Thank you!
Unable to verify url while creating slack app
Hi all
Can we create a bot to talk to another bot in Facebook Workplace ? Is there any sample code I can refer?
ezree: will respond over in <#C11Q41CR3|fb-messenger>
Hi there.  Is there a detailed step by step code tutorial on setting up OAUTH for Slack apps for a non-developer?
<@U4E6DDG6L> you can use our prebuilt boilerplate app that uses oauth. we have docs for setting it all up.
I will DM you some links
Please sir.
What's the best way to scale a bot that connects to multiple teams across several servers?
e.g. Let's say I'm connecting to 1000 Slack teams using websockets. I need to spread that load to a max of 100/server (hypothetical)
How can I ensure that each of the 10 servers is connecting to the right teams without duplication?
you'd probably want to set up some kind of microservice that can track all 1000 servers and distribute them 100 at a time as they're requested
something with express would be easy ish
the main problem you might have is determining when a server has gone down (for restarts or whatever) -- possibly could have each server re-validate their connection to the microservice every 5m or so
<@U62H7MAG2> That seems like a case serverless ! (<http://serverless.com>) I'm currently working around with it, and it's what I'd use, coupled with either dynamoDB or Google Cloud Datastore depending on the needs and mood of the day
anyone know what are the other values of “attachment_type”? I've only seen “default” on slack documentation pages (<https://api.slack.com/docs/interactive-message-field-guide>, <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-buttons>)
Has anyone done authenticated app unfurls? There is an option to send a user_auth_required to get the user to authenticate. But looks like it still required a token for the request. Since the user hasn't authenticated yet, which token do you use? I'm guessing I have to keep track of the token of the first user who authenticated the app and use that here?

<@U62EJPRUH> No bots in general please 
Hello! I've run starterbot in PyCharm and everything was ok. But when I've written in command line"python starterbot.py", I got an import error " No module named slackclient". Why??
<https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient/issues/183>
<@U3NFQN97H>: There is no other value for now, It's a placeholder for future features
<@U500C4E05>: to make it more complicated, also check out: <https://github.com/BeepBoopHQ/slapp>
I personally don't like botkit's approach. You end up writing different bots for different platforms anyways. Go for somehting Slack specific and always uptodate with the API features. Will make your life easier from my experience.
<@U6330SLE9>: yes that's true. You are expected to respond within 3 seconds.
When your response requires some time to be processed (e.g. when generating a statistic) then reply immediately with a message that states that you are currently processing the request and update or respond to this messages when you have your result.
When you are having trouble to respond within 3 seconds even when your use case is simple then you should look into why your performance is so bad. You should aim for 100ms response time for standard responses in production mode. When testing locally using tunnels you might run into this limit from time to time though. Just ignore it.
Thanks <@U54C2FV2L> that's exactly my concern, so far the `bot.api` in botkit seems to be handling that very nicely, so basically there is a 1-to-1 mapping with slack's API. However, I'll definitely look into slapp and see if a platform specific toolkit will be more flexible, because in the end I just want to create a Slack specific bot.
happy that I could be of help :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks <@U54C2FV2L> :slightly_smiling_face:
Hello, I am not able to make an account on botkit website for quite a while, are you guys still up?
<@U66575GER> <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit>
this isn't only a botkit chat
pavelescu.razvan: What error are you seeing specifically? We also have <#C4MJKM145|botkit_studio>
hi guys. I'm running a slash command that calls an aws lambda function.  The command works just fine and responds with the correct info. THen slack immediately shows the error: “Darn – that slash command didn't work (error message: `502_service_error`).” …. Any ideas whats going wrong?
tennis: try adding `bot.replyAcknowledge();`
also this is probably better suited for <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> and/or <#C0K8617D5|slack-api> :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks. Will do.
This message was deleted.
is this a slack bot or what service are you connecting to?
It's a Slack Bot connecting using rtm.connect
I'm getting a websocket error. However, if it doesn't connect it should just print my else statement, but it continues as if it connected.
<@U69AVHSRL> what is RTM for reference?
Hi everybody! I just make my robot with botkit, I have in my slack team already and I saw the event "onboarding" was trigger when I installed it. Now the problem is that I cannot trigger any other script, I've tried with the "hello" script and one that I made yesterday but nothing happend. Is there anything I did wrong? should I activate the events in the my API slack? Thanks for your attentions. Regards!
well I answer myself, I have found that I miss some parameters like the bot needs to receive events and some other configurations, every other thing was OK. Here I found the answer for my question (video from howdy by the way): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us2zdf0vRz0>
Hi Guys,
i am kinda new to the bot building and AI, how ever trying my best to learn stuff as quickly as possible.
I need some help
i am tasked to build an enterprise chatbot that will communicate with a Qlik Sense and fetch requested data from it
i have gone through multiple tutorials and am more confused than ever..
these are the parts that i was able to figure out
- Natural Language Processing &amp; Understanding using <http://API.AI|API.AI>
- Building a Bot Using Microsoft Bot Framework with Node Js
- Integrating <http://API.Ai|API.Ai> with my botframework
how ever the tricky part is Qlik Sense uses a Websocket protocol for communicating with Qlik Engine.
Now i am super confused as to how do i map the intents and entities to the Websocket api's
Any help is much appreciated, thank you
I'd recommend checking out a more specific channel to try to maximize the expertise of folks who see it: <#C63KSHE2C|bot-framework> is the channel for MS Bot Framework folks which could be a good spot to start
<@U4T67EY1X> yep! there is a conversation over their now if people want to reply!
whoops one sec
the correct channel is actually: <#C0UUYSF1P|botbuilder>
<@U4T67EY1X>  Sure thank you
will do

thanks!
Hey all, 100% new to bots. I want to relay messages between a slack channel and hangout/groupme. Can you point me in the right direction?
With something like postman, you'll have a field for a URL (your incoming webhook URL) and the ability to easily just say "I'm posting JSON" and copy and paste it into a box hit send and check out the result.
Can you add scripts as treads in other scripts? Like can you import scripts to use as treads? I'm finding that I'm repeating myself a lot.
So I'm looking for a way that I can reuse that script if it's possible.
Hello everyone!
if you are using botkit studio if you wrap the script as a skill then you can `trigger` the script anytime using `controller.studio.runTrigger`
start with the slack bot starter kit! <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack>. easiest thing is to just get it setup with Glitch. then you'll have to look into the hangout/groupme apis those aren't supported by botkit yet so you could integrate with them directly or build some botkit middleware :slightly_smiling_face:
real time messahing
This is cool. Any experience/thoughts deploying the botkit for slack framework to stdlib?
Thanks
I just create one slack botchat using botkit. I congured everything but now i am stuck i could not run the application
can any one help me how can I test my application
Hi
What alternatives to Botkit Studio do you use to manage messages etc. Just a normal admin backend with flask or node ? Sorry for a noob question, just trying to get my head around the best way to keeping a bot up to date, e.g. My bot projects sends reminders, motivation etc. So I need to be able to manage those easily
What's up fellow bot makers
I've a quick newbie question, regarding node.js bots
After conducting a api method how do i pass the output, of let's say the channel value to a variable?
Hey I have question to the Slack API for python, I am making a “chat.postMessage” call with the api_call() method, and I try to make a post of String, when I look in slack, the string is getting formatted, how can I avoid that? Thanks
Just curious what is undesirable about using studio for this?
<https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage/test>
I don't know the pricing yet and would like to plan longer term if this makes sense, I think botkit studio is great but I have no transparency over future costs 
we are close to announcing pricing, let me send you a dm!

how can I manage a slack-bot with dynamic response using Ruby language
I am new to slack-bot and ruby
2. ruby installed
i want a response from my bot if i ask anything to the bot
Try send `help` to <@U3NTT2Z3K>
You may find what you're looking for
Welcome bot doesn't have much in the way of ruby specific info, sadly 
<@U6BFN2S3X>
just a friendly reminder: please dont run bots in <#C04SM6TAK|general>
<@U3NTT2Z3K> tell me how to output variables from a api method?
What type of bots are you guys working on?
Welcome is a little more general than that. Try messaging it help for a list of topics 
I'm jkin
Fixed my problem anyways
anyone point me in the direction of making bots have user abilities like so -&gt; <@U3NTT2Z3K>
that bot is made with botkit studio! using very little botkit code
<https://studio.botkit.ai/login>
but actual using api methods?
or rtm client
It's built using events api. Using studio will give you access to deploying a starter kit on glitch or heroku, or you can host it yourself. Welcome bot is powered by glitch!
Can someone help us get Botkit hooked up to Spark through Heroic deployment?

I created a bot and hosting on glitch. but i get this error "Your bot has not yet made an API request."
I checked env file and im sure everything is correct
any idea?
anyone know how to close the browser window and come back to slack?
i'm doing an app that opens the browser (on mobile, its an OK embedded browser) to do a speech recognition task.
I want to close the browser and come back to the chat window…
window.close() and history.back() both do not work
ie if you send a link in a chat then the browser would launch
<https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webview/close>
equivalent to ^
I guess slack doesn't really have ‘integrated' webview experience.
is there any other way to capture audio input than opening the browser?
Anyone building a tipbot here :slightly_smiling_face:
I am nearly done with it also!
Node.js and ruby
Lol talk about an 'active' slack

Is there a way to have good metrics/monitoring/logging without setting up express for my botkit application?
hey Guys. I want to explore Bots for FB messenger, anyone knows of a descent boiler plate bot Dev for Fb Messenger  ? thank you so much in advance!
boilerplate for FB messenger ;node.js/js if possible- thanks
<https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-facebook> :wink:
^ that one is really good.
you can discuss it in <#C11Q41CR3|fb-messenger>
Awesome!! thank you so much guys!!
Hi guys, I am trying to figure out how to make a simple mathbot using this: <https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md#env>
But im having trouble, I would love some help
Is the only connection to the bot when coding just the .env folder with only this in it: SLACK_API_TOKEN=xoxb-tokenstuffwhichiwontshowontheinternet
Has anyone else stopped receiving event notifications from slack? Both bots, running on different servers as different apps, suddenly stopped receiving events
slack is having trouble rn <https://status.slack.com/>
^
ugh, right can't delete that
Thanks! Bookmarked for future ref.
Do you have more and more status code 500 when you do api call to slack?
statuscode 500 returns a html webpage instead of a json object from cloudfront (or cloudflare, i don't remember)
we have members of the slack team over in <#C0K8617D5|slack-api> btw
anyone good at ruby, i need some help with a bot?
detecting user input mostly
Hi All, we're looking into moving over to slackclient from Slacker for our Python apps.
Wondering if it has support for Python 3 yet... there seems to be some confusion about this.
Also, do we need to use a token or can we just rely on incoming webhook urls?
Thanks!
<@U6DTPT746> I can help. We can move this to the <#C0HUW58BC|language-ruby> channel
ok im there

anyone know how to use ngrok and accept the challenge when requesting the url
make sure your web app/server/whatever is running when you start ngrok, and point Slack at the URL that ngrok prints out as the `https` URL
you should get the challenge just like Slack was connecting directly.
how am i able to get the bot object outside of a controller.hears type of event?  i saw one thread on github where someone says to `controller.spawn()` and assign that to a variable, but that doesn't appear to work.  really i am trying to get the app token, which is usually at `bot.config.bot.app_token`, but `controller.spawn().config` is empty
If all you need is the `app_token` I would recommend fetching it out of storage. `controller.storage.teams.get(team_id)`.  That would get around the spawn issue.
thanks, having a look
Anyone else haveing same issue?. Tried deleting node modules and re-installed the libraries, no use
have you tried deleting your `package-lock` file and re-installing?
checked your `nodejs` version on your server?

I'm trying to get access logs for my bot <https://github.com/onaio/karma/blob/14-implement-logging/lib/Facebook.js#L64>
However, expressWinston only logs for routes defined after the logger has been instantiated.
Is there a way I can log requests for routes that were instantiated by botkit without copying the botkit routes and replicating logic that botkit provides?
which is better RTM or Event API ?
Depends on what you're planning to do
Event API is much easier and RTM a bit more powerful.
Am I asking the wrong question or is my code trash? I wonder why nobody here answers me.
there's not many people on in this time zone <@U4U6P9L1M> - some people are but perhaps those that can answer you aren't?
Oh that's encouraging
<@U5D3HQ6R0> :slightly_smiling_face: thanks
OK I found the solution from the FB botkit code. Instantiate the logger before the call to `createWebhookEndpoints`
any tutorial for RTM and python ?
Thanks in advance
<@U6330SLE9> <https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html> is a little out of date but still looks like a decent tutorial.
Does it have to be RTM? Can you use the Events API? If so: <https://github.com/slackapi/python-slack-events-api/tree/master/example>
Hi guys, I am developing a bot using RTM API, is it possible to connect and subscribe to certain channel only?
Normally you receive only message from channel where the bot are. So you just have to get your bot into channels you wanted to subscribe.
Thanks!
Guys, I'm trying to make an interactive menu with a button so user can choose an option from menu, then push the button and get the result. But I can't get how to do it, menu field clears right after I choose anything in it :disappointed: Can anyone help me? Maybe any live examples? I'm using Python.
I tried to attach metadata, but dont see it in the FB request
node-slack-interactive-messages anybody tried this
<https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-interactive-messages>
i am trying to add messages with buttons through hubot
<@U6DAU7PS6> tried <https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-interactive-messages>
Yep, but I've tried it with Python language. It's pretty simple if you're not trying to do anything sophisticated.
I'm trying to deploy a hubot instance to cloud foundry but it's getting stuck after it writes `DEBUG Loading adapter slack` to log
any thoughts on what it could be
?
Hey, has anyone here ran botkit with pm2 as the process manager and how did that go for them? It seems to start multiple processes (some sort of LB) and that makes continuing with a  conversation impossible.
or hard
hmmm I believe I have solved it by setting instances to 1 but I wish there was a way to make the pm2 process manager work something like a sticky load balancer.
Thanks
Elm is an eager language, not laziness unless explicitly introduced
That choice was made back when we still did FRP, but some of the reasoning still applies - <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/elm-discuss/9XxV9L0zoA0/cx3UMZ05Gc0J>
my version are elm 0.18.0, node 8.1.1, npm 5.0.3.  Yes, I can see the "update: DoSignUp" in the console as well.  But I was expecting the "Got the cmd" and data being passed around using the ports feature.  That is not happening when I press the sign up button in the Main.elm page.  Thanks again for the assist <@U0JFFPRHP>.
I'll try a simple ports example and play around with that.
is there a quick way of getting the month number instead of the Month type, from a `Date.Date`
Introducing laziness in Elm would only lead to strange bugs where you'd have to introduce strictness functions at non-obvious places. Not so good for newcomers
hardfire: the Date.Extra package will let you if you don't mind adding a dependency - <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justinmimbs/elm-date-extra/latest/Date-Extra>
thanks <@U18S4094L> , i might do that if have another Date-ish requirement again. Right now I just did my own Month-&gt;Int function
<@U48AEBJQ3> i dont see logged content in the command line. Debug.log is supposed to print in the browser console, but there is none for the npm runner
When running Elm-test, it should just appear in the console
