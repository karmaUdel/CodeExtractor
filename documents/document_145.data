```
digging through the source, looks like I need to populate the storage or hold onto the rtm.start payload for reference
looking at the comment, looks like it was a thought but never implemented: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/lib/Slackbot_worker.js#L84>
hey <@U0H8KT3AN>
the storage is empty yes
you would have to build your own caching scheme
and I wouldn't recommend using the storage for caching
since it is persistent
yeah, I realized that looking at it more
its really more for storing data on behalf of the team
just doing a quick flattened object
just a simple starting point
Does botkit do any auto marking messages as read?
