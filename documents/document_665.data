Do that outside of my environment?
Yeah, if you installed `virtualenv` with `python2` (or `pip` from py2) - it will use that interpreter as the default if you don't give the `--python/-p` flag
hmm, i gave it the python3 flag and it's still giving the same error
Silly question, I am sure, but did you `pip install -r requirements.txt` since re-creating the env?
yup!
pip3
Figured so :slightly_smiling_face:
But it seems to be using my system libraries. Is that weird?
It looks like we have similar environments <@U3JGK19NV>. I make my venvs like so `mkvirtualenv --python="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/python3" new virtualenv`
not exactly the same and I use `mkvirtualenv`
Ahh okay
why is it not `/usr/local/bin/python3`?
he installed via the python installer
`/usr/local/bin/python3` is from brew
Thanks, <@U1BP42MRS>. I actually didn't have a solid answer there :neutral_face:. These are notes I took a long time ago that became a habit.
Hmm, i still can't get it to work
I've used the `--python="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/python3"` flag when creating the environment
here's my terminal output from when i CD
what do you get when you run `python -V`
A very long output!
I think it's because you don't have a pip3 under `bin` folder.
capital `V`
you did lowercase, which is a verbose log of the interpreter starting
so it's using a default `pip3` which installs libs into `/usr/local/lib`, but search path in environment is looking into `./lib/&lt;version&gt;/site-packages`?
whoops, sorry!
Looks like having a space in there is causing your problems
