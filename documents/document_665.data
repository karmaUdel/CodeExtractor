U3SJEDR96 : And once you've done that, figure out if it really matters. If you're writing application code, it seems unlikely that this would make a perceptible difference, and will most likely be completely dwarfed by the cost of rendering..
U17MHJ12N : Gaaa it's a fine line between consolidating modules and entering into circular reference hell
U5GSVKPJS : ```The 1st branch has this type:

    elm-make: Type applications without concrete names should not get here.
```

U5GSVKPJS : amazing.
U0EUHKVGB : If you want help, you’re going to have to share code :wink:
U5GSVKPJS : haha, it was more me laughing at the error message
U0EUHKVGB : <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/issues/1390>
U3SJEDR96 : Feels like a result of no kind checking <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/issues/1373>
U3SJEDR96 : :smile:
U5GSVKPJS : ```
createFirmware apiContext projectId url name =
    Http.postJson
        (let
            opts =
                Http.defaultJsonArgs apiContext
         in
            { opts
                | path =
                    [ "project-firmware", toString projectId ]
                , value =
                    Just &lt;|
                        EncodeJson.object []
            }
        )
```

Seems to do it. If I comment out the `value` assignment, all is well

U5GSVKPJS : Now I've got```
-- TYPE MISMATCH ----------------------------- ././src/Page/Project/Firmware.elm

The right side of (|&gt;) is causing a type mismatch.

69|               Task.sequence (createFirmwares apiContext model.projectId files)
70|&gt;                |&gt; Task.perform (always FirmwareChanged)

(|&gt;) is expecting the right side to be a:

    elm-make: type applications should start with a type atom
```

U5GSVKPJS : And I'm truly stuck. I'm not sure what to do next, is there any obvious code to look at?
U5GSVKPJS : I moved `createFirmwares` (and `createFirmware`) to a separate module, and that module now compiles just fine
U5GSVKPJS : I'll rip out other code from this module and see if it's something else interacting badly
U0EUHKVGB : <@U5GSVKPJS> My advice when debugging things like this: use more type annotations
U0EUHKVGB : Put things into let bindings, and write the type signature by hand
U5GSVKPJS : yea, I did that, and now I'm at this, which is super suspicious:
U5GSVKPJS : ```Function `createFirmwares` is expecting the 3rd argument to be:

    List { a | name : String, url : String }

But it is:

    List
```

U5GSVKPJS : I should be able to fix that, but gotta go grab lunch
U5GSVKPJS : And indeed:
U5GSVKPJS : `    | FilesUploaded List`
U5GSVKPJS : Whoops!
U0EUHKVGB : Yep
U3SJEDR96 : :smile:
U0EUHKVGB : It’s a tricky one to debug
U5GSVKPJS : Is it worth reporting that, or is this particular instance of the bug known?
U0EUHKVGB : It is known
