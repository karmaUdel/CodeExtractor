U3YDBDP4Z : Hmm true true
U3SJEDR96 : (you'll need `(Model, Cmd Msg)` in your type annotation, tho)
U3YDBDP4Z : Thanks for the guidance!
U3YDBDP4Z : Does Elm use `and` or `&amp;&amp;`?
U3YDBDP4Z : Feels like it _should_ be `and` but the compiler doesn't recognize it
U3YDBDP4Z : Perhaps I'm missing some parentheses
U3SJEDR96 : it's `&amp;&amp;`, <@U3YDBDP4Z> <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Basics#&amp;&amp;>
U3YDBDP4Z : "Cannot find variable !=" :confused:
U3SJEDR96 : `/=` in elm
U3SJEDR96 : though if you're still dealing with `Maybe`, it's often more readable to use `Maybe.map` and - possibly - `Maybe.withDefault` to fallback to a default value.
U3YDBDP4Z : If I have these types,```
type PrivateRoute
    = HomeRoute


type PublicRoute
    = AboutRoute
    | NotFoundRoute
    | SignInRoute


type Route
    = PrivateRoute
    | PublicRoute
```
can't `PrivateRoute` and `PublicRoute` be matched as `Route`? :confused:

Trying to put together something that allows me to use a single `case route of` to work with private or public routes

U3YDBDP4Z : In case of a private route, I need to do something. In case of public route, I need to do something else
U3SJEDR96 : You can't "sum" types like that, but you can tag them - `type Route = Private PrivateRoute | Public PublicRoute`
U3SJEDR96 : you can use these in a single case, btw:```
case route of
    Private HomeRoute -&gt; ...
    Public AboutRoute -&gt; ...
    Public NotFoundRoute -&gt; ...
    Public _ -&gt; ...
```

U3YDBDP4Z : Thanks again
U1AN4JRFV : jxxcarlson: Thank you for spelling that out for me. I did notice that it didn't update the correct document, but I thought that could not have anything to do with that, but was intended. And then I had to suddenly run. Did you get help?
U3YDBDP4Z : If `Models` has this type,```
type Route
    = RouteName PrivateRoute
```

Why does an import of `Models` and the use of `Models.Route` somewhere yield a "Models does not expose Route" error?

U0JL9RPC4 : You can expose an union type outside of your module but by default, it does not expose its constructors
U0JL9RPC4 : you have to make something like `export (Route(..))`
U3YDBDP4Z : I had that but with the same problem
U5LHS71SM : Hey, I have a question:I need to display a svg generated by a .js file, I guess I should use ports but I couldn't actually think how to use ports with that? Thanks for the help in advance!

U14Q8S4EM : I can think of two solutions <@U5LHS71SM>
U14Q8S4EM : One would be the manually append it to an html element generated in Elm.
