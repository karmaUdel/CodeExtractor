or something along those lines
Almost working. My model is not changing. I have init with some initial fake data. My  model should be overwritten by update, right? It looks like the model is keeping only that init data values.
I would imagine that the model is not _actually_ being updated then for some reason. Either the wrong action is firing or there is some sort of issue in the `update` function.
Maybe I missed it, where is the code that kicks off the Ajax request?
