Boat.draw calls Sailors.draw```
So please help to find out the way how can I print the output in new console opened using subprocess.
Hello
<@U68Q8495W> <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15899798/subprocess-popen-in-different-console>
in short, you need `shell=True` in your `Popen` call
I was hoping I could get some help with a script to parse some json files 
And save the output. Need to iterate it 
you should post the part where you are stuck and I'm sure someone will help you :slightly_smiling_face:
Hi Jason, Thanks and from the link you have mentioned, it says i can use subprocess without `shell=true` by sending the command in list. Opening new console is fine for me and the problem is I cant output the stdout in that new console. Becasue I have to redirect the output to a file and console both on real time.
:)
Can i post my question on stack overflow?
I mean the link to the question 
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45087325/set-up-a-crawler-and-downloaded-tweets-unable-to-parse-json-file?noredirect=1#comment77166732_45087325>
<@U69HXQZJ9> Do you have an example JSON file you're having trouble with?
Yes I do. It's a twitter json file 
Usually JSON files can be loaded with json.loads(f) and then used as a standard Python data structure (nested arrays and dicts etc)
<@U69HXQZJ9> Well, attach it then?
Let me turn on my laptop. One minute 
<@U69HXQZJ9> Sure, no hurry.
Thanks, I'll try to read it.
When I tried to parse it using other scripts, it would give me (ValueError: Extra data: line 2 column 1 - line 1201 column 1 (char 13339 - 8801096)
For starters, thats *not* a valid JSON file.
It's more like a text file where every line seems to contain a JSON representation of an object.
...workin....
Ahh
I had set up a crawler to download scripts 
Sorry 
Tweets I mean 
Is there a way I can fix it?
