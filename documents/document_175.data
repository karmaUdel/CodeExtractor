U069GF9UY : ```Hey @Curator, give me something new to look at```
U04SM6T2H : now you're talking
U04SM6T2H : “How about this selection, sir?"
U04SM6T2H : heh
U04SM6K6N : I dreamed that I was using spellcheck markings in Slack as a code to help the Cluster in Sense8 communicate with each other when the bad guy was eavesdropping on their psychic chats.
U069GF9UY : Guys, I think we may think about Slack too much.
U04SM6T2H : I just received this message as a neural impulse
U04SM6T2H : so yes
U069GF9UY : ```/zapbensbrain```
U069GF9UY : ```/overloadbensbrain```
U069GF9UY : ```/johnnymnemonic```
U069GF9UY : none of these do anything, how disappointing.
U069GF9UY : ps <@U04SX1L23>, haven't seen that error, but I like your llama.png.
U04SM6T2H : heh
U04SX1L23 : <@U069GF9UY>: hah, thanks! :simple_smile:
U04SX1L23 : I also made a commodore 64 version. :wink:
U04SX1L23 : Just in case...
U069GF9UY : :hearts:
U04SM6T2H : so rad
U05334HCE : Is there a way to use the RTM API or similar to "intercept" messages?
U05334HCE : Example use case: suppose you wanted to automatically replace all instances of "foo" with "bar" in all messages.
U04SM6T2H : no
U05334HCE : :disappointed:
U04SM6T2H : I think to do something like that
U04SM6T2H : you'd have to use the RTM api
U04SM6T2H : to hear the message
U04SM6T2H : then use the web API to submit a message edit on behalf of the specific user
U04SM6T2H : which would require that specific user to auth with oauth
U04SM6T2H : even then not sure if its possible
U05334HCE : hmm interesting
U055FHACC : Hi everyone, this is our big day on Product Hunt! Come visit us, conversation there is missing serious robot supporters<http://bit.ly/meekanPH>

U04S3JCH2 : very cool!
U069GF9UY : Nice, good luck
U04SM6T2H : <@U055FHACC> is this just the launch of your slack component?
U055FHACC : Yes. You can look at it as an interface to the scheduling engine, but definitely our best one yet. Describing your meeting request in plain words is the best way to convey intent (on our former products, you need to pick from preset buttons). And having the groups already built and in place is a major plus too
U04SM6T2H : yeah super cool
U04S3JCH2 : looks like you're having a good day on PH!
U055FHACC : we're overwhelmed. seriously. I got all my devices here beeping like crazy
U069GF9UY : :clap:
U04SM6T2H : <http://interconnected.org/home/2015/06/16/conversational_uis>
U04SM6T2H : tons of great stuff in there
U04SM6T2H : Matt Webb is a guy who has been talking about htis stuff for a decade
U04SM6T2H : he's great!
U069GF9UY : this is a treasure trove.
U04SM6T2H :  Yeah 
U04SM6T2H : Matt is also one of the BASAAP people
U04SM6T2H : "Be as smart as a puppy"
U069GF9UY : You got me before I could post a gif of puppies
U04SM6T2H : Heh
U06E352LU : hello :simple_smile:just joined after seeing a post on PH about this community

U04S3JCH2 : welcome!
U06E352LU : thanks <@U04S3JCH2>  :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : Not slack related but still interesting:
U04SM6T2H : <https://sevabot-skype-bot.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>
U04SM6T2H : skype bot
U04SM6T2H : Whoa
U04SM6T2H : <http://www.reigndesign.com/blog/building-a-wechat-weixin-robot/>
U069GF9UY : Nice!  I'm going to try to implement that in my bot.
U04S3JCH2 : <@U055FHACC>: we need a post-Product Hunt day report! Meekan killed it.
U069GF9UY : Bravo!
U04S6E9EW : <https://medium.com/@angiecois/an-incomplete-list-of-communities-on-slack-1b1b6f157bda>
U04SM6T2H : <https://medium.com/why-not/can-a-bot-help-you-at-your-job-8b1b13d7ed8>
U04SM6T2H : We're looking for feedback from folks like you
U06E352LU : nice article ! totally believe in this :simple_smile: are becoming a bot consultancy company?
U04SM6T2H : We're doing our best.
U06E352LU : love that idea :simple_smile: currently working on <http://botz.io|botz.io>, a marketplace for bots, a way to distribute bots easily, and I am looking for betatester, we should talk :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : whoa
U04SM6T2H : cool yeah
U06E352LU : trying to define what devs need, which endpoints in the API..
U04SM6T2H : We're probably working on a lot of the same things
U06E352LU : it's working but not really well documented yet :stuck_out_tongue:
U0644KVQE : <@U055FHACC>: nice work with Meekan, looks really good. How are you handling supporting multiple RTM connections for different teams?
U05334HCE : <@U06E352LU>: will this also be a platform for _hosting_ slack bots?
U06E352LU : <@U05334HCE>: at the moment I don't think so, have to find what devs want
U06E352LU : It's more for heavy users of slack that are looking for bots. And devs that want to distribute them
U05334HCE : it would be cool to have a heroku-like place that caters to slack bots and then you monetize both sides
U05334HCE : i'd use it
U06E352LU : <@U05334HCE> you having issue hosting your bots?
U05334HCE : I feel like heroku et al are pricing me out of reasonable bot hosting plans
U05334HCE : but also imagining a meteor-like env where you have lots of bot stuff available out of the box etc.
U05334HCE : just daydreaming
U06E352LU : Meteor ? I have that for you :p
U06E352LU : I'm using <http://scalingo.com|scalingo.com> to host my bots
U06E352LU : Or Better .. Serverless <https://docs.apitools.com/blog/2015/01/15/a-slack-bot-without-a-server.html>
U05334HCE : So scalingo is a good example of insane pricing for a bot that isn't much more complex than "hello world"
U05334HCE : 7.20 euros per month
U05334HCE : nope
U05334HCE : I want something that abstracts infra work like these platforms do, but has reasonable pricing for tiny tiny low traffic apps
U05334HCE : Will def look into the serverless thing though
U06E352LU : i see what you mean… dunno any solution that will fit that need
U05334HCE : well heroku used to be perfect
U05334HCE : with their free tier
U05334HCE : now their pricing is changing and I need to find a new home
U05334HCE : What I'd really love to do is just pay like $100 a month for effectively unlimited micro containers or whatever
U05334HCE : and if a given micro app starts to pass some resource threshold, then force me to upgrade it to a "normal" paid single-app tier
U05334HCE : this is a more general problem than slack bots. i like to make lots of stupid stuff.
U06E352LU : totally understand.. I have lot of stupid things online too :stuck_out_tongue:
U04SM6T2H : <@U05334HCE>: digital ocean might be a good option for us
U04SM6T2H : $5 server that can run a dozen node processes
U05334HCE : that is the leading candidate
U04SM6T2H : But also
U05334HCE : but i wish it abstracted away the infra stuff more
U04SM6T2H : I think something will emerge 
U05334HCE : i want heroku-level easy of use
U04SM6T2H : Yeah 
U05334HCE : i think so too
U04SM6T2H : We do too
U04SM6T2H : git push botcloud master 
U05334HCE : i feel like heroku and i had a bad break up
U05334HCE : :sob:
U04SM6T2H : I'm over it
U04SM6T2H : Too expensive for what it is
U05334HCE : agree
U05334HCE : the new pricing is dumb
U05334HCE : and alienating
U04SM6T2H : We built a custom deployment system for doing hot updates based on git push and never looked back
U04SM6T2H : We have 20 sites running on a $5 digital ocean server
U05334HCE : omg git repo pls
U05334HCE : ben pls
U05334HCE : that seems like something they would want to integrate into their service
U04SM6T2H : Who?
U04SM6T2H : Heroku?
U05334HCE : digital ocean
U05334HCE : unless I misunderstood
U05334HCE : I thought you were saying you wrote some git fu stuff to make DO act like heroku
U04SM6T2H : yeah
U04SM6T2H : we did
U04SM6T2H : heh
U04SM6T2H : and its a slackbot :wink:
U04SM6T2H : push to github -&gt; webhook to bot -&gt; runs automation  like jekyll, gulp, grunt -&gt; deploys to DO
U04SM6T2H : works for node, php and static sites
U04SM6T2H : heh
U04U7PL2B : if you are okay deploying with not-a-bot, i've used dokku in the past and it works pretty okay
U04U7PL2B : <https://github.com/progrium/dokku>
U04SM6T2H : ah cool
U04SM6T2H : I have not yet wrapped my head around Docker
U04U7PL2B : i don't want to be like "you don't really need to!" but that's almost always a lie
U04U7PL2B : ...but you don't really need to
U04U7PL2B : oh right it's only one app per droplet though
U04SM6T2H : yeah for our thing there is a bit of config to do for each virtualhost
U04SM6T2H : so we can have lots of things running on each droplet
U04SM6T2H : but its 90% automatic
U04SM6T2H : I :heart: scripts
U05334HCE : <@U04U7PL2B>: dokku only works for one app per droplet, is that what you mean?
U05334HCE : because if so then I'm still in the same boat :disappointed:
U05334HCE : but thanks for the link!
U055FHACC : Hi everyone.. we had a crazy two days.. Massive traffic, 500% increase in signed up groups. If anything, this validates the whole concept for us. People love the robot more than any of our previous products, and you can see it on the support emails we get (usually themed as "I love this, can you please just add/fix this one thing")
U04SM6T2H : wow! that's awesome.
U055FHACC : Around noon (San Francisco time) yesterday, the load was too much and the Robot was timing out and eventually stopped responding.
U04SM6T2H : aww
U04SM6T2H : Are you running all the bots out of one big process?
U04SM6T2H : All of the instances
U055FHACC : <@U0563E81H>: , our CTO can tell you a bit more about this I guess. He did some hotfix to get us back online, but for sure if you're going primetime with your bot, you'd have to choose your load balancing solution carefully
U04SM6T2H : hehe
U04SM6T2H : yeah I'm sure!
U0563E81H : Indeed, big process, different thread polling on each websocket for the RTM
U04SM6T2H : In Node?
U0563E81H : Surprisingly it scales pretty well, since most of the time nothing serious happens (ping-pong etc)
U04SM6T2H : you guys can of course share only what you wnat! :simple_smile:
U0563E81H : Nope, python shop :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : ah cool
U0563E81H : we love sharing, it's what builds this eco-system.. nothing great comes out from hiding in a basement
U055FHACC : The responses are great. Stuff like "Slack game changer", or this one that just came in: <https://twitter.com/MariaJesusV/status/611550407932944384>
U0563E81H : except Google\Apple
U04SM6T2H : awesome
U04SM6T2H : We have seen pretty good ability to scale a single node process listening to lots and lots of streams
U055FHACC : I think everyone in this group can safely keep pursuing robot development as a career choice
U04S3JCH2 : :clap: <@U055FHACC> that's awesome
U04SM6T2H : but I feel like ther has to be some limit to the number of ports that it can have open
U04SM6T2H : woo!
U069GF9UY : NICE, congrats!
U055FHACC : BTW, where do you think would be a good place to find a writer for the robot's text? None of us is a native speaker, and we want him to have a well-defined character. The choice of words needs to be very accurate. I'm thinking we need someone who is a dialogue writer (screen writer?) of sorts.
U04SM6T2H : Matty, I might have a guy for you
U0563E81H : Ports are limited to about 65000, so even with reserving 3 for each team, it's still a pretty big scale for a single server. If you're over 20000 teams - congrats :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : heh
U04SM6T2H : 65000 per server?
U04SM6T2H : yeah
U04SM6T2H : that's plenty
U04SM6T2H : I knew there was SOME limit
U04SM6T2H : from my days 20 years ago at an ISP
U04SM6T2H : if you had a single process using 650000 ports, you would also be using like 2TB of ram
U04S2TZMU : <@U04SM6T2H>: I'd always planned to have a bunch of small servers, with intelligent fan-out done via HAProxy or Nginx.  Everybody comes in on the same port and gets directed to the appropriate port on the appropriate server based on hostname: <http://highlyfundedstartup.bensbotco.com:8080|highlyfundedstartup.bensbotco.com:8080> -&gt;[HAProxy routing] -&gt; <http://botco-32.atx-c.hostingfarm.com:4386|botco-32.atx-c.hostingfarm.com:4386>, <http://hobbiest.bensbotco.com:8080|hobbiest.bensbotco.com:8080> -&gt; [HAProxy routing] -&gt; <http://botco-12.atx-c.hostingfarm.com:7624|botco-12.atx-c.hostingfarm.com:7624>.
U05334HCE : <@U055FHACC>: having trouble getting other folks on board. how much is the utility of your scheduler nerfed if no one else gives calendar access to the bot?
U0554MQJB : Is anyone using slackin to host a public slack team? Is there an easy way to configure it to require admin approval for new users when people submit their email address?  <https://github.com/rauchg/slackin>
U068C6NPL : i use slackin but yeah the lack of approval is a problem
U068C6NPL : prevents me from listing a group publicly, which is the problem I was looking to solve
U05334HCE : <https://github.com/rauchg/slackin/issues/53>
U04SM6T2H : we use slackin for this team :simple_smile:
U05334HCE : <@U055FHACC>: see my question above, but also: how do I convince our corp security guys that you aren't going to pilfer our calendars for sensitive data &gt;_&gt;
U0554MQJB : <@U05334HCE>: thanks, looks like this will be a blocker for me
U0554MQJB : Found another good post on this, I may go the direction of using a Typeform signup page and python bot on the backend to buffer/process signup requests through an admin: <https://levels.io/slack-typeform-auto-invite-sign-ups/>
U04S3JCH2 : ^ whoa that's nifty
U06E352LU : I think this hack does not work anymore 
U0554MQJB : <@U06E352LU>: which part? looks like slackin uses the same api approach and it works: https://${org}.<http://slack.com/api/users.admin.invite|slack.com/api/users.admin.invite>
U06E352LU : I remeber seeing tweet of <http://levels.io|levels.io> complaining about something that was broken 
U06E352LU : But I might be wrong 
U055FHACC : <@U05334HCE>: You could use it w/out anyone else connected, but it'll be quite limited - you'll get "blind" meeting suggestions based on just your own availability info. Still, when you book a meeting, everyone will get invitations. Like a regular calendar I guess.In the neat future we will have more solo functionality, like "what does  Thursday looks like", or the more ambitious "clear my entire afternoon tomorrow"
About the privacy policy - we're actually rewriting it now based on user feedback. We're looking for feedback of the "I need it to say This and That specifically", we will go to great length to make corp security happy

U055FHACC : [sorry about the timezone lag...]
U05334HCE : <@U055FHACC>: no worries about lag! thanks for your response. unfortunately something like this would never take off in our company without "zero configuration". requiring individual setup by all 50+ participants makes it DOA for us. I hope this is valuable feedback for you.
U05334HCE : that said all employees have access to everyone's calendars. does gogole calendar ouath let your bot see calendars that are shared with me? if so, then a one-person setup could work.
U05560TFT : hey
U05560TFT : is there a way to export all my slack history if i'm not team admin/owner
U05560TFT : my meaning my personal history, not everyones forever
U04SR77Q1 : i was looking into this for another project, and the only way i could find to do it was to do a search for messages from your username, i.e. `from:@lee`
U05334HCE : word on the street is that <@U04S1QCPC> trades feature requests for beer and kittens
U069GF9UY : <http://i.imgur.com/dHNKo2G.jpg>
U055FHACC : <@U05334HCE>: we can have everyone connected in one go. will prob have it deployed by Monday. it's still a bit rough in the edges, so we need a sys admin with a little patience and, uhm, adventure spirit 
U05334HCE : keep us posted!
U055FHACC : it's two kittens there, I have a feature request too
U055FHACC : <@U05334HCE>: will do
U04SM6T2H : This is a callback to a while ago
U04SM6T2H : but this weekend I added “human like” typing delays to our bots
U04SM6T2H : so like, based on the length of the text,  it shows a “typing” indicator for longer or shorter
U04SM6T2H : p cool.
U04SM6T2H : it makes it feel much more “alive"
U069GF9UY : Awesome!
U04SM6T2H : of course it makes the bot running code that much more complex
U04SM6T2H : because it went from a sort of
U04SM6T2H : “is there a message? send a message"
U04SM6T2H : to a message queue
U04SM6T2H : with timestamps on every message
U04SM6T2H : that have to be set just at the right time
U069GF9UY : Wouldn't you want that anyway, for scaling?
U04SM6T2H : yeah
U04SM6T2H : for sure
U069GF9UY : So, your future self thanks you.
U069GF9UY : Nice job, you!
U069GF9UY : Thanks, me!
U04SM6T2H : hwh
U04SM6T2H : thanks!
U04SM6T2H : function calculateDelay(message) {
    if (message.text) {
      var words = message.text.split(/\s+/);
      var wpm = 180;
      var wps = (wpm / 60);
      var delay =  (words.length / wps)*1000;
      if (delay &gt; 4000) {
        delay = 4000;
      }

      return delay;

    } else {
      return 1500;
    }

  }

U04SM6T2H : there's my function :simple_smile:
U069GF9UY : I was just going to say, what was your sweet spot delay ;D
U04SM6T2H : its not a huge range
U04SM6T2H : robots can type fast :simple_smile:
U069GF9UY : Yeah, you really want just enough to give the illusion, but not enough that anyone's _actually_ waiting
U04SM6T2H : i think it makes more difference for the short messages
U069GF9UY : yeah, it's uncanny valley if it comes back too fast
U04SM6T2H : <@U068N43L6> scruot
U04SM6T2H : <@U068N43L6> script
U068N43L6 : These pretzels are making me thirsty.
U068N43L6 : Say interview or delays
U04SM6T2H : delays
U068N43L6 : This script demonstrates the human-like typing times based on text length.
U068N43L6 : The next few messages will appear in quick succession.
U068N43L6 : Because...
U068N43L6 : they are...
U068N43L6 : short!
U068N43L6 : Now, a long one:
U068N43L6 : Sometimes you have a lot to type and it just plain takes a long time. People know that you are saying something lengthy though because they can see that typing indicator, and they know something is coming!
U068N43L6 : A specific delay can also be specified in a script or via the API.
U068N43L6 : So yeah, pretty cool.
U04SM6T2H : voila
U069GF9UY : <http://media.giphy.com/media/SmsGyd7iwGL2o/giphy.gif>
U04SM6T2H : haha
U069GF9UY : that's perfect though.
U04S09GLN : <@U04SM6T2H>: awesome re: type delays. did my code come in handy, or did you do something totally different?
U04SM6T2H : you know I went looking for your code but couldn't find it for some reason
U04SM6T2H : slack searched failed me
U04S09GLN : oh, saw you ranswer
U04S09GLN : needed to read more
U04SM6T2H : yeah I basically did the same thing
U04SM6T2H : but with a max
U04SM6T2H : and not as elegantly :wink:
U04S09GLN : Max is a good idea
U04S09GLN : other funny extensions
U04S09GLN : simulating “pasting"
U04SM6T2H : yeah
U04S09GLN : for time-agnostic fast blobs
U04SM6T2H : i figured,  like, for a long “report"
U04SM6T2H : its just a paste
U04SM6T2H : robots type fast!
U04SM6T2H : or like, if the bot is responsding directly to a command
U04SM6T2H : @bot LUNCH
U04SM6T2H : it doesn't need to fake it
U04SM6T2H : the typeahead is to tell you the bot is ABOUT to say something
U04SM6T2H : and that you should wait
U04SM6T2H : fwiw I just hit the rate limit in my multi-channel bot
U04SM6T2H : oops.
U04SM6T2H : <https://api.slack.com/docs/rate-limits>
U04S09GLN : ooh, do tell. what was the limit?
U04SM6T2H : 1msg/second
U04SM6T2H : basically my multichannel bot hits it reliably if i try to message 3 people at a time
U04SM6T2H : <https://slack.com/>
U04SM6T2H : fancy new slack website :wink:
U04S1QCPC : new onboarding flow too! let us know what you think if you give it a try.
U04S3JCH2 : :thumbsup:
U04SM6T2H : coool
U04SM6T2H : next time I set up a new slack
U04SM6T2H : which will probably be what, a few days from now?
U04SM6T2H : sigh
U069GF9UY : Slack needs a partner program
U069GF9UY : <@U068N43L6> go fetch me a kitten for <@U04S1QCPC>
U04S1QCPC : what would you like to see from a partner program?
U069GF9UY : That's a mighty fine question, actually, I'm sure Ben has a ton of ideas.  For my company, something as simple as free slack usage would go a long way to figuring out integrations for clients.
U069GF9UY : Smooth admin flow to implement a full slack integration for a client with remote management
U053NQZN1 : <@U04S1QCPC> an official developer community or resource w/ rough a roadmap would be really useful. Some transparency into the API roadmap that is updated regularly. 
U053NQZN1 : Unfortunatley, the support people don't really know how to describe API features.  Would be great to have a dev relations person really own that at Slack and set the tone every week with a theme and update on the API.
U05560TFT : i think the title you are looking for is developer evangelist
U05334HCE : I feel like Slack is too agile to publish a roadmap
U05334HCE : I know it would never work for BandPage
U04S09GLN : <@U04S1QCPC> glad our logos still get to be on the homepage.
U04S09GLN : <@U069GF9UY> <@U04S1QCPC> on the topic of “free,” github has a pretty great edu program for giving free private repos to group accounts for schools. I'd love to see the same thing in Slack, as I switched over last fall to using it for all class communication outside of lectures.
U055FHACC : <@U04S1QCPC> The top request we get from our users is to allow the robot join their DM channel. I guess that's not easy to allow (even conceptually, having a 3rd party on the DM is not really DM anymore I guess), but maybe instead the robot can have power to open (and also later close) new private groups instead
U055FHACC : Also, the Robot auto-joining the <#C04SM6TAK> channel is annoying people sometimes. They would quietly install the robot to test how it works, and then it joins <#C04SM6TAK>, with the highest possible visibility and they get yelled at
U055FHACC : <@U04SM6T2H>: "Taskbot it typing" feels a little too slow for me. Also it feels natural when he says "Say _tasks_ to see your current todo list..." but somehow feels kludgy when he returns data (like the task list). I can't tell why that happens.For that I think I'd prefer a "Getting your data.." pause, if at all.

U055FHACC : Is it because it seems like the data is grabbed from somewhere, as opposed to being "typed"?
U04SR77Q1 : does anyone know of good javascript sentence generators? i want to be able to generate sentences like "Good job, you're really { verb }ing it today!" and supply a list of verbs and/or phrases. i know i found a perfect one about a month ago, but lost it in my weekly closing of old chrome tabs :disappointed:
U04SM6T2H : <@U055FHACC> good feedback
U04SM6T2H : i agree
U04SM6T2H : it only has a delay because that is the default behavior
U055FHACC : :thumbsup:
U04SM6T2H : putting it in more general terms, you'd say when a bot returns data or results of a command, it should happen immediately
U04SM6T2H : or as fast as possible
U04SM6T2H : ?
U055FHACC : I'm not sure about the speed. It just that the "Taskbot is typing" doesn't feel right for fetching data. It does work when the response has a conversational tone
U055FHACC : Look: Slack with a chrome extension to enable actions within Slack (but how will this work for the native apps?)<http://www.producthunt.com/tech/pubo-for-slack#discussion>

U04SM6T2H : I pooted out another post about bots!
U04SM6T2H : <https://medium.com/why-not/the-bot-stack-a44bca123ce6>
U04S09GLN : you are definitely prolific, Ben
U04SM6T2H : <@U04S09GLN>: i love bots! i can't help but keep writing about them
U069GF9UY : what if ben is actually a bot, you guys
U04SM6T2H : <@U069GF9UY>: you got me
U04TLHGSC : <@U04SM6T2H>: thanks for the blog posts
U04TLHGSC : <@U04SM6T2H>: you should rename it: “What is Bot?”
U04SM6T2H : heh
U04SM6T2H : you are welcome
U04SM6T2H : <https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution>
U04SM6T2H : that looks kinda neat
U055FHACC : Where do you dig those? How big is their user base, I wonder. I don't know anyone using Telegram
U04SM6T2H : neither do I
U04SM6T2H : i've never heard of it
U04SM6T2H : but they say they send 2B messages a day!
U04TLHGSC : Telegram is big
U04TLHGSC : <@U04S2TZMU>: is on it,
U04TLHGSC : and I guess most of my friends are, now that I think about it! They were the first to really own the security message.
U04S2TZMU : Heh. Haven't used it since Slack ate my life.
U04TLHGSC : :open_mouth:
U04TLHGSC : “I happen to have Greg Knauss right here”
U04S2TZMU : But their design goals are decentralization and security, so they say.
U04S2TZMU : But their code hasn't been reviewed, to my knowledge. They got a bunch of new users after WhatApp went to Facebook.
U04S2TZMU : I just follow you around, <@U04TLHGSC>, as your own private Kibo.
U04TLHGSC : :open_mouth:
U04TLHGSC : Promoting “Hot or Bot” is unusually tone deaf.
U04S2TZMU : Oof.
U04S2TZMU : Sorta hard to believe that Hot or Not was a thing. It's like the Internet from 1962.
U04TLHGSC : Or like, Facebook from… wait a second.
U06Q2D6TW : <@U04SM6T2H>: nice article on ‘bots' — it's how i found myself here
U04SM6T2H : :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : welcome
U04SM6T2H : thank you
U04SM6T2H : <@U06Q2D6TW>: are you building bots yourself?
U06Q2D6TW : not yet —
U06Q2D6TW : but i do like slack
U04SX1L23 : I've been building a bot for getting small graphic design tasks done—does this sound like something anyone would be interested in trying out? I'm looking to get some feedback on it. :simple_smile:
U04SX1L23 : Here's a demo of what it does for example.
U06Q2D6TW : <@U04SX1L23> does the bot create a new job in 99designs?
U04SX1L23 : Yep, that's right. :simple_smile: We've got a service for small design jobs: <http://99designs.com/tasks> .. happy to give you guys some freebies if you're interested in trying it out—I'd really appreciate the feedback.
U04SM6T2H : Whoa that's wild
U069GF9UY : that's great
U04S3JCH2 : welcome <@U06RQMZ8D>!
U06RQMZ8D : thank you! :smile:
U05676C84 : That service looks rad.
U05676C84 : Now I want one of those for Stack Overflow.
U05676C84 : "How do I know if an element is in an array in JavaScript?"
U05676C84 : if (array.indexOf(element) != -1) {
U05676C84 : And if it can't find the answer, it hires someone to program it for me.
U04SX1L23 : I'll probably open source my bot so teams can host it themselves—but I reckon it could be good to offer a hosted option to make it really easy for non-technical folks to use as well.
U04SX1L23 : Anyone have experience with running a hosted bot?
U04SM6T2H : matty does
U04SM6T2H : we're doing some too
U04SM6T2H : not at a huge scale yet
U04SX1L23 : Ah cool. Do you do it mostly to make installation easier? Or other reasons as well?
U04SM6T2H : yes
U04SM6T2H : both
U04SX1L23 : Haha cool :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : for lots of people cloning a repo and pushing to heroku is impossible
U04SM6T2H : so
U04SM6T2H : hosted is necessary
U04SX1L23 : Yeah, that's my thinking as well. Even one of those one-click heroku buttons still feels like it might be too hard.
U04SX1L23 : The UX of a hosted bot still seems to be slightly awkward.. you need to create a bot user and copy/paste API keys. Do you know if slack has plans to allow setting up bots automatically through the oauth api for example? That'd be pretty nice.
U04SM6T2H : I can't speak for them but i suspect so
U055FHACC : Slack just hired a new head of platform, She looks serious. I'm sure they will improve the entire bot on boarding 
U055FHACC : but meanwhile, every bot now counts as an integration, and we suddenly ran out of slots in our free plan
U04SM6T2H : <@U055FHACC>: you guys haven't upgraded yet?? 
U04TLHGSC : <@U055FHACC>: link to that announcement, please?
U04TLHGSC : Also, you can run bots as “bot users” right, which aren't integrations?
U04S3JCH2 : <@U04TLHGSC> I think he was talking about this
U04S3JCH2 : <https://twitter.com/aunder/status/613739933774270464>
U04S09GLN : Seriously, when is the Slack NY office going to exist?
U055FHACC : <@U04TLHGSC>: we have 4-5 robots active at any given time. They used to count as 1, but suddenly we passed the integration limit and can't add anything else
U055FHACC : <@U04SM6T2H>: trying to keep the burn rate as low as possible, and staying on free plans for as long as possible is part of it
U04SM6T2H : Omg how do you survive we have like 50 integrations
U04SM6T2H : GitHub and trello and ifttt and mail chimp 
U055FHACC : we have bitbucket, notify and twitter. and the bot bunch
U055FHACC : and we had one free slot for testing other things
U04SS2NBF : Happy Monday, everyone. I haven't mentioned this explicitly here, but I joined the product team at Slack about 3 weeks ago and am specifically focusing on building up the integrations experience for people like you. I just started <#C06V9K8JF> as a place to talk about how to make the Slack integration experience better for all developers. Join in if you have feedback!
U04SM6T2H : :simple_smile: :simple_smile: :simple_smile:
U04S3JCH2 : :thumbsup:
U04S4763Y : Over the weekend I came across <http://www.proximityevents.com/> which is an iOS app that can send a webhook based on location events (enter/exit a geofence, change locations, etc.). Not exactly Slack-related, but it might open up possibilities for writing something in the middle.
U04S4763Y : it doesn't look like you can modify the payload from the app itself, so you can't match up properties with what Slack expects
U05560TFT : <@U04S4763Y>: FYI if you have issues w/ that, there's also Geofency
U05560TFT : i use geofency for auto check ins to 4sq
U05560TFT : works v well
U04SM6T2H : cool
U04SM6T2H : I am big into this
U05560TFT : here's the script i use for automatic foursquare checkins if anyone wanted it
U05560TFT : <https://gist.github.com/robbiet480/a33924409ba9765c1103>
U05560TFT : apologies, it's php
U05560TFT : and apologies to the php developers in the room
U04SM6T2H : one of my wacky side projects is a bot app that does basically nothing besides say “Hey you are at home and it is lunch time, just thought I'd tell you that I noticed."
U05560TFT : haha
U05560TFT : spooky
U04SM6T2H : heh
U04SM6T2H : i figure my phone already knows these things
U04SM6T2H : might as well say them
U04SM6T2H : spookier that it knows these things nd NEVER mentions them
U06E352LU : can we get timezone/location of a user from slack API?
U04SM6T2H : oh man location
U06E352LU : ahah :stuck_out_tongue:
U06E352LU : trying to replicate the behavior when you do `@channel` “are you sure to send a message on # timezones"
U04S4763Y : <@U05560TFT>: Geofency looks good, for about the same price as Proximity Events (for the webhook in-app purchase). neat.
U0706A8RE : <@U04SM6T2H> thanks for the medium posts about building bots that integrate with slack!
U04SM6T2H : my pleasure
U0706A8RE : I'm more of a python/scala programmer but I hope to do something similar as I already use heroku and digitalocean for other stuff
U04SM6T2H : you are welcome
U070E9PPW : hello
U05676C84 : Anyone make a Slack bot that can schedule free time between people?
U05676C84 : Something like /calbot find free time for me and <@U04SM6T2H> to meet.
U05676C84 : Then it could DM out a Gcal link for us to both accept.
U04S4763Y : <@U05676C84>: <http://meekan.com/slack/>
U05676C84 : Nice!
U05676C84 : You use it?
U04S4763Y : nope, but it got a lot of attention last week.
U05676C84 : Cool cool.
U055FHACC : <@U06E352LU>:  Slack has a timezone setting on user's profile, but it's not always set correctly by default, and people don't bother to correct it (if they don't have a specific need to do it). So it may contain some weird stuff in there, and not always in touch with the real situation
U055FHACC : <@U05676C84>:  I'm the product designer at Meekan, and it does exactly what you asked for (and more..) [thanks for the mention <@U04S4763Y> ]
U0644KVQE : Folks, in case it's of interest I've been working on a ruby server for hosting multiple bots - designed with building service integrations in mind
U0644KVQE : I could find plenty of examples of running an individual bot connecting to my own team, but nothing that actually helped connect and manage multiple bots for multiple teams
U04SM6T2H : I'm sure peoplewould be interested!
U04SM6T2H : are you going to open source the code?
U071G1WPK : Hey everyone, just joined and interested in making slack bots. 
Any good ideas on where to start?

U0644KVQE : benbrown: that's the plan
U0644KVQE : In fact, here's it is: <https://github.com/exciting-io/slack-bot-server>
U0644KVQE : I still want to spend a little time looking at some of the solo bot implementations - I'm sure there's plenty to be learned and graciously stolen in terms of supporting implementing the interactions (i.e. the stuff that I've started to handle via `on_mention` and `on_im` hooks)
U04SM6T2H : I've built a lot of that same kind of stuff for node
U0644KVQE : I'd be quite surprised if you hadn't :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : <@U0644KVQE>: are you <@U0644KVQE> on twitter
U0644KVQE : I am
U04SM6T2H : twooted!
U0644KVQE : Thanks for the twort!
U04SM6T2H : heh
U0644KVQE : Building this has raised a few interesting questions for me about slack bots
U0644KVQE : like… is it more or less natural to use a slash command, or IM/mention a bot?
U04SM6T2H : yeah
U04SM6T2H : I have started to prefer @bot mentions instead of slash commands
U04SM6T2H : personally
U04SM6T2H : slash commands are great for people who come from an IRC background
U04SM6T2H : but “talking” to someone feels more natural to me
U0644KVQE : I find myself gravitating towards slash commands but I strongly suspect that's because I'm a developer and so find it easier to “trust” things that seem more like commands
U04SM6T2H : it is an interesting question
U04SM6T2H : i was ranting at <@U04SS2NBF> about it yesterday in the <#C06V9K8JF> channel
U04SM6T2H : I just really like being able to do
U04SM6T2H : <@U0614LL8Y> + do stuff
U0644KVQE : I hope they do make it easier for “us” to manage setting up the integration in the user's Slack instance
U0614LL8Y : Hey, I'm here to help collect tasks! Say _tasks_ to see a list, or say <@taskbot> + _new task_ to add one.
U04SM6T2H : <@U0614LL8Y> + do stuff
U0614LL8Y : Added a task for <@U04SM6T2H>
U04SM6T2H : there we go :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : <@U0644KVQE>: they've said as much
U0644KVQE : I think the other frontier in terms of service integration implementation is building robust ways to model conversations
U0644KVQE : Without wishing to invoke handwaving wishy-washy futurism talk, it's edging closer to AI style development
U04SM6T2H : I concur
U04SM6T2H : that is where most of our dev efforts are focused now
U04SM6T2H : conversational ui is a whole tricky beast of its own
U0644KVQE : like, my bot Harmonia says “James Adam has been assigned a task!”, and then if I say “@harmonia done”, the bot needs to look at what it knows about my team, who I am in Slack vs who I am in the app, and then what task I might've been refering to, before it can actually do something concrete
U04SM6T2H : yeah
U04SM6T2H : and even things like
U04SM6T2H : the bot ssays “Say yes or no to continue"
U04SM6T2H : what if the user says “blort"
U04SM6T2H : it needs to nicely lead them
U04SM6T2H : <http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/dravling/grice.html>
U0644KVQE : For other integrations I've build (like Trello), I've had to get users to fill in some of the mapping between the service and my app, but with something like Slack, there's an interesting opportunity to make the bot “learn” (in the weakest sense) about how the two apps relate in a gradual way
U0644KVQE : So when I say “@harmonia done”, and the bot doesn't know who I am in Harmonia, it might open a DM at that point and say “Oh hello there. Before I can mark your task as done, I need to know a little more about you. I'm guessing that you're &lt;james@lazyatom.com&gt; in Harmonia - is that right?"
U0644KVQE : and so on - building up the mapping by asking questions at the last minute
U04SM6T2H : totally
U04SM6T2H : and lest we get too far ahead, imagine the scenario when that bot has to ask you several questions like that
U0644KVQE : It could be that it's actually a terrible way to build the service - it'd depend on how adept people are with Slack
U04SM6T2H : and get queued up
U04SM6T2H : while you are away at lunch
U04SM6T2H : :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : That ^^ is a semi-canonical guide to building conversational uis
U04SM6T2H : from the 90s!!
U0644KVQE : Interesting stuff!
U06U57P6E : <@U0644KVQE>: <https://github.com/exciting-io/slack-bot-server> looks awesome, I had just opened <https://github.com/aki017/slack-ruby-gem/issues/34> which basically says “build this” - I might try to turn <https://github.com/dblock/slack-mathbot> into something that uses this unless you want to help :simple_smile:
U0644KVQE : Happy to help/advise in any day, <@U06U57P6E> :simple_smile:
U0644KVQE : I'm sure you'll hit a lot of “wait, I need this feature and it's not available yet” bumps
U06U57P6E : I am wondering whether this should be the default for slack-ruby-api, ie. that already has an interface for the messages/new user, etc., so it feels like you're adding an interface on top that replicates that, with different parameters
U0644KVQE : Like, for example, at the moment the ‘mentions' assume that the mention keyword is the same as the bot username, which isn't the case for your bot
U055FHACC : What do you think is a good way to replace modal dialogues? let's say the robot asks a yes/no question, but you missed it, came back a few hours later to assign him a new mission, but he's still expecting a yes/no
U055FHACC : so needs to somehow transition nicely from giving up on the idea to get his yes/no into doing a task again
U04SM6T2H : time out
U04SM6T2H : but yeah
U04SM6T2H : we kinda have a default route
U04SM6T2H : that proceeds if none of the expected answers happen
U04SM6T2H : sometimes it loops back
U04SM6T2H : sometimes it gives up
U04SM6T2H : depends
U04SM6T2H : but we are planning our apps as like, giant conversation trees
U04SM6T2H : that crisscross back and forth
U055FHACC : but what's a good time out? this is a chat app. sometimes people go in a meeting and come back to continue right where they stopped
U071MP677 : I'll add my voice and say that my team much prefers to @mention the bot, to the point where people will mention <@USLACKBOT> for trigger words because it's pure muscle memory
U071MP677 : I think the tab-complete is a big reason for that
U04SS2NBF : Do you think `/taskbot + get an oil change` and `@taskbot + get an oil change` should behave the same way, or should there be differences? Slash commands have the expectation of a limited syntax, whereas @-mentioning a bot makes you think you can maybe just say anything to it. Thoughts?
U071MP677 : I would expect the @mention to possibly come back with a followup question, while a slash command would either fail or work per the syntax
U04SS2NBF : so it might reply with `Usage: <@U0614LL8Y> + new task blah blah` … still command-line-y in a way.
U055FHACC : we didn't go with slash commands just because we needed the conversation to be as visible as possible
U0728MNBC : evening
U0728MNBC : I'm just a little curious about this pmbot you have an article written on
U0728MNBC : <https://medium.com/why-not/can-a-bot-help-you-at-your-job-8b1b13d7ed8>
U0728MNBC : I'm trying to get an understanding of where hubot stops and slack bots begin
U0644KVQE : Possibly simple question - what determines which channel a bot will join by default?
U04S3JCH2 : <@U0728MNBC>: I'm working on that pmbot - what would you like to know about it?
U0728MNBC : i'm just curious about the implementation and from what I found out from <@U04SM6T2H> was that there's a pricetag on it as well
U0728MNBC : just curious about the details as it wasn't that clear in the article
U04S3JCH2 : the implementation is really easy. you just give us API token and we turn it on.
U04S3JCH2 : we're still working on it though; haven't yet decided when or how to release it.
U0728MNBC : you have a price point yet?
U04S3JCH2 : not quite.
U0728MNBC : talking with benbrown about it now
U055FHACC : Just in case you missed this: <https://twitter.com/sarahoconnor_/status/616282747200479232>
U0563E81H : <@U0644KVQE>: It's the default channels setting here: <http://slack.com/admin/settings#default_channels>
U04SS2NBF : Impressively full-featured task list management integration: <https://twitter.com/revdancatt/status/616595813431681024> (does anyone know Rev Dan Catt?)
U04SM6T2H : cool
U04SM6T2H : I read his blog!
U0644KVQE : <@U04SS2NBF>: I'm loosely connected to him (friend of a friend)
U0644KVQE : <@U0563E81H> - thanks - I'm not sure that's quite what I mean. I'd like my bot to initially connect to a channel that's *not* ‘#general'
U04SS2NBF : <@U0644KVQE>: wanna invite him here? 
U04SS2NBF : And yeah, I totally get why bots joining #general automatically can be strange. I'll add that to our list of stuff to fix. 
U0563E81H : :thumbsup:
U0563E81H : You can't control which groups your bot joins :disappointed: (here are the limited methods you can call as a bot: <https://api.slack.com/bot-users>)
U071MP677 : In the Slack settings, you can define what rooms to shove that bot into
U071MP677 : Oh, I stand corrected. Have to invite it
U0644KVQE : Thanks <@U04SS2NBF>!
U04SS2NBF : They're like vampires. 
U04SM6T2H :  Hi <@U074YESKX> and <@U074YE473> 
U074YE473 : Hola!
U074YESKX : Hi <@U04SM6T2H> great to be here!
U04S3JCH2 : :wave:
U0644KVQE : <@U04SS2NBF> what's the rationale for not allowing bot users to call the `channels.leave` api method?
U04SS2NBF : I'm not aware of the reason. Probably just because it was grouped with joining channels… stuff that people should do on behalf of bots. But it probably makes sense to allow them to leave a channel.
U0644KVQE : Ah, I see. Yeah, I can imagine that was a simple initial choice.
U04SS2NBF : I'll add it to my list of methods we should revisit for bots. Feel free to add any other thoughts along those lines my way.
U0644KVQE : My hunch is that the need would probably be subsumed by the ability to pick a channel to connect to as part of the initial handshake
U04SS2NBF : What if it didn't auto-join any channels but could be invited to any?
U04SM6T2H : :thumbsup:
U0644KVQE : I'm not sure users would expect to have to /invite a bot from the outset. Maybe a default channel could be specified at the same time they create the bot integration and get the token?
U04SM6T2H : User clicks "add to slack" -&gt; slack auth screen -&gt; confirm. In slack a DM from bot is sent to user. "Invite me to the channel, etc"
U04SM6T2H : <@U04SJBP5Q>: yo
U04SJBP5Q : Oh yeah?
U04S1QCPC : hello from another spy from slackhq! we're curating any interesting slack api-related posts into a flipboard magazine (see the general slack one here: <https://flipboard.com/@slackhq/several-people-are-reading...-bu69vk0ez>); if you've written any sort of post about your slack bot/integrations/company and want it to be included, please DM it to me!
(oh and happy 4th! :fireworks: :us: :boom:)

U04SM6T2H : <https://medium.com/@julianmartinez/how-to-write-a-slack-bot-end-to-end-d6a8542c854b>
U055FHACC : What's going on? There is a huge tectonic movement in the robot lands. Hipchat, Telegram, Amazon Alexa/Echo, and some more probably going on under the surface
U055FHACC : <@U04SM6T2H>: you might need to consider renaming this group
U06E352LU : hey <@U04S1QCPC> you can add <https://docs.apitools.com/blog/2015/04/08/air-quality-bot-for-slack-with-breezometer-.html>
<https://docs.apitools.com/blog/2015/01/15/a-slack-bot-without-a-server.html>

U06UZ1RKQ : quick question how would you go about building something like? <http://taylorbot.com/> Do you know some lib that can chat like that?
U06V2MS5Q : <@U06UZ1RKQ>:  I've buit something similar. The way I did it, I just kept track of the conversation via steps (step 1, step 2, etc.) and used Slack slash commands
U06V2MS5Q : Update your model after each step with the text that is sent.
U04S3JCH2 : There's a good chance that kind of chat service is human-assisted
U06UZ1RKQ : <@U06V2MS5Q>: sorry but I didnt follow
U06UZ1RKQ : <@U04S3JCH2>: that is what I thought
U06UZ1RKQ : but was not sure
U06V2MS5Q : <@U06UZ1RKQ>: I keep track of the user's conversation with the bot via their Slack user ID. The bot will ask the first question and then the user will respond. I update that conversation in my DB with the user's response. Then based on that response, the bot will ask another question and record that response in the DB with the user's response again. Once the bot has asked a series of questions and recorded the responses, the bot does what ever functionality you want it to do (API requests, google searches, etc.). After the bot responds with the final answer/solution the user is looking for, the bot just updates that converstation/record in the DB to say that it is complete. The next time that Slack user ID initiates the slash command for that bot, the whole process starts over again because the last "converstation" is marked as complete in the DB.
U06V2MS5Q : It might not be the solution your looking for…depending on how in depth you want the conversation to get with the user
U06UZ1RKQ : i see. basically the bot was not really able to chat right? It's still interesting
U06UZ1RKQ : what kind of bot didi you build?
U04SM6T2H : <@U06UZ1RKQ>: you might want to look at this
U04SM6T2H : <http://superscriptjs.com/>
U04SM6T2H : that is more sophisticated AI
U06UZ1RKQ : that's lovely!
U06UZ1RKQ : anyone had any experience with it?
U04SM6T2H : not personally
U06UZ1RKQ : ben, what interesting things have you build?
U04SM6T2H : we're working on a few things, you can read a lot about our projects on medium
U04SM6T2H : <https://medium.com/@benbrown>
U04SM6T2H : we
U04SM6T2H : we're building pretty complex bots using Node and the Real time api
U04SM6T2H : that do things like <@U06V2MS5Q> was describing - back and forth conversations with users
U06UZ1RKQ : i like bots a lot but the only thing a built was using a hubot with some custom commands to help at work.
U06V2MS5Q : <@U04SM6T2H>: in your applications, do you tend to use slash commands for back &amp; forth conversation or do you use incoming/outgoing webhooks?
U04SM6T2H : I use the real time api
U04SM6T2H : a lot of the times our bots are triggered by a specific keyword or direct mention
U04SM6T2H : but then they go into like “promiscuous listening mode"
U04SM6T2H : where they listen to all the messages
U04SM6T2H : in order to accept a response without having to prefix it with acommand
U06UZ1RKQ : last night finally built something useful
U06UZ1RKQ : a friend of mine looks for online ads selling iphones with broken screens
U06UZ1RKQ : he then replaces the screen to sell and make some profit
U06UZ1RKQ : so the bot does that for him, crawl a portuguese online ad website and extracts the last ads matching certain queries
U05676C84 : Anyone else running into a situation where the Slack OSX client runs at 5 frames a second?
U0644KVQE : I haven't seen that, but it sounds very frustrating!
U06E352LU : nice tool today for digest on slack: <https://atomicslack.com> by <https://twitter.com/nottil> and <https://twitter.com/miles_matthias>
U07BDQS4S : <@U06E352LU> that's a really cool idea, especially the way it links in with starred messages. Definitely lots of potential use cases
U0644KVQE : Anyone else experienced any problems including attachments in their bot chat messages? No attachment that I send ever seems to appear
U04SX1L23 : Are you using the rtm api?
U04SX1L23 : I don't think the rtm api supports the full set of formatting options. Let me double check that..
U04SX1L23 : _"The RTM API only supports posting simple messages formatted using our default message formatting mode. It does not support attachments or other message formatting modes."_ — <https://api.slack.com/rtm>
U04SX1L23 : You might need the <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage> api instead.
U0644KVQE : Interesting.
U0644KVQE : I *think* I'm actually posting via the web API even though I'm also connected to the RTM API at the same time
U04SX1L23 : Ah right, are you using the node library?
U0644KVQE : I'm using <https://github.com/exciting-io/slack-bot-server> (which I wrote) on top of the ruby `slack-api` gem
U04SX1L23 : Here's an example of my bot with two ways of sending a message: <https://github.com/99designs/tasks-slack-bot/blob/master/lib/bot.js#L35-51>
U04SX1L23 : I had to dig into the source code a little bit to figure out which was which.
U0644KVQE : Ah - I'm definitely sending via the ruby equivalent of your `replyFormatted`
U0644KVQE : (as opposed to sending some text back through the websocket)
U04SX1L23 : The node API has `send` as well as `postMessage`
U0644KVQE : I read somewhere that the `as_user` flag was important, but even adding that didn't seem to work
U04SX1L23 : Yep, I remember something about this. I've included it in my code.. so I think it must've been important. Let me check. :simple_smile:
U0644KVQE : Here's what I'm running to test locally, as the simplest case:
U0644KVQE : It works, but all I see in the chat room is the text (‘testing'), and no attachment
U04SX1L23 : Maybe try some formatted text to see if that's the issue? e.g. `&lt;link|http://google.com&gt;`
U0644KVQE : the link gets formatted and does some unfurling (incidentally it's &lt;http://google.com|link&gt;), but still no attachment
U04SX1L23 : ok cool, so it sounds like you're definitely using the web api.
U04SX1L23 : Ah so the `fallback` field might be required.
U0644KVQE : tried it; still no dice :disappointed:
U0644KVQE : (I really appreciate your time btw!)
U04SX1L23 : Yeah, seems weird. Maybe try fill out some of the other fields?
U04SX1L23 : (no problem btw!) :stuck_out_tongue:
U04SX1L23 : I haven't played with attachments very much yet, so curious to know how it works out for you.
U0563E81H : <@U0644KVQE>: I think you had to send the attachments json as a string.
U0644KVQE : Eureka! Thanks <@U0563E81H>.
U0563E81H : :thumbsup::skin-tone-5:
U04SM6T2H : That one gets me every time
U0644KVQE : Is there any sensible reason that it's not actually just the raw parameters?
U0644KVQE : folks, I'd love some feedback on my bot message formatting if anyone has a spare second?
U04S3JCH2 : sure!
U0644KVQE : For background, my app (Harmonia) deals with team task assignment. I'm notifying the team in their room that an assignment has been made, and providing them with a few ‘action' links to act on that task
U0644KVQE : Those are the four basic versions I've been considering
U04SM6T2H : the more verbose ones might be good in a DM
U04SM6T2H : the shorter ones better in a channel
U04SM6T2H : and action buttons at bottom
U04S3JCH2 : the “show more…” and “Assigned to” are a little cluttered in there
U04S3JCH2 : agree on the action buttons being on the bottom makes sense
U0644KVQE : Yeah, agreed about the cluttered - unfortunately that's Slack's layout rather than anything I can control (it adds the ‘show more' when it truncates the text)
U04S3JCH2 : looks good though! we have also been working on a taskbot over here.
U04S3JCH2 : I tend to manage my tasks in a DM with the bot, rather than in the channels.
U04SM6T2H : <@U04S1QCPC> <@U04SS2NBF> I hate you guys
U04SM6T2H : We are BUSY working!
U04S3JCH2 : my biggest frustration with using it is that the task management really clutters up the channel, especially when you are using it more than other team members.
U04SM6T2H : and do not need more ways to use emojis!!!!!
U04SM6T2H : heh
U04S1QCPC : i will preempt everyone's post-excitement question and answer: yes, an official api for reactions will happen.
U04SM6T2H : haha
U04S0AG48 : <@U04SM6T2H>: Now we know which one you voted for.
U04SM6T2H : gotta keep the burn rate down
U0644KVQE : <@U04S3JCH2>: yeah, clutter is a concern, although part of the design of this app is that the whole team should have visibility of assignments (it's about shared responsibility, rather than ‘oh, here's a task I just remembered and need to capture')
U04S3JCH2 : yeah. we have channel notifications when tasks have been completed, but since I'm the only one who really uses it, it just looks like I'm showing off my productivity all the time :wink:
U04S3JCH2 : patting myself on the back and cluttering the project channels
U05676C84 : Wow those lil "vote" emojis are neat.
U04SM6T2H : :simple_smile:
U05676C84 : Wait how do you add one?
U05676C84 : For fear of Slack becoming FB, having a "like" button on a post seems really helpful, especially in our company where 500 people are in a channel and it gets REALLY tiring of seeing "me too" several dozen times.
U07060PG9 : I think the first one has to be added via the Message Gear box when you hover over.
U07060PG9 : then subsequent ones can be added via the + symbol
U04SM6T2H : no yuou can +:fire: from the first
U07060PG9 : oh so you don't have to go into the gear box at all?
U05676C84 : So what would I type in to the chat bar to have a reaction appear automatically?
U04SM6T2H : “+:fire:
U04SM6T2H : &gt; + :EMOJI:
U05676C84 : This just a test. +:thumbsup: +:thumbsdown:
U05676C84 : Didn't work. :stuck_out_tongue:
U07060PG9 : I see Ben - thanks for the tip!
U04SM6T2H : no sorry as the next message
U04SM6T2H : so you send it
U04SM6T2H : then you + it up with icons
U05676C84 : This just another test.
U05676C84 : +:thumbsup: +:thumbsdown:
U05676C84 : Still didn't work.
U05676C84 : Patrick is dense and will keep trying.
U04SM6T2H : DANG
U04SM6T2H : racist emoji reactions
U05676C84 : Fuck.
U05676C84 : Stop typing while I'm typing, Ben. :stuck_out_tongue:
U04SM6T2H : black people are emoji too
U04SM6T2H : <http://interconnected.org/home/2015/06/28/more_on_conversational_uis>
U04SM6T2H : tons of great stuff in there from Matt WEbb
U053NQZN1 : Man, I love* this Reaction thing  




*not really

U04S09GLN : <@U04S1QCPC> REACTIONS yay.
U055FHACC : Is it already supported in the API too? (counting the reactions)
U055FHACC : oh already been answered
U06TP9FNJ : Test 
U06TP9FNJ : This :shit: or that :wine_glass:
U06UZ1RKQ : yesterday, i started working on a price monitor for a certain site here in Portugal. is mostly just a module for hubot but it will probably be handy
U04S1QCPC : here we go: <https://twitter.com/SlackAPI/status/619585025529376769>
U04SM6T2H : nooice
U04S4763Y : yup. and now to come up with a zany ideas on how to use them in my existing bots.
U04SS2NBF : This one might also be useful for bots in particular: <https://api.slack.com/events/reaction_added>
U04SS2NBF : So you could get responses to questions without having to remember too much state. ie “React with :one: for option 1, :two: for option two” etc.
U04SM6T2H : cooooool
U07060PG9 : updated some of our prompts to use reactions based on that event and it's worked out well. :+1:
U04SM6T2H : wow that was fast!
U07060PG9 : Only trick is that they can add multiple and remove some after the fact.  So just a bit more state to take into account.  All in the name of more expression though
U07060PG9 : <@U04SM6T2H>: only used the reaction_added event so far. Tons more to explore.
U04SS2NBF : there's a <https://api.slack.com/events/reaction_removed> event too if you want to use that
U04SM6T2H : I'm just gonna make a bot that adds a thumbsdown to every single message
U04SM6T2H : everythingsucksbot
U04SM6T2H : annoying_as_hell_gets_booted_immediately_bot
U07060PG9 : negbot
U04SM6T2H : yesssss
U04SM6T2H : We had a slackbot macro configured that if any said “Can I ___?"
U07060PG9 : Exciting to be able to express lightweight responses to people through this, though.  Just some nice “I hear you” / recognition that the bot understands you.
U04SM6T2H : it would just say NO!!!!
U04SM6T2H : <@U07060PG9> totes!
U04SM6T2H : like I could see it used to track progress on a deploy or somethign too
U04SM6T2H : @bot deploy code!
U04S1QCPC : pollbot using reactions would be pretty sweet.
U07060PG9 : <@U04SM6T2H>: yep it could add the build status as reactions.  Love it.
U04SM6T2H : even add/remove as necssary to show status
U04SM6T2H : even just using them as action buttons could be fun
U04SM6T2H : bot says
U04SM6T2H : liek
U04SM6T2H : A new image was uploaded!
U04SM6T2H : and hten whatever reaction gets clicked triggers a moderation operation
U04SM6T2H : ANYHOO
U04T87ZQH : <https://twitter.com/SlackAPI/status/619585025529376769>
U04T87ZQH : reactions in the API!
U04S4763Y : maybe reactions is what I use as the RT button on tweets in the Twitter client I built. hmm.
U04T87ZQH : Yeah, that was my plan for the Twitter hacks we have in place to run @SlackLoveTweets
U04T87ZQH : right now we have a custom slash command, which I've automated with TextExpander to the point where it's just a two character typing, but I would love to turn it into just if special reaction is clicked, grep the post for a twitter ID and RT away.
U04T87ZQH : (perhaps recycle symbol = RT tweet in that message)
U04S4763Y : exactly. that's how I do starring-as-faving
U04S4763Y : (which, incidentally, required a patch that I got committed to the Node.js library)
U04S09GLN : Could use reactions to emulate multiple keys turned at the same time to launch a missile, except for code deployment
U04T87ZQH : CI and CD in a single button, nice.
U04SS2NBF : Does anyone here have a simple incoming webhook integration and want to work with us to test a new thing we're building (hopefully ready by end of next week)? If so, DM and tell me about what your incoming webhook does. (Right now it needs to be fairly stand alone and not connected to the RTM API or slash commands or other integration types)
U055FHACC : How quick is the adoption rate for new Slack features? Should we add an explanation for now? something like
U055FHACC : Use these buttons to vote:
U055FHACC : .. also, do you think they should actually start with a "0" (If I added them myself, doesn't mean that I vote for them, I'm just putting them there for consideration)
U06RQMZ8D : I think it's pretty quick, most Slacks I'm in are already using that reply emoji feature
U06E352LU : wowo thats awesome!!
U05676C84 : Can you add a reaction icon with a default 0-vote value to it?
U055FHACC : you can't, I think it would make sense to start with a "0", if they were added by me (If someone else adds a reaction to my line, then it makes more sense to start it with a "1" already)
U04S09GLN : <@U055FHACC>: that was quick!
U04S09GLN : re: implementing reaction usage.
U055FHACC : a little bug there.. the apps and the mobile versions show the reactions in a different order..
U055FHACC : <@U04S09GLN>: we were really waiting for something along this line. When it showed up we just put everything else on hold
U07HXFWUD : <@U055FHACC>: your multiple choice menu there - do people have to hit return or is there a way to just pick up a single keypress?
U07HXFWUD : does slack realtime API feed events through as they're typed?
U04SM6T2H : I am giving a talk here in austin tomorrow night about bots
U04SM6T2H : and i'm doing some research
U04SM6T2H : and just remembered this gem
U04SM6T2H : <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GooglyMinotaur>
U04SM6T2H : Radiohead had an AIM bot
U04SM6T2H : and it had the word google in it
U04SM6T2H : exchanged 60 million messages!
U055FHACC : <@U07HXFWUD>: yes it picks up single clicks (and a second click undos the first if you change your mind). If the robot detects a unanimous vote on an option, he books it automatically, so sometimes the whole transaction would end with no text exchanged
U07HXFWUD : i found this confusing at first as it has `[1] 2`
U07HXFWUD : the number of clicks next to the icon
U07HXFWUD : :a: :b: choices maybe better?
U07HXFWUD : <@U055FHACC>: is there an API to get that info back from slack? number of clicks on emoji reactions? i'm wondering how that would work since it changes over time.
U07HXFWUD : shame there's no `:c:`
U07HXFWUD : tho we could do basic polling with :thumbsup: :thumbsdown:
U055FHACC : gotta ask <@U0563E81H> he's the code brain. I just do the emails
U0563E81H : <@U07HXFWUD> There's an API to get all reactions on an item. <https://api.slack.com/methods/reactions.get> . But we're using the RTM, so we're getting a notification on each reaction live as it happens.
U04SM6T2H : Hey folks, thought I'd share this video of my talk “Your friendly robot companions” from Refresh Austin last night:
U04SM6T2H : <https://vimeo.com/133520585>
U04SM6T2H : its all about bots!
U04SM6T2H : and bot history
U06RQMZ8D : <@U04SM6T2H>: can I tweet this?
U04SM6T2H : <@U06RQMZ8D>: Let me update the meta data first :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : welcome <@U07M21QKS>
U04S4763Y : <@U04SM6T2H>: OK if I tweet it now?
U04SM6T2H : no sorry
U04S3JCH2 : I was responsible for filming that, and I apologize for filming in portrait - I will never do it again
U04SM6T2H : just let me put some links on there! :simple_smile:
U04S4763Y : <@U04S3JCH2>: it feels like I'm watching a Periscope
U04S3JCH2 : well, great :simple_smile:
U04S4763Y : oh wow, the first 10 seconds of the ActiveBuddy launch video reminds me of the “your business card is crap” video
U04SM6T2H : I cna't get enough of that video
U04SM6T2H : <https://medium.com/why-not/your-friendly-robot-companions-b2d39e71dfcb>
U04SM6T2H : ok!
U04SM6T2H : there's the video + the slides + all the links in one place!
U04S09GLN : totally unrelated, we finally released our slack slash-command-creation library
U04S09GLN : <https://github.com/dowjones/slack-slash>
U04S09GLN : With sample JIRA plugin: <https://github.com/dowjones/slack-slash-jira>
U04S09GLN : <@U04SM6T2H>: “Does this mean we can finally cancel Creative Cloud.” Nice one.
U04SM6T2H : hehe
U04SX1L23 : I thought this article was pretty interesting: <https://publicintelligence.net/tactical-chat/> (from 2013)
U0554MQJB : "Tactical chat" is an amazing phrase
U0554MQJB : I'm imagining the president and a general turning launch keys via emoji reactions
U04SM6T2H : YEt another reason to love Slack
U04SM6T2H : there are pigs and chickens crawling all over my screen now!!
U06E352LU : been on this page few times..
U06E352LU : but konami code does not do much :disappointed:
U07K5QQDN : I so miss Glitch (also miss Game Never Ending - I've never looked at paper the same way since)
U07K5QQDN : The 404 on Slack has me wanting to milk the butterflies.
U04S4763Y : I never looked at chickens the same way since Glitch.
U07HXFWUD : what are some good examples of “chat apps” (or graphical chat interfaces) people have seen?
U07HXFWUD : eg like lark, <http://luka.ai|luka.ai>, vida health …
U07HXFWUD : blending chat with graphs, choices, other widgets in the chat stream
U04S3JCH2 : Snapchat is doing a bunch of crazy brand stuff, Kik, WhatsApp all have interesting stuff inside messaging environments
U04S3JCH2 : Worth downloading and exploring if you're curious about these things
U04SM6T2H : <@U07HXFWUD> also things like magic
U04SM6T2H : which is txting based
U04SM6T2H : <http://www.producthunt.com/tech/nestor>
U04SM6T2H : That launched today
U04SM6T2H : I tried to add it to my team and it claimed it was too busy
U04SM6T2H : oh its working now
U04SM6T2H : Bots need to introduce themselves and announce their intentions.
U04SM6T2H : And also like, respond to the keyword “help"
U04SS2NBF : can you write the bot etiquette manual :simple_smile:
U04SM6K6N : _[bot name] tips hat/curtsies_
U07PWBFQB : :wave:
U04SX1L23 : Hello. :simple_smile:
U04SX1L23 : Anyone know if there was any further news on the slack:// style urls mentioned in the latest changelog?
U07QEB3HQ : Hi Everyone, I am new here;) Interested to learn and contribute with my experience in using bots with the team @stageflock.com.
U07HXFWUD : what bots do you have there? <@U07QEB3HQ>
U04SS2NBF : Hey all. We just added a new “Getting Started” page on <http://api.slack.com|api.slack.com> and would love your opinions on if it's useful, obvious, or could be improved. Put on your “I just heard about Slack's API and have no idea what any of these words mean” hat: <https://api.slack.com/getting-started>
U04SM6T2H : <@U04SS2NBF> i think its great
U04SM6T2H : a good summary without too much detail
U04SM6T2H : and focusing on use cases :thumbsup:
U04S09GLN : I love Celeste's 2nd message
U04S09GLN : Like, it is either implying that you're in a 1-on-1 chat with officebot, which is nice.
U04S09GLN : Or it is implying that the bot is also just in general listening to conversations, and has some smarts that it knows you're referring to it still, despite not @-ing it.
U04S09GLN : Or it is implying that the bot has been invited into the channel, which implies its own functionality.
U04S09GLN : The point is, I like that such a simple screenshot can convey such a varied set of circumstances.
U06E352LU : awesome doc :wink:
U06U57P6E : <@U04SS2NBF>: could be a good place to highlight examples, so maybe 'for example this bot reticulates splines ...' With a link to source code.
U04SS2NBF : Totally! Soon I'd love to do an overhaul to the community page (<https://api.slack.com/community>) and include a better way to keep that updated with useful community resources and reference apps.
U06U57P6E : I bet the number 1 gripe is how to get on that list. I want to suggest a reddit style system where anyone can post but the default sort is by popularity. Ideally it would be automatic as slack should be able to know which bots are most used server side (maybe there needs to be a way to sign bot identity?).
U04SS2NBF : Yeah, that's definitely something we're working towards. :) 
U07HXFWUD : can someone explain how the subcurrent pollbot is getting multiple links into a message?
U07HXFWUD : each of those 3 links ( yes/no/maybe ) go to unique URLs
U07HXFWUD : <https://www.getsubcurrent.com/slackvote/XXXX&amp;vote=1>
U07HXFWUD : etc
U07HXFWUD : i didn:t think you could send html content?
U07HXFWUD : oooh, i think I get it. they're building a web page, and posting a link to that page, and letting slack unfurl that page with the links in?
U07HQL693 : <@U07HXFWUD>: it might be `&lt;http://google.com|google&gt;` - <https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks>
U04SM6T2H : <@U07HXFWUD>: you can do that with attachments or as <@U07HQL693> said
U07HQL693 : I'm creating a custom slash command and having some issues with how my response is being formatted on the Slack iOS app. Here's an example of my text response:
U07HQL693 : ```• Doing• Done
```
/fg VL3

U07HXFWUD : is there a way in the api to “whisper” to someone?
U07HXFWUD : ie like the bots do
U07HXFWUD : just want one user to see the info
U07HXFWUD : <@U07HQL693>: that looks cool. are you going to make those selectable?
U07HQL693 : <@U07HXFWUD>:  I like that idea! Right now they are links. Still trying to figure out what is possible with slash commands.
U07HXFWUD : i wasn:t sure if you can use links in popups on ios
U07HQL693 : <@U07HXFWUD>: The links are definitely not working on iOS and the formatting is all wonky. I have a lot to learn with how to format properly for slack mobile.
U07HXFWUD : android is probably worse!
U07HXFWUD : whats your idea with that slash commadn?
