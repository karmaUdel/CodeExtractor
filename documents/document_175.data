Any ideas on whether it is possible to add a new item to the ```+``` menu for the creating new types of files?
Not possible, special to google docs. Not open to the API
thanks for the info <@U1DM2B4SY>
Can I ask everyone: is this high/low? Would you share yours?
<@U06E352LU> - I have not but I did notice that the workflow is very different from using a service like <http://api.ai|api.ai>. @mattheiu I was hitting the API myself directly from the chat-bot. I do want to integrate some sort of middle ware though in the future. Just to see how well it would all work together.
<@U055FHACC> that looks very good
Also, I remember you shared a graph a users-per-team in an article
do you recall where it was?
<@U2DSW08UU> and <@U0HBN0L9M>, we have no integration with Botkit for now but it's a good idea :wink: We'll working on it! If you have any questions, feel free to ping <@U2UVDV3R6> or me :+1:
What would be the average retention for bots? Any benchmark published? Maybe someone from one of the analytics products here?
:thumbsup_all:
<@U055FHACC> not to my knowledge, but I think for Slack apps it should be compared to business web/mobile apps
I don't see why not
for MEssenger bot, it's a bit different, the threshold to test is so low that there are many "tourists"
Is that retention value based on usage? There is some good stats about retention from Slack on our recent blog post. <https://blog.howdy.ai/talkabot-talks-state-of-the-slack-platform-amir-shevat-slack-1eee5b056e07#.wm5zaps9y>
basically there is a long tail for staying on a team, but usage can be nil for these integrations.
bases on actual usage, sure. Not just on forgetting to uninstall..
_The question then is how many of those 8 integrations per team are actually used on a day-to-day basis?_
interesting question, is it answered by Amir?
is it in the talk rather than the article?
pretty though
very interesting
I'm starting to consider "users interacting with the bot per team" as one of the most relevant metric for slack apps
collecting anecdotal data for now
<@U0V93GE5R> I can only see "1/2 of apps abandonned in the first 7 days", so not totally unlike mobile apps
unanswered atm!
agree!
especially if you dont charge for the bot
but has to consider the team size somehow. Reaching full saturaion in a small team (eg 3 out of 3, 100% usage) is very different than the same in 1000-people team
Any advice on setting controller.hears priority in botkit when more than one can be matched? Many examples have different hears modules loaded from a folder but then it's unclear what goes first. Any better idea than prefixing the files with 00_onefile.js, 01_another.js.
Actually I should probably post in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit>. I'll do that.
<@U055FHACC> <@U0V93GE5R> <@U0HBN0L9M> yes, here at dashbot, we're very curious about “growth within a team” for a slackbot, something akin to “internal K factor”— I'll follow up with you on a private thread.
in my mind its “team morale"
when using your bot becomes a task versus a virtue
Since Slack is not too welcoming for guests/outsiders, team size usually caps your virality, so measuring internal growth would be very interesting. Is your bot reaching his full viral potential?
I have nothing to add beyond being very interested in the metrics topic
hello folks
anyone have some good examples of how to authenticate to an external service before being able to add a bot to the team?
<@U055FHACC> <@U0V93GE5R> <@U0HBN0L9M> <@U0DSTH2HL> sign up at <http://bCRM.com|bCRM.com> and get that insight - but better, use it for sending out campaign messages based on your users' timezone.
We have a very good retention report at Mixpanel, but I wanted to benchmark that vs other chat bots. I have no idea if we're going good or meh
Hi guys, nice to meet you all
<@U055FHACC> the campaign management for sending messages is separate in the same way that mailchimp doesn't measure 'intra-team growth'. But perhaps you can explain what you mean by that? Are you asking if there's a way to track the growth of a slack team using your bot?
<@U1DDKQPGB> you said “Sign up and get that insight” - what insight did you mean?
<@U055FHACC> where's that?

Hello everyone , Am Sivaram from India , a developer working for infinitewp. Am building several small apps on top of slack , here is my latest one <https://www.producthunt.com/posts/slackcatchup>

Hi guys, where do i put in technical questions?
Just want to know where do I get the oath token for a specific team from
<@U338CF0AC> , can this help out ?  <https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth>
<@U338CF0AC> as in creating a new OAuth token for a specific team or getting a token for a team that's already installed your app?
<@U272P5K71> Getting a token for a specific team, without getting authorization from the team again. Something like a oauth.list method isnt there, why is that?
Just got my first slack bot up and running, but I can't figure out how to get the username of the user that sent the message
<http://users.info|users.info> <@U34F4FH7U>
So <http://users.info|users.info> is going to return a hash of user info and then I need to look up the id that was provided in the message?
no, you would pass the ID as argument to <http://users.info|users.info>
and the hash returned would contain the name
Hi guys! Nice to meet you all. I'm Max, currently working for Seald and passionate about dev.
anyone notice today that slackbot is being slow to respond to keywords and also responding twice sometimes?
yeah just had a snarky Slackbot response post twice in response to a trigger, screwed up the joke a bit
It's a tool that enables you to encrypt messages &amp; files, on any communication platform on Chrome for the moment (slack, gmail, facebook, messenger…), with just one click. :point_up:
I was on the O'Reilly Bot Podcast, talking about Botkit, the life of being a bot developer, and what kind of things we need to see successful bot businesses:
<https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ben-brown-on-bot-tools>
listening now <@U04SM6T2H>.  good stuff!
:slightly_smiling_face: thanks
Good talk <@U04SM6T2H> !
Tweeting  it out!
Have a lovely weekend everyone :sunglasses::+1:
<@U04SM6T2H> great having you on the podcast - and thanks again for pulling this community together
<@U0554MQJB> any time!
<@U338CF0AC> as far as I know, we don't offer a way to list existing tokens, assuming the dev has access to the data store where they're storing the tokens on their end
<@U34F4FH7U> are you using RTM or Events API?
we've noticed that if the person who installed our bot is deleted from the team then the bot is basically uninstalled (which makes sense, I guess)
anyone have any suggestions for how to deal with this?

oops, sry for the encrypted message
Well, the encryption works.  :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U272P5K71> Ok, what scope do I need to make the bot post to <#C04SM6TAK|general>? When I try to post I get the error that I need to join the channel. How do I make the bot join the channel programmatically?
<@U338CF0AC> '/invite @botName'
<@U32L2MQ87> programmatically from the slack app's bot user
currently listening to this. Nice one. Getting to know about other stuffs like em Purple.
If you're using ES6, what are you using to watch for changes, or do you use a cli tool that transpiles as you run it?
I actually used es6 to write the bot for the firm I work with and didn't need some type of transpiler for anything as `Botkit` supports it
basic es6 syntax though
Yeah, node partially supports es6, but if you want to use, for example, ES6 imports you have to run through babel or somn'
oh, I didn't use es6 `imports`, so I may not know
guys, can i ask you a question about the botkit framework?
that's what this slack group is for <@U322K0W57> , so why not?
<@U322K0W57>  there's also a <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> channel :slightly_smiling_face:
yea... <#C0HNPFAF2|botkit-conversations> <@U322K0W57>
<@U338CF0AC> bot users can't join channels, they need to be invited - but you can use the user token to invite it if that user's in the channel
anyone giving away any invite codes for Botkit Studio? I would love to get to play with that.
haha <@U322K0W57> on that already?
seems you done with your FB bot
We are starting a private preview, if anyone wants to take a look feel free to dm <@U04S3JCH2> or myself
We will likely start letting in many more people after the Thanksgiving holiday.

I feel like I'm missing something ridiculous, I'm having real trouble identifying if a message from the events api is coming from my own bot, I can only seem to get a hold of the bots *userId* not the *botId* -- I thought that should be available when you get the `access_token` in the first place, no?
<@U0KECURAT> i forget the specifics, but note that your bot's message event will appear differently — with different fields — depending on the value of `as_user` when you send the message
it might be that when you do `as_user: false` it has `subtype: bot_message`, but not if you do `as_user: true`, something like that
doesn't solve your problem, but maybe relevant
this is the most complicated thing <@U0KECURAT>
I discussed this recently with <@U0D7LHNTX> and <@U2QGELSTS>
without the benefit of rtm.start, it becomes a PITA when they don't have all the fields in the API response
I have encountered this too…I need to look up in my code how I dealt with iit :wink:
<@U0D7LHNTX> please do! 
Has anyone here ever deploys a botkit chatbot to Azure?
<@U2DSW08UU> this might help you: <http://www.stevenfollis.com/2015/04/04/setting-up-a-slack-bot-on-azure-web-apps/>
Sweet thanks man!
no worries buddy
<@U0KECURAT> it's complicated :) this might help add some clarity :grimacing: :point_down: 
I want to cry and at the same time to hug <@U0D1YNBEE>
<@U0D1YNBEE> thanks for that, shame it's nearly impossible to get that info :confused:
Hello everyone, I just began developing bots on slack, could anyone tell me what is the best way to show the "user / bot is typing..." message near chat input when my bot is writing a message?
<@U35DKDK8Q> send an rtm message with `{ type: 'typing': channel: '{channelId}' }` -- ~you might need an `id` in there but I don't think so~ (you don't)
<@U0KECURAT> thanks will try it out later after work :slightly_smiling_face:
someone just landed on this team -&gt; :partyparrot:

Hello all, i pushed a really cool library on Github to have a welcome bot on our slack communities :wink:
<@U36NU4BBQ> cool, a link to it would be cool or maybe some more info :slightly_smiling_face:
<https://github.com/slugbay/slack-welcome-bot> deployable in 5mn on Heroku :wink:
anybody has any multiple conversation threads examples?
Could anyone advise a worthy bot analytics tool?
I'll suggest <http://dashbot.io|dashbot.io>, I'm one of the makers. :) 
Hehe well that's kind of biased although I heard about you guys, is there a demo?
:grinning:
Yup! I'm biased, :grinning:. We have a tour at <https://www.dashbot.io/tour> or, I'm happy to hop on a hangout today and give you a live demo, we can chat in DM.. that said, we just passed over processing 200 million messages today, :tada:
Question: If want to deploy node bot to a server. Is it good practice to compile an output for deployment?
compile an output?
Hello all, could anyone help with using botkit to show the "user_name is typing..." text in dark grey near slack chat input?
<@U35DKDK8Q> you can use bot.startTyping to indicate that the bot is typing, if this is what you are looking for
<@U35DKDK8Q> has the same arguments as bot.replyAndUpdate() for example (check documentation to see more: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/readme-slack.md#botreplyandupdate>)
<https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/507>
Hi, I've a question. I'm trying to setup the event api bot. need verify my url on localhost. The url validator just cannot use my ip address. Is there a bypass for this?
<@U36JH8YTW> some have a lot of success using tools like ngrok to tunnel traffic during development -- whether working with Events API or slash commands or message buttons; here's a tutorial on that: <https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok>
great, thanks
can someone please help me with some examples with convo.gotoThread() and/or convo.addQuestion()
Hey everyone, I would like to know how your collecting feedback from your users once the bot is done, by message / outside link to a website, what are the options and what would you recommend and why :slightly_smiling_face:
Hi all! So I've been playing around with a few bot frameworks out there and really keen to get started with botkit... just one thing I couldn't figure out yet.... Is there any *way to integrate a botkit bot on a website/webapp*? We're building a bit to help our business clients. Any while some already use Slack, a lot won't have Slack or even Facebook Messenger and will need an alternative way to access the bot.... I had a look at Smooch and while that looks great, especially since it's built on botkit, I got very confused because it seems to use Slack only for customer service and not for the end user? Some HTML5 chat client would be amazing... any hints on how to get started with that?
Hello. I have bundled my bot into a slack app. How do install the slack app without submitted to the app directory. I want to do this for development before I submit a fully working app for review.
<@U36NAH5HD> It's the same whether the app is submitted or not to the app directory: you need to use the Add to Slack and the OAuth workflow
<https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button>
<@U0GT29N3A> thank you.
<@U36SE08DA>: I just tweeted at ya about this :)
can I use firebase as an action URL for interactive messages?
I would prefer the payload to stored in firebase and have my server look it up.
How do I use chat.update instead of chat.postMessage
?
I am using interactive messages, and I would like update the existing message with new message.
<@U36NAH5HD> Can you show some code so we can see what you are trying to do?
Thank you so much for building this community.
My first question is is there a page or a complete `readme` file where I can refer all the functions for `botkit`? As of now, i can only find common references via <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/tree/master>
<@U37C5V3HT>: I don't believe there is one. Though seems like a worthy project. :)
Yep! I love it <@U2XP0JPPS>
I need some help if you're aware of making such slack bot, and I wonder :simple_smile:
I just posted an issue on github regarding `botkit` that is <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/513>
need some help with a basic one that is how to keep a 4-5 greeting messages and then a bot can reply on random baisis.
That doesn't seem like a function botkit should supply. But I'm happy to work with you on that
this following code from botkit only..
