U044HMK7S : I really need to write a newsletter. It's up to 450 subscribers and I haven't sent anything in a while.
U044G404Z : <@U044JU5CA>: <https://github.com/pheuter/essential-react/tree/master/src/routers>
U044G404Z : a react starter kit, very minimal and they use react-router with es6 classes
U044JU5CA : Nice. My main problem with it is that I think putting the router object on `this.context` feels strange and awkward
U044JU5CA : and you need to define `Foo.contextTypes` everywhere as well
U044HMK7S : <@U044JU5CA>: I use a flux implementation that passes a flux object through the context and I'm actually really liking it
U044JU5CA : do you need to use contextTypes with that?
U044HMK7S : yeah, for anything with context you do, that's the only annoying part
U044JU5CA : and in ES6 classes it seems you can only write them after you've defined your class
U044JU5CA : ```
U044JU5CA : ```class Foo extends React.Component {
  render () {
   &lt;span&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;
  }
}

Foo.contextTypes = {
  router: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired
}
```

U044HMK7S : create a text snippet
U044G404Z : yeah context is still not final in react.js. i dont like context but who cares what i like :wink:
U044JU5CA : it'd be fine if I didn't have to write contextTypes like that
U044JU5CA : messes up the cleanness of writing `export default class Foo extends React.Component {`
U044HMK7S : I've used context for a year now :wink: and i prefer react.createclass still because of a couple of these problems...
U044JU5CA : this.context.hipster
U044JU5CA : :stuck_out_tongue:
U044JU5CA : yeah I guess maybe I should stick to createClass for now
U044HMK7S : hehe my friend actually found it before any documentation came out, hes crazy
U044JU5CA : jumping the gun a bit
U044G404Z : but you can write it old style using ```export default const Foo = React.Class({ contextTypes: {something: React...}});```
U044G404Z : its midnight here... time to find my bed. see ya all
U044HMK7S : <@U044G404Z>: night
U044K7KEW : ohai
U044HMK7S : <@U044K7KEW>: yo
U044K7KEW : are you guys also on IRC ? sounds redundant
U044K8P28 : hello
U044HMK7S : <@U044K7KEW>: I am hardly ever, I already have slack open all day too
U044K7KEW : yeah I see the point, idk, kinda bothers me to have "2 slacks" opened :wink:
U044HMK7S : <@U044K7KEW>: i have 3 :wink:
