I don't think `let`  `in` is lazy
I like how all of this discussion is necessary simply because a function with sideeffects exists.
is there an online tool where you can see the compiled JS elm creates?
something like <https://lebab.io/try-it>
<@U37HUSJ4R> Not that I know of, but I will usually compile with elm-make and then look at the JS output in my text editor when I need to do that.
There was something that luke hadmade a while ago to do just that.
<@U37HUSJ4R> There is this documentation that I started writing to cover some of the info required: <https://github.com/eeue56/elm-ffi/tree/master/docs#elm-compiled-documentation>
what was that library for checking an old model against the new model and discarding anything that doesn't match?
oh, is it elm-validate?
Is it possible to combine union types and extensible records?
