U5X85H02X : how can i put this type of date format in a mysql query?
U5X85H02X : 2017-06-14 00:00:00
U5X85H02X : date and time
U1BP42MRS : What have you tried?
U5X85H02X : datetime.date(2017-06-14 00:00:00)
U5X85H02X : import datetime
U1BP42MRS : Please format code with backticks around it
U5X85H02X : what do you mean
U0LSCQQNR : <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks>
U1BP42MRS : ````code`
```

U1X2RAWSK : That was unnecessarily hard :stuck_out_tongue:
U1BP42MRS : That's also invalid python you posted - so already it suggests that you aren't really showing what you have tried :confused:
U0LSCQQNR : makes it easier to format code for readability compared to regular text
U0LSCQQNR : so, `datetime.date` requires three inputs
U0LSCQQNR : `year`, `month`, `day`
U0LSCQQNR : all have to be integers
U0LSCQQNR : eg, `datetime.date(2017, 05, 17)`
U5X85H02X : the thing is that i get this format from jquery date time picker
U1BP42MRS : <@U5X85H02X> <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime>
U5X85H02X : is there any way i can manage the format i posted because all my data is saved like that and  i have to do the queries in that format to get the correct detail
U5X85H02X : from the database
U5X85H02X : my queries have to with date and time values because in the database are saved in this format
U1BP42MRS : You mean they are not saved as datetimes?
U2BS4M1RV : Anyone here used dreamfactory? Trying to insert a list of rows using a stored procedure. Hoping not to have to do thousands of calls to the sp.
U5X85H02X : date and time
U5X85H02X : 2017-06-14 00:00:00
U5X85H02X : 2017-06-14 23:59:59
U1BP42MRS : As what column type?
U1BP42MRS : How are you querying?
U1BP42MRS : Please give more relevant info, you can see <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask> for tips on how to ask good questions
U5X85H02X : i think you are been an ass
U5X85H02X : if you dont know
U5X85H02X : dont say anything
U5X85H02X : <@U1BP42MRS>
U1BP42MRS : You realize I am asking more questions to better understand your question to actually solve it right?
U1BP42MRS : Calling people names is not something we tolerate here.
U5NMSURAQ : :smile:
U0NRYQNAZ : yea, stop being a poo poo head.
U1BP42MRS : #Banned
U5VGKQ2SY : Was about to drop some spanglish to let her know what was up... but yeah, account deactivated
U0EPQL3LG : <@U0NRYQNAZ> poo poo head... them's is fightin' words ...
U0NRYQNAZ : <@U5X85H02X> there are ways to format datetimes. depending on what you are using to query the database some of this can be done for you. we don't really know if questions aren't posted with example code that replicates what you are trying to do or code that shows what you have tried.
U0NRYQNAZ : hence, the reason you are being directed to a SO guide.
U2BS4M1RV : I think that person is go bye bye.
U1NSCAY6R : why isn't “poo poo head” in the list of profanity for <@USLACKBOT> ?
U5VCG8JHE : Do you find the language to be obscene?
U5VCG8JHE : Or silly?
U2BS4M1RV : Hate to repeat myself, but I think it may have been missed in that fun.
U2BS4M1RV : Anyone here used dreamfactory? Trying to insert a list of rows using a stored procedure. Hoping not to have to do thousands of calls to the sp.
U0NRYQNAZ : no, never heard of dreamfactory.
U5VGKQ2SY : lol <@U2BS4M1RV>
U0NRYQNAZ : sounds pleasant.
U0NRYQNAZ : you can fire off stored procedures with sqlalchemy.
U1NSCAY6R : sounds like a dream ~
U0NRYQNAZ : that's about all i know.
U5VGKQ2SY : I  thought about it <@U1NSCAY6R>, but didn't want to go there.... lol
U2BS4M1RV : dreamfactory is a php application that provides a rest api for many databases. It's really nice in ways, can be frustrating.
U0NRYQNAZ : sounds like the opposite of a dream.
U0NRYQNAZ : php
U0NRYQNAZ : comatose
U2BS4M1RV : Well, learning how to do deal with it is fun, and the documentation is lacking and somewhat outdated.
U0NRYQNAZ : mummification
U1BP42MRS : That's a dangerous proposition. I don't care about the language, the issue is leaking a database and relations to an API. It's good to try to have some separation of the view layer and the persistence layer
U2BS4M1RV : It is nice not having to deal with mysql library deficiencies and install issues. Also makes it easier to protect a database.
U2BS4M1RV : We're using stored procedure calls through the rest api, so very little is exposed to the user, and it's per key for access.
U0NRYQNAZ : i'm mostly just joking around. sorry i can't be more help.
U2BS4M1RV : Just hoping I don't have to call my stored procedure once per row to insert... it's going to be hundreds of thousands of rows.
U5VGKQ2SY : Are you locked into DreamFactory?
U1BP42MRS : That is good to hear, though sprocs scare me for other reasons :joy: . Bad flashbacks
U2BS4M1RV : No. We've been using it for a few months though.
U5VGKQ2SY : Had never heard of it before, looking through their site, looks solid. Last couple of API's I did were w/ Slim (PHP framework). Sorry, can't help.
U2BS4M1RV : If we keep breaking the mysql cluster maybe we'll switch to postgres and something else. :slightly_smiling_face:
U0LSCQQNR : crunchy mysql
U486CN4VD : Does anyone have experience making large requests to facebook endpoints?
U2BS4M1RV : What's that?
U0LSCQQNR : <@U2BS4M1RV> just me being facetious
U2BS4M1RV : oh, okay.
U0LSCQQNR : <@U486CN4VD> not here, sorry
U42LCHFD2 : <@U486CN4VD> yes - what kinds of requests
U486CN4VD : endpoints related to advertising campaigns! /campaigns, /adsets, /ads
U42LCHFD2 : Ah I dealt more so with querying and pulling info on pages
U42LCHFD2 : but what kind of stuff are you wondering about?
U486CN4VD : efficient ways to grab several thousand records/json arrays
U42LCHFD2 : u can use python with just requests and json thats what I always use
U42LCHFD2 : actually just with requests even
U42LCHFD2 : `requests.get('url').json()`  you just want to look at their documentation and dig a little to find out how you can make the most requests possible - because some of their apis do allow batching, or multiple queries at one time
U5PJK7JHE : hey what is the best way to write a list of json objects to a file
U5PJK7JHE : I was thinking of writing it into a csv
U5PJK7JHE : where each row is a basically a json object or should I save it as a json file?
U1BP42MRS : <@U5PJK7JHE> You should probably either do a CSV, which would mean breaking the JSON into columns in your CSV or just a file where each line is a new JSON object
U1BP42MRS : You could make the JSON a column of the CSV, technically, but that would be kind of awkward to use again
U5PJK7JHE : yeah that is very awkward and hard to use I am thinking of latter
U1BP42MRS : Are you going to want to search them for anything? If so - you may be best served to dump the contents into a database so you can query and such
U5PJK7JHE : yeah right now I just want to work with files and if needed we can move to db
U42LCHFD2 : how big is the file
U5PJK7JHE : its quite small 1200x250x4 float array is basically what it is
U42LCHFD2 : dump it as json then either transfor in refine in a matter of seconds or drop it on here if its small enough: <https://konklone.io/json/>
U5PJK7JHE : oh it is better if I automate it I just dumped as a json object
U5PJK7JHE : thanks  guys!
U5PJK7JHE : hey guys I have a quick question ```
dict = {....}
keys = dict.keys()
values = dict.values()
dict2 = dict(zip(keys,values)
```
will dict and dict2 be the same always?

U29TTK2NS : since dictionaries are unordered, I would suspect the output of zip to produce the same results as the original dict, barring mutation of keys or values
U29TTK2NS : this is my best guess
U29TTK2NS : contents and keys i'm confident in
U29TTK2NS : ordering, not sure but think they probably will be the same
U29TTK2NS : I assume that shallow copy or deep copy is not related to your problem
U29TTK2NS : if uncertain, instead of `dict == dict2` you could ask `all(dict.keys() in dict2)`
U1NSCAY6R : Since dictionaries don't keep order like <@U29TTK2NS> said, the calls to `keys` and `values` are not guaranteed to be in the same order (though the resulting lists _do_ maintain their order but are not created in order). Because of that, zipping them back together will not be equal (because keys may have new values and order may not be the same). However if you used an `OrderedDict` then keys and values lists will maintain order, so calling `zip` in that instance would result in the same results 
U5XHLGL4B : hi, i'm getting TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable when using data = request.json(). any ideas why? thanks in advance!
U486CN4VD : hi <@U5XHLGL4B>, what is `request`?
