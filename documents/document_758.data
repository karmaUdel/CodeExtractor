U4872964V : it’s because you are updating a field in a record, yes
U4872964V : so you have three layers, the `WebData` layer, the record layer, and the `List` layer
U37HUSJ4R : is there a way to simplfy it? seems so complex
U4872964V : well, your Foo only has one field so why do you have a record? If you have multiple fields in it then that’s the complexity your data has
U37HUSJ4R : yeh Foo was just an example
U37HUSJ4R : I have mutliple fields
U4872964V : but the way to make it less complex is to do what I suggested, make a function for each layer, so the functions themselves are simple, then just combine them
U4872964V : basically the essence of functional programming :slightly_smiling_face:
U37HUSJ4R : do you have a code example of this? be great to see some code even if it was a simple example
U4872964V : yes, so you have updateCustomDates already
U4872964V : then```
updateFoo : Int -&gt; Foo -&gt; Foo
updateFoo index foo = { foo | bar = updateCustomDates index foo.bar }
```

U37HUSJ4R : ok then `updateFoo` can be used inside my `update`
U4872964V : then```
RemoteData.map (updateFoo index) foo
```

U37HUSJ4R : ah right ok
U4872964V : etc
U4872964V : and so what <@U3SJEDR96> was suggesting was basically the same but using anonymous functions (lambdas)
U37HUSJ4R : :slightly_smiling_face:
U37HUSJ4R : thanks will look into it
U37HUSJ4R : very helpful
U4872964V : you’re welcome!
U153UK3FA : <@U37HUSJ4R> the nice thing about `map` is that it allows you to not need to care about the containing type, if you later decide that ‘WebData Foo’ isn’t what you want and instead you just need a ‘Maybe Foo`, all the code for handling `Foo` is unchanged and you can pass the same functions to `Maybe.map` instead
U170TNSTZ : Any good discussions on Elm vs Reason on the web? Google is failing me, since there are a lot of “reasons for using Elm” :wink:
