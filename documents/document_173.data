U04SM6T2H : booya :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : I'm really trying to host an open and productive community here!
U04SM6T2H : Hopefully we can all share in the learning!
U069GF9UY : Sounds good to me
U04SM6T2H : hi ADAM!

U04SX1L23 : Has anyone run into this bug? Normally when you upload a file to a user via direct message—the "Share with" dropdown refers to that user... but in my case when people upload a file to my bot user.. the drop down has the name of a public channel instead.
U04SX1L23 : For example.. here I'm uploading a file to my bot user called `tasks-bot` but the dropdown is showing `#announcements`.
U04SM6T2H : I dreamed that I built a bot that could change the art on my walls
U069GF9UY : So, next step is surrounding yourself with digital displays running a network connected device...
U069GF9UY : ```/artwork refresh```
U04SM6T2H : exactly :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : or projectors on every wall :simple_smile:
U069GF9UY : ```Hey @Curator, give me something new to look at```
U04SM6T2H : now you're talking
U04SM6T2H : “How about this selection, sir?"
U04SM6T2H : heh
U04SM6K6N : I dreamed that I was using spellcheck markings in Slack as a code to help the Cluster in Sense8 communicate with each other when the bad guy was eavesdropping on their psychic chats.
U069GF9UY : Guys, I think we may think about Slack too much.
U04SM6T2H : I just received this message as a neural impulse
U04SM6T2H : so yes
