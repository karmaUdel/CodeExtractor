U4TPM36MU : I was 
U4TPM36MU : <@U3U7G58P6> I want to start using it again
U3U7G58P6 : so u use 1 before?
U4TPM36MU : Express isn't as bad as it used to be before they modularized everything 
U4TPM36MU : Yeah
U3U7G58P6 : koa2 is just bare a server
U3U7G58P6 : without anything, so modularized =[

how to make botkit hears the title of the postback object not the payload ?
like this for this example :
```
controller.hears('Bookmark Item', 'facebook_postback', ...){....}
```

U4XP037GC : Would you use this? An app that organizes the latest technology videos into specific trending topics and sends you the ones that are most interesting to you.<https://www.producthunt.com/posts/kllect-tech-videos-curated-for-you>

U0GT29N3A : :slack: Interactives messages stage 2: *drop down menus* are now available : <https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/build-an-interactive-slack-app-with-message-menus-1fb2c6298308>Congrats and thank you for this nice feature :+1:

U0L5BM5DE : Hi everybody—<http://Memo.AI|Memo.AI> was part of the early release for Slack's new Message Menus feature. We've written about how it's now much easier to use our Slack app and shared some technical details behind the implementation: <https://blog.memo.ai/10x-your-slack-apps-ux-with-message-menus-98a5a09b3a7a>

U0L5BM5DE : We're also on <http://ProductHunt.com|ProductHunt.com> today, we'd love to get your feedback on Memo! (and maybe an up-vote :grin:)
U4RLKTQ3W : Is distributing the app and submitting to directory, the same thing?
U272P5K71 : <@U4RLKTQ3W> no - distributing means you're going to implement the OAuth flow rather than the single team app token generation
U272P5K71 : App directory submission is in the same panel, but not required
U4X9AA8U9 : I'm a total novice when it comes to slack apps but I do have prior programming experience
Does anyone have advice for where I should start? What editor I should use, if any?

U4RLKTQ3W : <@U272P5K71> Thanks. Does that mean I can activate the distribution but it wont be publicly available, right?
U272P5K71 : yep
U3QHKHJNQ : I'm blanking on the name of a Slack app that lets you overlord a Bot that is say, talking to customers (from within Slack), hand select responses from a tree and even butt-in and take over if you want. Anyone know the one I'm talking about? It's on the tip of my brain-tongue.
U0554MQJB : <@U3QHKHJNQ> I think you mean <http://dashbot.io|dashbot.io> <@U0DSTH2HL>
U0554MQJB : <https://www.dashbot.io/tour#liveperson>
U0DSTH2HL : Yup! That's us, lmk if you have any questions! 
U3QHKHJNQ : hmm.. that seems close, but I recall seeing the option to see what the bot was "thinking" in terms of potential answers/bot decision tree
U3QHKHJNQ : maybe I'm confusing two different apps though
U4YN2Q6FQ : I'm currently working on an app that incorporates a bot that can listen to requests made to it (whether by IM or tagging in private conversations/channels/etc). Up until now, I've had it working only within a single team, and no major issues - until I realised after trying to install it to a second team that the OAuth code I'd been using was tied specifically to a team (calling the /users.list endpoint listed only users from one team).
I'd like to be able to listen to any number of teams and reply to them accordingly as in the first - but can't seem to retrieve any channel data beyond the one I installed to first. I have a moderate number of OAuth scopes enabled on the app, as well as the Events API (mostly team events). Interestingly, though I don't get events in the second team I installed it to like the first, adding bot events (for channels the bot is in) allows me to see messages in channels the bot is in in the second team.

The approach I'm using to reply to messages relevant to the bot at the moment is to store the id of the bot user, and the IM it owns - if the user is tagged whereby its ID appears in the message (like `&lt;@WU234KJH&gt;`) or a message is sent in the IM directly to it, then it responds to the appropriate IM/channel/etc. as required.

Am I missing something or taking the wrong approach in building a bot that can listen to and respond to multiple teams? Thanks in advance.

U3XEF6WBZ : Hi folks. I'm subbmitting my app to the app-directory but I can't figure out what this question is about
U3XEF6WBZ : Ho I have to provide a slack team domain and a USER CREDENTIALS (?!?) with the app already installed? it sounds very wired ( and not very secure)
U0GT29N3A : <@U3XEF6WBZ> "for a *new* Slack team". You can just create a special team dedicated for the App Directory submission.
U0GT29N3A : Obviously don't give them credentials for your own team(s) :wink:
U3XEF6WBZ : thanks <@U0GT29N3A> still it sounds wired
U4W32J5GX : Hi guys, quick question on botkit - perhaps any of you have solved this. I'm trying to find a way to be configure custom path in the Slack app so that instead of /oauth and /login I can use /my/custom/path/oauth and /my/custom/path/login. But I can't find the options to do this in botkit. Hope there is a stupidly obvious way I'm not considering :slightly_smiling_face:
U45ENH8AD : west: Have you seen the tutorials on Github?
U45ENH8AD : I use the Python client and the tutorials are great to get started.
U45ENH8AD : <https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Python-Onboarding-Tutorial>
U4RLKTQ3W : I have my slack app running on ec2. It worked fine for a long time now but suddenly it stopped and when I looked into logs it said something like :```
raise Exception.SSLError - hostname <http://slack.com|slack.com> doesn't match either 'som_hostname'.com and blah
```

U4RLKTQ3W : I enabled the app distribution yesterday. Does it have something to do with this as the app was created using different team and now serving different team?
U272P5K71 : what URLs do you have for the OAuth redirect URLs?
U4RLKTQ3W : I used `localhost:port/endpoint` as it was a one time thing right. By that I mean I just wanted to do the app authorization once
U20R7SEKA : Anyone know if there's a max number of menu items that can be used?
U20R7SEKA : Or if it can be used to respond to what's typed in the menu box? I want to use it to display search results of a sort 
U07CW6N3A : A static collection or one provided in a single external suggestions/options load URL can have up 100 options!
U07CW6N3A : But with the typeahead feature, we'll send you an options load request once a certain number of characters have been typed, that will include the query as a `value`, which you can then use in conjunction with the engaging user, channel, etc. to build a list of 100 options in response to the query. So you can accomplish a search box of sorts that way
U20R7SEKA : Nice! I've got a db of 27,000 records that I'd like to be able to search through using the box so that sounds like it'd work well
U20R7SEKA : Do menus allow for a little icon sized image in them? Or just text? <@U07CW6N3A>
