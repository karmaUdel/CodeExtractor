U601ELFEG : And.. looking for others working on music and Elm - MIDI, browser MIDI support, etc....
U0CLDU8UB : I have implemented `maybeToList` several times myself :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : What's the type signature? Not sure I'm following
U0K92QFST : mzero: <@U0JFXEUCT> :point_up:
U0K92QFST : also <@U0F5SH6UQ>
U1CE9DL9H : `Maybe a -&gt; List a`, creates a singleton list for just, empty list otherwise
U1CE9DL9H : also the first example of a natural transformation in a programming context
U5FU80S06 : Is there by any chance a browser debugger tool where I can see the state of the _model_ at any time?
U0K92QFST : <@U5FU80S06> you bet there is!
U0K92QFST : if you start your app with `elm-reactor` you'll see it
U0CLDU8UB : Yep. I like to use it for conditional views:```
div [] (maybeToList maybeThis ++ maybeToList maybeThat)
```

U5FU80S06 : I have been using `elm-make Main.elm --output elm.js` and then simply opening _index.html_. How would I use `elm-reactor`?
U3SJEDR96 : Right, gotcha, makes sense :slightly_smiling_face: I wonder if it's worth having in an -extra package somewhere, even if it's just `Maybe.map List.singleton |&gt; withDefault []`
U0J1M0F32 : <@U5FU80S06> `elm-reactor Main.elm`
U0K92QFST : simply start `elm-reactor` (it should come with the runtime) and go to localhost:8000
U0J1M0F32 : ^
U0K92QFST : If it shows you your file tree, just click on `Main.elm`. It will run your app with a live debugger.
U1CE9DL9H : <@U3SJEDR96> it already exists <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/maybe-extra/4.0.0/Maybe-Extra#toList>
U3SJEDR96 : :smile: Ah. Figures :slightly_smiling_face:
U2CUK7KQA : <@U5FU80S06> IIRC you can also use `elm-make --debug`
U0K92QFST : :point_up: i didn't know about that!
U5FU80S06 : <@U0K92QFST> I get ```Oops! Something went wrong when starting your Elm program.
Trying to initialize the `Main` module with an unexpected flag.
I tried to convert it to an Elm value, but ran into this problem:

Expecting an Int but instead got: undefined``` Note that I'm using `main = Html.programWithFlags...` and passing in an `Int` from JS.

U0K92QFST : Unfortunately: <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor/issues/199>
U0K92QFST : but you can try the `elm make --debug Main.elm `
U3SJEDR96 : Eh, don't let that stop you, <@U0CLDU8UB> to the rescue
U0CLDU8UB : But if you use an index.html like this <https://github.com/ohanhi/elm-taco/blob/master/index.html> , you can point the browser to the index.html while `elm-reactor` is running and it'll work!
U3SJEDR96 : (told ya)
U0K92QFST : lol
U0CLDU8UB : literally lol
U17J54S2U : lohabuyshan: What does your `Flags` type look like?
U17J54S2U : And what are you passing at init
