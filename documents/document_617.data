```
at that point, each field is a valid instance of a possibly valid value
So you'd like to do something like `Field.map2 Model field1 field2` ?
yes, sort of, i believe
field1 and field2 would probably be extraction functions?
or Decoders, so to speak
so extracting each field already gives you a `Result` right?
at the moment, yes. you got me thinking that a `Maybe` is enough.
Both `Result` and `Maybe` define a `map2` function
basically, the decoding needs to only work if every field is `Valid ...`
woa
that may be what i'm looking for...
I think you could do something like `Maybe.map2 Model (fetchUsername form) (fetchPassword form)`
yes. probably better to use (fetch .username)
