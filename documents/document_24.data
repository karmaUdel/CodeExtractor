```
as you see, it can alias a Long array
I see, any thoughts on my original question? :wink:
if the collection might in some cases already be a vector, or it's an array that won't be aliased, use vec
if you already have a vector and need to add to it, or if you need to do some transformation like mapping or filtering as you add things, use into
if none of those conditions apply, it doesn't matter which you use
when I mention transforms here, I'm talking about using the transducing arg to into btw
Wonderful, thank you very much for this piece of advice.
