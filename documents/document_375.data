U2SR9DL7Q : i'm designing for the small screen first through then moving my way outwards.
U17PWHU4D : been struggling since yesterday on importing an array from json with mixed types.  Its always consistent.  `[ int, int, string, int ]`.
U17PWHU4D : Im' using pipeline decoder.  and works for everything else, however, I have to specify a type alias. and have no idea how to describe this.
U17PWHU4D : any advice would be much appreciated.
U5J0H2NS2 : Did you try oneOf ?
U17PWHU4D : was trying to learn oneOf, but i think the issues is more that i need to map.  i got this far, with the help of someone yesterday.
U17PWHU4D : ```segmentsDecoder list =
    Decode.map5 &lt;need type alias here&gt;
        (Decode.index 0 <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
        (Decode.index 1 <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
        (Decode.index 2 Decode.string)
        (Decode.index 3 <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
        (Decode.index 4 <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)


segmentDecoder : Decoder SegmentResponse
segmentDecoder =
    decode SegmentResponse
        |&gt; required "segments" (Decode.list segmentsDecoder)
```

U17PWHU4D : it feels like oneOf is more for if i wanted to convert if all index are not the same type.  When really, i just want to pull that `index 2` out and make it a key/dict or something.
U2D7NUGS1 : :champagne: Just published my first Elm package! <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/lzrski/elm-polymer/latest>
U2D7NUGS1 : Thanks for your tremendous help!
U0CLDU8UB : <@U17PWHU4D> Does your JSON look something like this:```
{ "segments": [ 4, 2, "yes", 4, 2 ] }
```

U17PWHU4D : yes, exactly <@U0CLDU8UB> !
U0CLDU8UB : Okay so what is the problem you are facing?
U17PWHU4D : so this is my first attempt with json decoders.  and i'm able to correctly decode all other data.
U17PWHU4D : but as far as i know i need to specify an alias, so the decoder, can use it to create the Elm object.
U17PWHU4D : in my ex. above.  after Decode.map5.
U0CLDU8UB : You can do that, or use a function. For example, if you wanted to make that into a 5-element tuple, you could:```
 segmentsDecoder list =
    Decode.map5 (\num1 num2 str num3 num4 -&gt; ( num1, num2, str, num3, num4 ))
        (Decode.index 0 <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
        ...
```

U0CLDU8UB : But what does your `SegmentResponse` type look like?
U17PWHU4D : i removed a lot of the other fields, but it just includes 1 field that has the segments key, with the mixed array.
U17PWHU4D : what you showed me is great here though.  so basically, those args of the Tuple, match up to the decode.index below, correct?
U0CLDU8UB : Correct
U17PWHU4D : ah, great, going to give this a shot, i'll ping if i get stuck again.  thank you a ton!
U0CLDU8UB : the very bottom of this page explains the same thing gradually: <http://ohanhi.com/secret-spy-messages.html>
U17PWHU4D : oh nice, going to read that right now…
U17PWHU4D : it worked perfect <@U0CLDU8UB> .   Can't thank you enough for that one!
U37BS6J6N : ello all, trying to do the extra credit for the "random" exercise in the docs and I can't seem to get my update to return the correct type
