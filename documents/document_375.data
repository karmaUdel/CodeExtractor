```
startgame returns a div with a button in it, render Game returns the game board
I was about to ask another question, but I _think_ I just answered it for myself.
I was going to ask what if I did just want a small piece of a page to show up or not. But I realized that a helper function just makes that this scenario again.
And putting a case in a list is exactly the situation where I'd want to abstract with a helper
you always need to choose between one or more things
you don't get the option of a case/if returning nothing
what they return could be an empty `div` or a `text ""`, but it has to be something
spoiled for choice
