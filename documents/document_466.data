U64M3DF1B : <#C12KMAYJX|elm-mdl> I'm on elm 0.18 and using debois/elm-mdl - and this piece will not agree with me at all :cry: 
```
menuItemView : AppState -&gt; String -&gt; Html Msg
menuItemView appstate name =
    <http://List.li|List.li>
        []
        [
            List.content
                [
                    Options.css "cursor" "pointer"
                ,   Options.attribute &lt;| Options.onClick (ShowMenuItemPane name)
                ]
                [
                    text name
                ]
        ]

```

I have the imports, the `type Msg = ... | ShowMenuItemPane` - but she tells me: 

```
The right side of (&lt;|) is causing a type mismatch.

167|                     Options.attribute &lt;| (Options.onClick (ShowMenuItem name)
                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(&lt;|) is expecting the right side to be a:

    Attribute m

But the right side is:

    Options.Property c Msg
```

U23SA861Y : do you even need the `Options.attribute &lt;|`
U64M3DF1B : ? perhaps no! I'll tell you in 2sec :slightly_smiling_face:
U2SR9DL7Q : depending on the mdl element, I've had to use Options.attribute... since mdl expect a `Style a` type
U64M3DF1B : :partyparrot3: you're amazing! thx!
U64M3DF1B : for reference - this is what works (thx to <@U23SA861Y>)```
            List.content
                [
                    Options.css "cursor" "pointer"
                ,   Options.onClick (ShowMenuItem name)
                ]
                [
                    text name
                ]

```

U64M3DF1B : that - at least - is NOT obvious if you scout the package documentation :slightly_smiling_face:
(well - perhaps it is obvious and I'm just not totally converted to reading the Elm way of typing and spec'ing the syntax)

U5ABF3BH7 : Hello! Does anyone have a very basic example in Elm of an app with new page, edit page, index page, etc.. (ruby on Rails platform with controllers, etc..). I am getting a bit lost in the complexity of the examples I see.
U5ABF3BH7 : I have all the data from the backend, that I decode into my Model.  I want to use the view of my FirstCallNew, I don't know how to enter that in
U5ABF3BH7 : ```main =    Html.programWithFlags
        { init = init
        , view = FirstCallNew.view
        , update = FirstCallNew.update
        , subscriptions = FirstCallNew.subscriptions
        }```

U5ABF3BH7 : Can I do something like  ```view = FirstCallNew.view Model.initwithParams(case_id)``` or something like that. The case_id being the params that help me retrieve my data
U5ABF3BH7 : ?
U23SA861Y : so, the way you handle the initial render is you appropriately set init you init state such that view renders correctly with that data
U5ABF3BH7 : Let's say I have my record with all the fields with the values from extracting them with decoding. Is there a simpler way then having to write
U5ABF3BH7 : all the values. I must be stuck on something stupid.
U23SA861Y : I don't follow you, you need to be explict about how your data maps to your view
U5ABF3BH7 : can I write something like init = FirstCallNew.view.init model (where model is what I got from decoding)?
U5ABF3BH7 : <@U23SA861Y> let me try again
U23SA861Y : no, your code hasn't even run by that point so how have you decoded anything
U23SA861Y : init isn't the intial view, it's the initial model and the initial command
U23SA861Y : also why are all your TEA functions in a module called `FirstCallNew`?
U5ABF3BH7 : <@U23SA861Y>. I already have a module FirstCallNew,  we started with the new page (how to create a new case). Now I want to create the edit page for a case, which is pretty similar to the new page but with info pulled from the database.
U5ABF3BH7 : I have a FirstCallNew view with init, main, update, subscriptions.I want to reuse that module, but now my Model, is not initiated for new data, but using the data a pulled from the decoder. 
If I have for example type Model =
           {firstName : String, 
           , location : Location.Model, 
           , address1 : string
           …
           }

From decoding via an api, I know how build my model with id 235. I haven't decoded yet, I am not sure how to start it
so I have model235 = { firstName = "Alfred", location ={ organizationName = "BellaOrg", type_ = "Resident Facility}, address1 = "204 Grant"}
I want it so that when the user goes to the url  ```frontend/cases/edit/235```
Then my FirstCallView is filled with the data I got, so my init model is supposed to be model235

Should I use 
main =    Html.programWithFlags
        { init = init
        , view = view
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        }
then I don't know how to initialize my model on that page
It should be something rather simple, but I don't know how to link my new view to the Elm new view.

U5ABF3BH7 : My explanation is a bit long... Sorry
U23SA861Y : are you doing serverside routing or client side?
U5ABF3BH7 : I am using rails
U5ABF3BH7 : I get the data from the database
U23SA861Y : typically what you'll have is some manner of restful endpoint to retrieve and update records via web request and then the app pulls it down and decodes it when it wants to use it
U5ABF3BH7 : I am doing server side for now, hoping to do client side later.
U5ABF3BH7 : <@U23SA861Y> Do you have any simple examples?
U23SA861Y : not off hand no.... at least nothing I can release
U5ABF3BH7 : Ok, thanks anyways.
