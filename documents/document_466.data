        on "keyup" (JD.map handler toTuple)```
since list takes `Value` and my single encoder returns `User`, but my `UserEncoder` returns a `Value`
Which handles the entering and deleting of items. Not sure how to handle a cut and paste
<@U6HCJ8JHM> you put those `Value`s in a `List` and pass it to <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Encode#list>
If you've got a `List User` you can `List.map` your encoding function to get a `List Value`
ah ok. i just had to put `List` in front of map and hit save in vscode haha
thanks for the help <@U153UK3FA>
Is there a `paste` and `cut` event?
hello
How to update an element of a list?
i mean
i have a list of tasks
i update a task
it makes the changes
but on the ui
it apears after reloading the page
<@U6B7NBTLZ> What do you mean you update the task?
A code snippet would be helpful here.
Did anybody ever encounter this?
is there an `elm-package.json` within `elm/tests`?
there isn't right now. I tried running `elm test init` to create one, but it didn't make a difference
I'll try again though
yeah, `elm-test init` assumes a certain project structure. You can use <https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-test-runner/blob/master/templates/tests/elm-package.json> as a template, though you'll need to add the path to your regular elm files to the `source-directories`
after that, you can run `elm-test --add-dependencies elm/tests/elm-package.json` to sync other dependencies
with a little luck, that should get you going
<@U3SJEDR96> I just realised that I had not properly setup the `source-directories`, it now indeed goes past that step :slightly_smiling_face:
I already tried deleting all `elm` folders I could think of (`elm-stuff`, `tests/elm-stuff`, `~/.elm`) but I still get this. in order to install `gdotdesign/elm-ui`, I had to rely on `elm-github-install`, not sure if/how that's related. any clue?
ah I think it is somehow related to <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-package/issues/253> will check my versions
Possibly, thoughI think it's more `elm-install` is messing things up, since `elm-test` runs `elm-package install`. I think <@U0EUHKVGB> came up with a way to get it working, though I don't remember exactly what it was. Also, <@U0K7EBT3J> was facing the same issue, maybe they know.
thanks a lot again!

i need a updateTasks function
<@U6B7NBTLZ> so, model.tasks is a list of tasks?
Yes
<@U6B7NBTLZ> values in Elm are immutable, they can't be changed, you can only create new values. So to update a task in that list you create a new list with the updated task in place of the old task.
undestood
but
i edit mai tasks name and description
in my updateTasks function
what comparation should i make
in the if statement
shoult i compare the list of tasks with model.tasks
?
Your `updateTasks` function will need to take the list of tasks and the new task as parameters
And return a new list of tasks
You'll need some way to match the new task value against its old value so you can find it in the list
Commonly this is an `id` field on the task
yes
Task has an id
so
updateTasks : List Task -&gt; Task -&gt; List Task
Right
?
Yep
<@U3SJEDR96> indeed, this made it work (all credits to <@U0K7EBT3J>) <https://elmlang.slack.com/archives/C0CLGCMMF/p1498829721172985>
:thumbsup: great!
While the beginner is super active right now. Does anyone know how I can handle cut and paste in a form?
copy/paste in the browser is (unreasonably) complicated. Using an existing JS library and ports is _probably_ your best bet
though I do wonder - cut and paste in forms should just work, so it depends on what you ctually want to do :wink:
<@U3SJEDR96> that is not what I wanted to hear (re it being complicated) :disappointed:
So far I have it so that I can type in a number and delete a number
`on "keyup"` triggers a port which is to `libphonenumber-google` doing AsYouType Formatting
I also capture the `delete` keys which resets the formatter and resends the current state of the form. However cut and paste is pretty much buggered at this stage
whats the exact problem with handling copy / paste?
The cut and paste is visibly done. However is immediately reset to the state.
I don't know how to trigger an update from them and to update the state with the new state of the input field
I think it would be relatively easy if there was an `oncut` event like there is in JS. But there doesn't seem to be these events in the Html.Events of Elm
well you can always `on "cut" decodeTheEvent`, though I'm not sure what information you'd decode from it
other than "it happened"
I had tried that.. But it didn't seem to work. I will try it again
are you catching the "input" or "change" events?
wouldn't input be triggered if you paste?
Important to know - if the decoder fails, it will simply do nothing
but yeah, I'd think input and change would be triggered, though if you're basing things on keyup, it might start to get weird
yea input overrides the keyup. I will have a look at change. I wasn't aware of this event
for reference this is where I am at
