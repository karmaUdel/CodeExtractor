U4Z4NEUQG : I'm diving in elm code after 2 week break, it's so easy to get back into, I don't need to re-create a full mental image of the app, I can just continue where I left.
U4Z4NEUQG : I read there way no "official support", but do you know what is the elm browser support?
U4Z4NEUQG : And if some browser is not supported, can we easily polyfill it? I saw somewhere that Object.assign was necessary.
U3SJEDR96 : Compiler compiles to ~ES3, mostly. RequestAnimationFrame is also used, but has a builtin fallback.
U3SJEDR96 : I don't think Object.assign is used at all, or at least not in core+vdom
U4Z4NEUQG : Apparently it is used only in dev tools (searching the mailing list now). So I guess it's safe.
U4Z4NEUQG : But I guess it would help to throw "wide browser support" somewhere on the elm home page. I am working with a lot of enterprises still under IE 9.
U41NK9BM4 : The bleeding edge, apparently
U3SJEDR96 : oh, indeed, elm-hot-loader (which I also encountered on my GH search) seems to be about the only thing, but that's only tangential anyway
U4Z4NEUQG : Yeah
U1G51S63S : Hi folks! What do you think is the best way to make a tree-like structure? I have this types ```type alias AreasTree =    { id : String
    , name : String
    , path : String
    , children : AreasTreeChildren
    }


type AreasTreeChildren
    = AreasTreeChildren (List AreasTree)
```

and get just a plain list via API where `path` is a key like `a.b.c`

U1G51S63S : at the end I want tree like AreasTree(a) -&gt; children (AreasTree(b)) -&gt; children(AreasTree(c))
U1G51S63S : I think fold will fit my needs, but I am not sure what is the best way to put `c` for example into nested structure
U1G51S63S : what I get from API is a list of ```type alias Area =    { id : String
    , name : String
    , path : String
    }```

U34MW57SN : hi. So I have a bit of experience doing elm - have a few simple things in production but havent written elm in a few months. I would like to follow a series to nail the basics again and get onto much more advanced tutorials. Any recommendations (free is best)
U2W8J47KQ : if you haven't done it already, I found <https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/> to be very helpful
U1G51S63S : <@U0LPMPL2U> thanks, reading it already :thumbsup:
U1T0RKXDX : Hey everybody, I wanted to ask if some of you are from Slack, and if we could find a way to have a great slack plan to have access to history ?
U101G7VEX : I'm interested in building an interactive map with Elm (like this <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ir26ue9lftzoqzr/2017-06-26%20at%2019.14.png>) and I'm not really sure what the best approach would be. Has anyone done anything similar and can share some tips?
U0EUHKVGB : <@U0CK8CJ5D>’s your person for maps in Elm :slightly_smiling_face:
U0EUHKVGB : <@U1T0RKXDX> We already have slack history
