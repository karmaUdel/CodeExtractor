yeah .elm-overlay { z-index: 999; } did the trick
I haven't had that issue before but I would just include some inline CSS that makes its z-index higher perhaps?
ahh I see you just did that
<@U1G51S63S>: maybe you have a redirect-rule that returns the index for a route not found, which leads to linking it twice?
(meaning, i now read your issue, and this is all i have to offer :slightly_smiling_face: )
<@U1AN4JRFV> thought about this already. removed routing (navigation/url-parser) at all - didn't helped :disappointed:
i'd click through all the responses in the dev-console after a fresh reload and check if any of them returned the index.
other than index.html, of course
nope, it's not. google maps really loaded twice btw. first time w/o api key and second one with it
so, did you get it? is it mapping?
no, I still have no idea why it's loading twice
I am just added debug log to `googleMap` function (which returns Html.node) and it's called once
so, it’s loading as a response to that DOM element being created, you could compare the stack trace for the two loads
maybe something funny is going on with the DOM node being created twice, or the attribute added later or something
I decided to go with Elm for a major project, contrary to RedInk's advice to start small
I don't regret it
absolutely amazing!
