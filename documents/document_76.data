       (is (= "" (c/singletest cert))))) ```
throws me java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Malformed member expression, expecting (.member target ...)
any idea??
someone has worked with certificates before :sob::sob:
what is c?
c/singletest looks like a syntax error
oh sorry no it's not
god I'm tired
no worries
this (.X509CertImpl)
is invalid syntax
I think you want (new X509CertImpl) or (X509CertImpl.) (latter preferred generally)
