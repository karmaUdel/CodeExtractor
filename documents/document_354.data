U5J08KX0D : Hi folks. What's the best way to play sounds? The Howler js library is fantastic (does cross browser really well) - if there's no agreed-upon Elm solution, ought I learn about ports?  - thanks again!

U3SJEDR96 : Ports are probably best, yeah
U62KVQVD1 : Any idea why can I be getting following error: "Cannot find variable `=&gt;`" ?
U62KVQVD1 : Is this something what was deprecated? Operator =&gt; ?
U62KVQVD1 : <https://gist.github.com/korczis/ed88388c2188fd39550d1b0a49a36448>
U5A726ZAR : <@U5GJ5FEAU> which video is that? I cant find it in the Elm Europe 2017 playlist
U3SJEDR96 : <@U62KVQVD1> it's not defined in `core`. It's defined in a util module in `elm-spa-example`though. Basically', it's this:```
(=&gt;) : a -&gt; b -&gt; (a, b)
(=&gt;) = (,)
infixl 0 =&gt;
```

U62KVQVD1 : <@U3SJEDR96> I see, thanks
U62KVQVD1 : Writing SPA in elm is quite hard :disappointed: Any ideas when elm 0.19 will get released?
U41NK9BM4 : BTW, `=&gt;` operator will be available in 0.19 by default
U3SQ42JJW : Hi everyone. I am just sitting here and think if my code is as pure functional as it should be.For Example I have a function 
```
getUsers : Model -&gt; List User
getUsers model = 
    model.users
```
Later in the code I use the following function:
```
getAllUserNames: Model -&gt; List String
getAllUserNames model = 
    List.map (...) (getUsers model)
```

U3SQ42JJW : This is not pure and should be avoided, I would say… or?
U41NK9BM4 : Why do you think isn't pure ?
U3SQ42JJW : right way would be ```
getAllUsers : List User -&gt; List String 
```

U62KVQVD1 : <@U41NK9BM4> I am afraid if I will be able to migrate my code to 0.19
U3SJEDR96 : getUsers doesn't work, though
U3SQ42JJW : beacause I reference a function that is not in scope…
U3SJEDR96 : <@U62KVQVD1> Usually there are tools to help with that, which should make it a breeze
U62KVQVD1 : <@U3SJEDR96> Ok, so there is hope …
U41NK9BM4 : korczis: Languages changes in 0.19 will be really minor. The changes in the library might affect your SPA though.
U62KVQVD1 : I am bit scared from this comment in SPA example
`
-- WARNING: this whole file will become unnecessary and go away in Elm 0.19,
-- so avoid putting things in here unless there is no alternative!
`

U3SQ42JJW : <@U41NK9BM4> it just doesn fell pure. I use a function in a function that i did not pass via an argument… I can just magically access this function
U41NK9BM4 : AFAIK routing will be simplified.
