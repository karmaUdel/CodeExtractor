How to integrate ```time_elapsed = time.time() - start_time``` in my while loop ?
How do you think? That tells you how long has passed. When a certain time has passed, you'll want to break out of the loop (if you want to restart the script), or get a new token/key (if you don't)
sorry I'm newbie in python. Can I add this in while loope whith if, and when certain time has passed to call my function for new key ?
Before the loop, when you get the token for the first time: `start_time = time.time()`
