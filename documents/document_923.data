U6EN2E1LG : so youre saying get rid of the main()‘s and just slap a if __name__ ==  “__main__” on the bottom?
U5VGKQ2SY : no. scroll up to 11:30am. and read my reply to your previous msg
U5VGKQ2SY : Also read this
U6EN2E1LG : Here is the revised code
U6EN2E1LG : <@U5VGKQ2SY>
U5VGKQ2SY : remove line 167
U5VGKQ2SY : did you look at the link I sent you to the 'example'?
U6EN2E1LG : Yes I did? so how are you able to call main then?
U5VGKQ2SY : it just does.
U5VGKQ2SY : so this way, main() runs if this is run as a script... a stand-alone script.
U5VGKQ2SY : like, you create a hello world and run it from terminal by `python helloworld.py````
def main():
    print "Hello World"

if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
```

U6EN2E1LG : but I dont have scripts on my function Im using that function to call functions
U6EN2E1LG : but in raelity main is kinda of a useless function tbh
U6EN2E1LG : would you suggest getting rid of hte main functino?
U5VGKQ2SY : no
U5VGKQ2SY : find a way to make it work, not just w/ the `main()` function, but through it.
U6EN2E1LG : yea its not working ill just stick to calling the main function normally
U6EN2E1LG : I really do not how you're running it and its working? lol
U5VGKQ2SY : careful. Keep it civil. This IS 'calling the main function normally'
U5VGKQ2SY : I literally just copied and pasted your most recent code and ran it.
U5VGKQ2SY : You're close. And having it all segmented into various functions is will make it very easy for you to make the small tweaks that it needs.
U5VGKQ2SY : Stare at it... fight with it. It'll click.
U6EN2E1LG : Are you sure you are using the code I just posted on here?
U6EN2E1LG : 30 mins ago?
U6EN2E1LG : cuz idk man it aint clicking
U5VGKQ2SY : And I only did it to see if it would run, and if not... see what errors it produced. &lt;-- in fact, when you run it, what errors do you get?
U6EN2E1LG : It doesnt even run I get nothing
U6EN2E1LG : I run and then it stops
U5VGKQ2SY : yeah, well I was asked a username and password and all
U6EN2E1LG : I wasn't at all
U5VGKQ2SY : had to type that in then type it in again before it produced that main menu
U6EN2E1LG : maybe <http://repl.it|repl.it> doesn't run if __name statement
U5VGKQ2SY : hahaha maybe. I can't confirm or deny. But if it doesn't work, then so be it... change 158 and 159 to just call main(). And ask someone why it doesn't work the way we're talking about here. Now, back to your original question... It's obvious that lines 50 and 51 are not the correct spots to declare the lists. Did you look into passing lists to functions?
U6EN2E1LG : No I haven't
U6EN2E1LG : Well I believe i have been this entire time
U6EN2E1LG : Where would you recommend calling the lists?
U5VGKQ2SY : where do you think it should go? step through what you have, carefully. Did you write this out on paper first?
U6EN2E1LG : No I didn't 
U6EN2E1LG : I was thinking about putting it after menu but before the books function and then returning those values
U6EN2E1LG : That's pretty much the one problem I've been having this whole time lol
U5VGKQ2SY : no. that's the only thing you asked about. There are multiple probs :joy:
U5VGKQ2SY : like, line 129, type 'one' instead of '1'
U5VGKQ2SY : lines 12 and 13 in register() don't make sense.
U5VGKQ2SY : and much more. but one thing at a time.
U6EN2E1LG : Well 129 is just a print statement
U6EN2E1LG : So I can make it a little more clear if anything
U5VGKQ2SY : 109*
U6EN2E1LG : Again it's still a print statement
U6EN2E1LG : I'm deleting the list item by the index
U5VGKQ2SY : Line 109 says: `num = int(input("Which book would you like to find?"))`
U5VGKQ2SY : Line 129 says `num = int(input("Which book would you like to sell?"))`
U5VGKQ2SY : that's user input, not a print statement.
U6EN2E1LG : Oh my bad
U6EN2E1LG : Well that would work
U5VGKQ2SY : Lines 52 and 53:```
  for i in range(0, len(inventory)):
    print(inventory[i])
```
should be
```
for i in inventory:
    print(inventory)
```
but `i` should be more describptive, like `movie_title` or whatever.

U5VGKQ2SY : anyway... let's look at where you said you'd post the list
U5VGKQ2SY : &gt;  after menu but before the books function and then returning those valuesWhat would that look like?

U5VGKQ2SY : Since you mention 'returning values', how does register and login work? In your own words.
U6EN2E1LG : It would allow me to use this values into another function when I call a specific using the return values as parameters
U5VGKQ2SY : how do you see that code happening? can you type it up here?
U5VGKQ2SY : okay.. so I asked about this b/c that's not how `return` works
U5VGKQ2SY : let's start building this bad boy.I'm guessing the first step is that the user has to register, right?

U6EN2E1LG : yea
U6EN2E1LG : they create a username and a password
