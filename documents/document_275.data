\\\"pickerHeight\\\":0.3702000000000001}\""```
The field it's saying is missing is present, so i'm sure the error is something else
any ideas for what i can look at to find the problem?
<@U3KSN5MAL> what's with all the slashes?
<@U3KSN5MAL> the code you have on the JS side was fine, only the elm side had to change :slightly_smiling_face:
I'm guessing you removed the `JSON.parse`?
I'd go for: `JSON.parse` on the JS side, and passing the resulting object in through flags. On the Elm side, that means you'd take `Json.Encode.Value` as your flags type, and use `Json.Decode.decodeValue` on it to get a `Result String something`
yeah i got that part working
sorry should have posted
yeah, the slashes seem to indicate you're trying to run `decodeValue` on a JS string, basically
ah
so pass it in as a json string instead?
well, I'd try to pass in an actual object
what does the JS side of things look like, and what does the flags part look like in Elm?
