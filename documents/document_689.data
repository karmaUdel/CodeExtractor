api.add_resource(API_Root, '/')```
(Just one of many endpoints, but I chose the simplest one)
Changing the port number in `app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)` has no effect. The server restarts on the default port. :thinking_face:
Hey guys, have some questions for you Django users.. Im a fairly novice web developer and have started a small project with Django. I need it to have an updated list of Netflix shows and movies at all times. Since Netflix doesn't have an open API, would the most logical thing to do would be to create a scraper that gets that information from their website? I am a bit stuck on what would be the proper way to do this. Thank you for your help!
That's probably your only option if there's no unofficial source either. Be sure to check that you aren't breaking their terms of service with that, however. Scraping is often times okay, but some sites explicitly forbid it - especially if intending to resell the info
this is code <https://gist.github.com/pleegor/ae8086286533ce33cc92095d7049dce5>
it appears im missing something in `s3.Bucket(bucket_name).upload_file(file_name)`
i think i sorted things out (please correct me if im wrong)  upload_file requires the following: `Filename, Bucket, Key, ExtraArgs=None, Callback=None, Config=None` and key was missing
anybody know how I can use jquery to target specific elements that Django automatically brings up?
specifically I'm trying to click on a button if the Django generic form error element is visible to the user, but targeting the element directly always brings up the modal that is triggered by the button, or doesn't trigger at all if I use the visible selector 
Guys am having a problem deciding whether to use function or class base view with minimal angular or jquery for frontend
or start with function base then refactor
it all depends on what you like.
i prefer to stay as close to a function as possible before creating a class. however, there are great times to use a class and really depends on the use case. if you offer up some examples or ideas of what you are trying to do maybe someone has a way they have done it before.
