U3R7CKQRX : It 's triggered somewhere in this function withing the compiled Elm code `function onEffects(router, cmdList, state)`
U3R7CKQRX : I was setting up some ports when it happended but I can't really pinpoint what the cause is.
U3R7CKQRX : Has anybody seen this before?
U3R7CKQRX : when I debugged I saw that the `currentSubs` array looks like this `[undefined]`
U3R7CKQRX : thus it fails on this line `currentSubs[i](value);`
U3R7CKQRX : with you guessed it `undefined is not a function`
U3R7CKQRX : :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : Hm, Hot module reloading + changing subscriptions or something?
U3R7CKQRX : my subscriptions are basically static
U3SJEDR96 : Basically it's attempting to trigger a subscription that isn't there. Do you have code to reproduce anywhere? Does it work on a "clean" compile?
U3R7CKQRX : ```subscriptions : Model -&gt; Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
    Sub.batch
        [ updateCurrentDate UpdateCurrentDate
        , updateAppointments UpdateAppointments
        ]
```

U3R7CKQRX : it still fails on a clean compile
U3SJEDR96 : You don't have any custom effect modules, right?
U2DSBB76Y : david_hernandez: Maybe installing a  version in `yarn.lock` and have the team configure their editors to use `node_modules/.bin/elm-format` could be one solution?
U2DSBB76Y : I guess that doesn’t ‘enforce’ though.. :smile:
U1P6FFJ64 : That could be a solution. But there is a problem if anyone is working in two different projects. But don't worry, we found a different solution: a elm format check on the CI to block PRs that don't follow the formatting of the last version of elm format
U3R7CKQRX : <@U3SJEDR96> no I don't have any custom effects
U3R7CKQRX : (don't even know how to do that :slightly_smiling_face: )
U3SJEDR96 : alright. Curious. I don't suppose that code is available somewhere by any chance?
U3R7CKQRX : not really sorry this is work stuff
U3SJEDR96 : Right. Does it work if you comment out the subscriptions? Does it work with only one? If so, can we pinpoint which one?
U3R7CKQRX : let me check
U3R7CKQRX : so it's def not hot releading I commented that out
U3R7CKQRX : and amazingly the error still occurs with a Sub.none
U3R7CKQRX : weird
U3R7CKQRX : but I kind of have the feeling that it's more related to a port going into JS
U41NK9BM4 : <@U1N4KAHT6> Quick comparison between elm-visualization and elm-plot? It would help to have it, if possible.
U41NK9BM4 : That is… Is the approach fundamentally different from Elm-plot?
U3SJEDR96 : <@U3R7CKQRX> ah, reproduced it. It's a JS side thing, indeed - subscribing `undefined` to a port triggers that. <https://ellie-app.com/3DW84DP65tBa1/0>
U3SJEDR96 : or even just `app.ports.foo.subscribe()`
U3R7CKQRX : oh wow <@U3SJEDR96> thanks
U3R7CKQRX : that fixes it
U4PT7NG4V : Afternoon ElmiansAnyone got any suggestion on how to track whether the current browser tab is the active one? I believe checking window.blur/focus is a common way in JS land. But in Elm..? :slightly_smiling_face:

U3R7CKQRX : i'll remember that for next time
U17J54S2U : <@U4PT7NG4V> you mean something like this: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/page-visibility/latest> ?
U4PT7NG4V : Sounds exactly like it! :slightly_smiling_face: That's super
U17J54S2U : i’ve never used it though, but it’s maintained by `elm-lang` :smile:
U1N4KAHT6 : <@U41NK9BM4> the approach is fairly different, although elm-plot has changed a lot recently. elm-visualization is meant to be a fairly low-level toolkit suitable for implementing fairly custom visualizations (for example something like <https://ellie-app.com/3DR8Yd6sHBQa1/0>), whereas elm-plot roughly fits the charting library bill. So in summary, if you need a pretty standard chart, elm-plot makes that pretty easy, whereas if you need some help building something new, than elm-visualization should be a good friend
U4PT7NG4V : <http://caniuse.com/#feat=pagevisibility> That's promising too :slightly_smiling_face:
U4PT7NG4V : Thanks, <@U17J54S2U> ! I'll give it a go
U41NK9BM4 : <@U1N4KAHT6> Crystal clear. Thank you
U3YDBDP4Z : How do you peeps work with CSS files in your projects?
U3U2EA14G : <@U17R26VR8> <@U3SJEDR96> . Sorry, I've just gone out. I don't touch anything on DOM. I add material design lite css with elm and webpack. When I work on menu and I click on menu, the error appear.
U3SJEDR96 : <@U3U2EA14G> do you have this code anywhere on github?
U3U2EA14G : sorry,  It only have on my computer
U3U2EA14G : let me take a picture
U0FP80EKB : <@U3YDBDP4Z> We use a combination of css files and elm-css
U0FP80EKB : we store the css files in our server code (we use rails)
U3U2EA14G : <https://gist.github.com/tranhoangvuit/63e929cf3e7045a328c30c66ee2fb1dc>this is gist <@U3SJEDR96>

U3SJEDR96 : what is `layout.js`?
U3U2EA14G : ah, it's material design lite module.
U3SJEDR96 : Does the error still appear if you comment that out from HTML for a minute?
U3U2EA14G : wait a minute. let me try :smile:
U3U2EA14G : wow, it work
U3U2EA14G : so it conflict with material desgin js file.
U3SJEDR96 : :tada:
U3SJEDR96 : well, the material design JS seems to add/change/remove/replace DOM elements, which tends to really confuse Elm and can give very unexpected results
U3U2EA14G : Thank you so much <@U3SJEDR96> . I think i need to change material design js file.
U3U2EA14G : btw, if i build a website with elm and golang. So I will use golang for build html and url, elm only used for single page. Is it ok ?
U3U2EA14G : But I don't know how to pass parameter or session via elm.
U0CLDU8UB : I have a functional thinking problem. I have a trail, which is really just a `List (List Point)` and a list of explosions. I also have a function that can take an explosion and a trail and cut the trail with the explosion. My problem is, how do I cut the trail with several explosions?
Here's my current implementation, which only takes the first explosion from the list and all the others are discarded:
```
breakIfNecessary : List Explosion -&gt; Trail -&gt; Trail
breakIfNecessary explosions trail =
    explosions
        |&gt; List.head
        |&gt; Maybe.map (breakTrail trail)
        |&gt; Maybe.withDefault trail
```

U0CLDU8UB : I tried formulating this into a fold, but I got confused. Hmm.. maybe a recursion would serve me better.
U0CLDU8UB : Yes, recursion it is (and flipping the arguments on breakTrail)```
breakIfNecessary : List Explosion -&gt; Trail -&gt; Trail
breakIfNecessary explosions trail =
    case explosions of
        [] -&gt;
            trail

        exp :: rest -&gt;
            trail
                |&gt; breakTrail exp
                |&gt; breakIfNecessary rest
```

U0CLDU8UB : Thank you! :rubberduck:
U0CLDU8UB : <@U3U2EA14G> Sure, it's perfectly okay to use Go on the backend.
U3U2EA14G : But I don't know how to pass from page to page. Example I use go render two pages html is index.html can cart.html. In index.html how I call elm file ? (Elm.Main.embed(mountNode) and if I choose product from index.html  and how can it pass it in cart.html ?
U0CLDU8UB : So usually people make Elm applications either as- a self-contained interactive part of a mostly static web page, or
- a full "web app", also called Single Page Application (SPA), where all the navigation etc. actually happens within the index.html

U0CLDU8UB : You could for example make your shopping cart in the cart.html page with Elm, and have the rest of the page be a traditional HTML page.
U3U2EA14G : so can we use ELM build a list component. example index_component.elm, cart_component.elm ... ? And from it. we will integrate it in html file ?
U0CLDU8UB : Yeah, that should work.
