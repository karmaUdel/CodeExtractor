U0LPMPL2U : Could you have:```
type Call
  = HungUp
  | Active PauseStatus HoldStatus
```

U23SA861Y : also works
U23SA861Y : you can limit impossible states, but impossible state transitions need to be encoded into the update
U37HUSJ4R : interesting
U37HUSJ4R : so what would `PauseStatus`?
U0LPMPL2U : ```type PauseStatus = Paused | Unpaused
type HoldStatus = OnHold | Live
```

U23SA861Y : bools would also work there with type aliases
U23SA861Y : the named constructors are a bit more descriptive however
U0LPMPL2U : The type gives you extra safety though
U0LPMPL2U : because you can't accidentally pass the hold boolean when you meant to pass the paused boolean
U0LPMPL2U : You might also model this as:```
type RecordingStatus = Paused | Recording

type Call
  = HungUp
  | OnHold RecordingStatus
  | Active RecordingStatus
```

U0LPMPL2U : That way the tags on `Call` represent all the call states, each of which may or may not have an associated `RecordingStatus`
U37HUSJ4R : very interesting!
U37HUSJ4R : guess to make it more confusing though :wink: what happens if I need the statues to be `Maybe`?
U37HUSJ4R : because we don't always know the state of the call
U37HUSJ4R : eg its loading
U37HUSJ4R : or maybe just add a constructor for `Loading`?
U0LPMPL2U : yup
U37HUSJ4R : is there a point you'd think this is getting silly though? for example:`  | Active PhoneNumber PauseStatus HoldStatus TransferStatus SomethingElse More`

U23SA861Y : at some point I might drop to a record instead of a list
U0LPMPL2U : `HoldStatus` and `TransferStatus` are both tied to call state, not an active call right?
U23SA861Y : probably at anything more than two
U37HUSJ4R : no, it's an active call
U0LPMPL2U : Hmmmm, I was thinking something like:
```
type Call
  = HungUp
  | Loading
  | OnHold RecordingStatus
  | Transfer
  | Active RecordingStatus
```

U0LPMPL2U : All of these are different states that a call could be in
U37HUSJ4R : yes
U0LPMPL2U : I'm thinking `RecordingStatus` only makes sense for `Active` calls
U37HUSJ4R : I'd agree
U37HUSJ4R : I think that last type is pretty much spot on
U0LPMPL2U : You can think of it as "a call can be in one of N states, some of which have extra data associated (such as recording status)"
U37HUSJ4R : thank you for the help
U37HUSJ4R : great to be able to chat through these questions
U0LPMPL2U : I'm glad we found a nice solution :slightly_smiling_face:
