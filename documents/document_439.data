hello, can anyone give me a good tutorial on using ELM with REST? specially, fetching and posting contents, as well as authentication
<@U2PTZFKFX> I did a tiny bit of googling and found this <https://github.com/andrewsuzuki/elm-todo-rest-api> did you see that already?
<@U2PTZFKFX> it probably won't help you with authentication, but that's probably a separate issue and you can treat them individually.
this is not fully descriptive
<@U2PTZFKFX> well, do you know elm enough to build yourself a small app from the beginning, say the counter app example? if not, it's a good idea to learn how to do that first.
<@U6EAT2Z37>  I have read the basic of it, and i want to integrate into a real application development,  a flask application i m building
unrelated to current convo but thanks for that link, composed. one of the better documented github projects i've seen actually. very helpful for me.
If you follow this through, it should hopefully give you enough insight into being able to understand what you need to know to proceed.
ok
<@U6EAT2Z37> thanks,
yes, thanks again! This one looks really good too
<@U6EAT2Z37>  do you have any idea bout http request and saving the json data?
<@U2PTZFKFX> not sure what you mean by "save" :slightly_smiling_face: (or, actually, for that matter, what context you're talking about http requests in)
i mean pulling the data and using it
That's exactly what that last tutorial helps you with, doesn't it?
i thought it's for json decoding only, let me read further,
<@U6D3ERLA1> <@U6EAT2Z37> when working with `Array`, I find it feels like to make an `Array.update : Int -&gt; ( a -&gt; a ) -&gt; Array a -&gt; Array a` on top of `set` and `get`. Or use <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/array-extra/1.0.2/Array-Extra#update>
Using an `indexedMap` feels like you don't really need an Array in the first place
<@U3SJEDR96> sure. it makes me wish lenses existed, but oh well, not a beginner topic, apparently :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U3SJEDR96> a much better solution, of course, because indexedMap is O(n) (ie it takes the size of the array to do its work)
<@U3SJEDR96> I was more referring to the compositional style than anything else. Doing indexedMap is not good.
this might sound like a dumb question, but does anyone know a boilerplate for an Elm app that uses an express server to serve the index.html?
I was looking for something more integrated than having to run two commands (one to start the server, and another to start the elm-reactor/live/webpack/wtv)
Huh? elm-reactor and elm-live also serve the static files. 
And so does webpack, given it's configured to do so 
hi everybody
I'm looking for help with sort of a recursion problem
I want to draw the edges of a polygon. So I wrote a function `polygonLines : List Point -&gt; List Line`
where `Point` is of course `(FLoat, FLoat)` and `Line` is `(Point, Point)`
so the easy part is  `x1 :: x2 :: xs -&gt; Line x1 x2 :: polygonLines (x2 :: xs)`
but I can't figure out an elegant way to close the polygon, because the last point will not be connected to the first point. Does anyone have a good idea that doesn't involve just appending the first point to the end of the list of points in my polygon list of points?
<@U6GFNSEPR> consider to convert your code to tail recursion and implement the zero condition accordingly to include the correct last point
<@U6GFNSEPR> have a look at the polygon element in the svg package, you just need to provide list of point

Has the community converged on some particular css library ? elm-css vs elm-style-elements vs something_else ..
Is there a general name for `type alias Something a = { current : Maybe a, others : List a }`
<@U6DQCTZT2> parameterized record type, I suppose. Depending on what part in particular you're trying to name.
I generally call it a parameterized type
<@U6EAT2Z37> I meant the pattern of using current and other, I know there's ziplists but they are prev, curr, remaining
Oh. Sorry I'm not sure about that. I think that that (the thing you're referring to that has list then an element, then a list) is called a Zipper, not a ZipList, by the way. A ZipList is something else.
Oddly, it leads to a stack overflow.  Where should I look to find the trouble?
<@U6EAT2Z37> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcgmSRJHu_8&amp;t=894s> using Zip List here, but he might be wrong.
I'm reducing a commutative function (application order doesn't matter). Should I use `foldl` or `foldr`?
How do I insert a `&lt;br&gt;` tag in a text? Something like `text "one&lt;br&gt;two&gt;` does not work
(Beginner myself) but I think maybe something like `Html.div [Html.text "one", <http://Html.br|Html.br>, Html.text "two"]` would work
I don't see `br` defined, so maybe that should be modified to `Html.div [Html.text "one", Html.node "br" [] [], Html.text "two"]`
Scratch that, I found it <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/latest/Html#br>
