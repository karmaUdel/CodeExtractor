U153UK3FA : <@U26LR8F4H> do you want to re-render before scrolling to the top?
U26LR8F4H : that would be a nice touch :slightly_smiling_face:
U23SA861Y : mm, also a good question. It might make sense to bounce through an update
U23SA861Y : and just have a `Pageupdate` message
U23SA861Y : which then issues a scroll
U26LR8F4H : thanks, i think  i have some fiddling todo.
U153UK3FA : <@U26LR8F4H> if you want to re-render then you need to go through `update` which you can't do by chaining Tasks
U26LR8F4H : So the first task issues an http request then the andThen will run before the update function is called?
U23SA861Y : yes, when you chain with `andThen` the tasks are carried out in sequence behind the scene
U23SA861Y : only dispatching a message when the chain is complete and returning early if any issues an error
U26LR8F4H : hmm, in my update function the task doesn't seem to run ```            ( IndexLoaded (Ok index), _ ) -&gt;                ( { model | pageState = Loaded (Index index) }, Task.perform (\_ -&gt; Noop) scrollToTop )
```

U26LR8F4H : it runs when the first update i called though, i shoved a console.log in the native module to check it :stuck_out_tongue:
U23SA861Y : it should be issued for every IndexLoaded message
U23SA861Y : as you have written it there any who
U26LR8F4H : well, if I use a port then all is well.  I'm not sure if this is an elm bug or my bug.  I'm going to guess it's mine somehow :stuck_out_tongue:
U23SA861Y : I have yet to encounter an elm bug, short of a known compiler error
U26LR8F4H : hmmm strange ```scrollToTop : Task x ()scrollToTop =
    let
        _ =
            Debug.log "scrollToTop" "called"
    in
        Dom.Scroll.toTop "body"
            |&gt; Task.onError (\_ -&gt; Task.succeed ())
```

U26LR8F4H : that is getting called even after i removed the task from the update
U23SA861Y : yeah it would get called on load
U23SA861Y : elm is eager
U23SA861Y : so it will be called when the let is evaluated and thats when the program loads
U26LR8F4H : oh, interesting
U23SA861Y : scrollToTop is  a value not  a function
U23SA861Y : it gets constructed on program start
U26LR8F4H : well, that is super helpful to know, thank you.
U3SJEDR96 : This sounds remarkably close to what I did with elm-demystifyin-decoders :grin: excited to see what you come up with!
