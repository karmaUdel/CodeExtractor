U21U8SZ2P : at some point, gonna rework it so the user picks which channel they want to broadcast to. but we're also talking about allowing people to put the bot's daily updates in a channel too, so i'd probably wanna do those things together
U04SM6T2H : ah cool
U04SM6T2H : good idea
U0HBN0L9M : yeah, that's the trick I used with <http://Skillz.io|Skillz.io> and Stop Breathe Think : you don't need to ask your user any input other than "is it ok to post in <#C04SM6TAK|general>?"
U0HBN0L9M : you can circle through public channels, there'll be always one and only one with is_general:true
U0HBN0L9M : this reduce friction
U0HBN0L9M : anything that reduces friction makes onboarding better
U0HBN0L9M : but I guess this work mostly for intro/onboarding/discovery only. in most cases, the user won't want to have notifications broadcasted in <#C04SM6TAK|general>. So the next step is usually to give her the option to choose another channel
U3AJTK54G : with my chat bot, is there a way to see who did an @ at it for my response?
U3AJTK54G : user returns the user id it looks like
U3AJTK54G : ```def parse_slack_output(slack_rtm_output):    """
        The Slack Real Time Messaging API is an events firehose.
        this parsing function returns None unless a message is
        directed at the Bot, based on its ID.
    """
    output_list = slack_rtm_output
    if output_list and len(output_list) &gt; 0:
        for output in output_list:
            if output and 'text' in output and AT_BOT in output['text']:
                # return text after the @ mention, whitespace removed
                return output['text'].split(AT_BOT)[1].strip().lower(), \
                       output['channel'], output['user']
    return None, None, None```

U1DDKQPGB : Some great ideas here for bCRM. Appreciate the insight 
U28PHTLLB : anyone looking for a job in the Raleigh Durham, Triangle area?
U0HT1NBLH : might want to post in <#C0DC1BM24|jobs>
U0HBN0L9M : BTW <@U1DDKQPGB> just read your piece on cross platforms chatbots
U0HBN0L9M : good insight too :slightly_smiling_face:
U1DDKQPGB : Thanks <@U0HBN0L9M> more an open question than my usual "opinion" pieces
U3AUDGX19 : hi
U3AUDGX19 : I am looking to define a Chatbot for passing on Shift handover information
U3AUDGX19 : (i) Design a bot and define different labels depending on the category of information that needs to be passed on to next shift as part of Shift Handover.For Example: Labels can be "#Incidentfollowup" , "#KeyThingsToNote#, "#Changealert".

(ii) So, any admin types the information in Slack, which he needs to handover to next shift, and suffix that with one the labels, as defined in example above, plus with a Flag ON or OFF, depending on the validity of that information
.The Labels will help Bot program to segregate the information into those categories. So, Whenever admin in the next Shift queries,  for example, "@bot which incidents I need to followup on? ", Bot will present the admin with all the information that is tagged under label "#Incidentfollowup" and with Flag ON. 
Once the task is completed and information is no longer valid , the last admin who completed the task, can set the Flag OFF for that information.

U3AUDGX19 : is there anyone that can help me with coding?
U0T1G849W : Looking for Python developers to help test our Chatbot Live Take Over.  We just added a Python connector today.  Without leaving Slack you can pause and take over your chatbot and engage your users directly, then resume your bot.  Just drop in the Python SDK into your bot code, and add Wordhop to Slack.   Here's an example of the integration.   <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAcwr3s9l4o>
U2VMTE1FD : this is really cool, but how does it know when you dont have a response?
U2VMTE1FD : typically when i build a chatbot it always has SOME kind of response
U2VMTE1FD : even if its just i dont know what youre talking about
U2VMTE1FD : for example, how did it know that the smiley was a non response?
U37C5V3HT : Is this middleware functioning that was uploaded 8 months ago? <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/examples/middleware_example.js>
U04SM6T2H : Abinash I answered your questions over in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit>
U37C5V3HT : Just read <@U04SM6T2H> thanks :simple_smile: 
U372J18DA : i require invite code to sign up for the botkit, how do i get started with botkit meanwhile? or do i need to wait for the confirmation ?
U37C5V3HT : <@U372J18DA> the invite is only for botkit studio. In order to use botkit, you just have follow its setup instructions under howdy/botkit readme.md file. Set up using node.js 
U372J18DA : ok, and what is included in the botkit studio?
U3236DR4Z : Hi all, my app/bot shows inactive account  when i try to send message. How can i fix it
U04SM6T2H : <@U372J18DA> Botkit Studio is a set of APIs and hosted tools for authoring content, setting triggers, measuring use
U04SM6T2H : If you'd like early access I'm happy to grant you!
U04SM6T2H : that goes for anyone here :slightly_smiling_face:
U3C6HV20G : Hi I am new here, I want to create a bot here, but I don't know how to start
U3C6HV20G : Can anybody help me?
U38K8F4ER : I think this page is a good starting point: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/readme-slack.md>
U38K8F4ER : here is the example bot: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/slack_bot.js>
U38K8F4ER : <@U3C6HV20G>
U272P5K71 : We also recently put these together if you're looking for Python or Ruby: <https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Python-Onboarding-Tutorial>

U272P5K71 : <https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Ruby-Onboarding-Tutorial>
U272P5K71 : They give a pretty good overview of what's involved building Events API handlers and Event responders
U3C6HV20G : Thanks very much
U1DDKQPGB : In case you don't see this on the FB Bots Group... I just published the presentation I gave at the Slack Meetup NY "How Can We Trust Chatbots?" <http://www.slideshare.net/PaulWalsh11/slack-meetup-new-york-how-can-we-trust-chatbots>
U0HUZ214H : Nice deck <@U1DDKQPGB>! Before choosing to build a bot building platform (I know, right?), our other option was to try something with bot to bot communications. I'm still always thinking about that. Is your team or anyone else you know doing something in that sub-space?
Also, your title made me think the talk was more about bot infosec. Who's "killing it" in that space, if you know? Or anyone else?

U1DDKQPGB : <@U0HUZ214H>: MetaCert is killing it in the infosec space. And I know what you mean re title. I think I might need to change it in the future. 
Nobody is doing bot to bot yet but it's absolutely coming... 

U0HBN0L9M : <@U0D7LHNTX> had a funky experiment re bot to bot. Nobody did a serious proof of concept of a working product, as far as I know
U0D7LHNTX : <@U0HBN0L9M>: you can't just leave me hanging like this! Tell me more :sweat_smile:
U1DDKQPGB : bCRM allowed you to see every bot installed by your teams and then message them - but seemed creep and couldn't think of a reason for people to do it. So we removed it. Should we add it back?
U0HUZ214H : Thanks <@U1DDKQPGB> and haha, I KNEW <@U0D7LHNTX> would be summoned by any talk of B2B (Bot to Bot)!
U0HUZ214H : <@U1DDKQPGB> yes! I have a lot of thoughts in this area but I also want to build some of of it too :slightly_smiling_face:. The general thought is "chaining".
U1DDKQPGB : Slack doesn't permit it but it will come. Think of installing bestbuy bot which then introduces the Samsung, [supplier name here] without the need to install those bots. 
U0D7LHNTX : Actually I was summoned by someone mentioning me ;) I see the context for the convo now. 
U0D7LHNTX : Hrm wrapping one Bot inside another Bot, there's an interesting idea… :bulb: 
U1DDKQPGB : <@U0D7LHNTX> I see it more scalable if a bot has the ability to invite other bots to a conversation/channel without having to be "wrapped". Imagine if Walmart had thousands of suppliers it might want to invite different ones as they are built over time and without having to build and release a new bot themselves. Thoughts?
U0D7LHNTX : A) it sounds amazing. B) it sounds like an IT security nightmare. Question is: how to find the balance. 
U1DDKQPGB : I agree with bot. I've started a conversation with a big bot making platform about adding a layer of security - it would be something like 'Verified by MetaCert' so only trusted bot sources with specific unique IDs would be permitted access via the bot - to prevent phishing bots before they start.
U3DTR7TE3 : Hello!
U3DTR7TE3 : coding a bot to bot framework
U3DTR7TE3 : weee
U0HUZ214H : Dang. Now I really have FOMO.
U0D7LHNTX : <@U3DTR7TE3>: tell us more!
U37C5V3HT : Don't you think moving the entire readme.md files from github's botkit's repo and host them somewhere under <https://howdy.ai/botkit/> woukd be nice? Because right now, there are so many readme files and it's not intuitive to follow them by clicking related links and scrolling up and down multiple times. By hosting them under <https://howdy.ai/botkit/> where we can structure the content from getting started guide, knowing its functions, events, and steps in sequence that can help even a novice user to an expert developer. What do you think? :thinking_face:
U0V93GE5R : <@U37C5V3HT>: working on it :) major refactor of the docs for reference and readability are in progress. 
U3DHFP43W : Hi guys! Can you help me? I need to connect Slack API with my Ruby app.  I need when I push the button slack sending me some request tu mi request URL. Maybe someone know how to do it? or have some tutorial or manual?
U3C6UAKDY : Hi all, We are now launching our closed beta for slack bots!

U3DHFK13M : Hi Guys! I'm working with a FB messenger bot and <http://LUIS.ai|LUIS.ai>, having trouble recognising different intents coming through and it's defaulting to "hi" all the time... Can anyone point me to somewhere I could get some more info on this than just the middleware github?
U3DRPC9QT : Hey yall
U3DRPC9QT : About how long does it take for the invite code to be approved for botkit studio
U0V93GE5R : We aren't in an approval process right now but let me invite you to our preview room
U0Y7H2F3M : Hey all! This is Vikesh, I have worked at Slack as a Test Infrastructure Intern and previously at <http://Directi.com|Directi.com> twice as a Software engineering Intern.

U3EFK8UES : <@U0Y7H2F3M> I see you use sqlite3 in your projects, what advantages do you find using that over say shelve?(I'm currently working on a bot and looking into what sort of data storage system to use, and am currently using shelve)
U3ESHDMPH : can someone help me out with a snippet of a  question inside a question using botkit in  nodejs
U3ESHDMPH : ?
U0HUZ214H : <@U3ESHDMPH> you'll probably have better luck posting in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> or similar. Just ask your question there and someone should be able to help, possibly even me!
U3ESHDMPH : thanks done
U3EFK8UES : also <@U0Y7H2F3M> do you happen to know if there is a way to check a db for a version flag that can be altered to check if updats need to be made to the schemea
U3EFK8UES : Or anybody
U322K0W57 : Do you guys know anyone here: <https://www.designerhangout.co/> that can help with an invite to their Slack channel?
U3EBZKDDK : Hello! I'm not sure if this is right channel for this, but does anyone know how to handle direct message with bot without needing need to call out @botname
U3EFK8UES : Direct messages with come from a cahnnel starting with a D
U3EFK8UES : Does your token have access to other DM's or is it a nomrla bot token?
U3EFK8UES : <@U3EBZKDDK>
U3EBZKDDK : OH! I see it, didn't notice that that direct message starts with a d. I forgot to mention, I'm using the python slack client.
U3EBZKDDK : what do u mean by : Does your token have access to other DM's or is it a nomrla bot token?
U3EFK8UES : Me too!
U3EFK8UES : Python
U3EFK8UES : So did you just make a bot and use that token?
U3EFK8UES : For example, if your using an testing api token it has admin and cna read messages from anywhere
U3EFK8UES : so it will receive private messages from other poeple
U3EFK8UES : *poeple
U3EFK8UES : so if bob messages jim and you have admin token
U3EFK8UES : you'll see that message the the rtm_read
U3EFK8UES : but if its just a bot token you will only see it if bob messages the bot
U3EBZKDDK : yea, i created a custom bot user and use that token
U3EFK8UES : Yep
U3EFK8UES : so then you can just wait for channel to start with d
U3EFK8UES : and then know that this is going ot be a private message
U3EBZKDDK : Thanks! That was a big help.
U3EFK8UES : Yep yep! :smile:
U3EDTU85A : Hi guys! What are you using to automatic testing your bots?
U322K0W57 : <@U3EDTU85A> can you be more specific with your question please. Try and give us a few more details
U3DRPC9QT : <http://prntscr.com/dj3sgz>
U3DRPC9QT : But when I try to do it how its suppose to do it
U3DRPC9QT : It says "Token is unkown"
U3DRPC9QT : <http://prntscr.com/dj3snh>
U3DRPC9QT : Like
U3DRPC9QT : Am I doing something wrong?
U3EDTU85A : <@U322K0W57> I wondering how you write integration tests for your bots. Running your bot in a test environment without connecting it to an external server (like slack) , feed the bot with some inputs and make assertions for the outputs.

U3DRPC9QT : Nevermind - stupid as hell
U3DRPC9QT : Anyone know how I can pull from a SQL server?
U3EFK8UES : What framework and language?
U3DRPC9QT : Uhm
U3DRPC9QT : Webhook and js? <@U3EFK8UES>
U3DRPC9QT : But I can switch?
U3DRPC9QT : Never really made a bot or anything for slack
U3DRPC9QT : Open to anything
U3EFK8UES : Oh, wow aren't there a TON of js librarys for SQL server?
U3DRPC9QT : ¯\_(?)_/¯
U3DRPC9QT : Again - New to this
U3DRPC9QT : Do you know of any <@U3EFK8UES> ?
U0V93GE5R : what are you looking to do with botkit?
U3DRPC9QT : basically I was like - oi! Thats a nice way to make this webhook
U3DRPC9QT : I basically just need to pull recently added items to a sql server on like a 5 minute refresher.
U3DRPC9QT : but then - I didn't really understand studio
U3DRPC9QT : So I was like "Is there a better way"?
U3DRPC9QT : So yea <@U0V93GE5R>
U0V93GE5R : Recently added from where? Just trying to envision where botkit comes in here. 
U0V93GE5R : Fwiw we do have outgoing webhooks example here <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/tree/master/examples>
U3DRPC9QT : <http://prntscr.com/dj514n>
U3DRPC9QT : well...
U3DRPC9QT : I mean - not much help
U3DRPC9QT : Is that suppose to be like that?
U3DRPC9QT : And recently added to the sql server in a specific table.
U0V93GE5R : Yea we need add some more examples, that's why I was trying to understand your use case for consideration 
U3DRPC9QT : Oh.
U3DRPC9QT : I just want to pull recently added items to a specific table.
U0V93GE5R : I have to run but I'd encourage you to search this slack and read some of the examples posted here for tips. You might want to go through the starter kit to get a handle on how botkit works in general
U3DRPC9QT : ok
U3DRPC9QT : Thanks
U3DRPC9QT : hold up
U3DRPC9QT : I've changed to mySQL will that change anything?
U3DRPC9QT : I just need to query it tho
U3DRPC9QT : For the webhook - what would I put as the link if Im connecting to a SQL database?
U3DRPC9QT : It wouldn't be clickable.
U3DRPC9QT : Would anyone mind helping me code the complete project as a contributor? 
U3DRPC9QT : I'll give credit
U3DPX9V1N : Sorry for the n00b question but... about to submit my botkit enabled bot to the directory and can't find which scope will allow me to ask the installer which channel to post my onboarding welcome message to
U3DPX9V1N : tried channel:write but not getting prompted
U04SX1L23 : Hello. :slightly_smiling_face: I'm looking into building a slack app.. I'm wondering how some apps have extra config options on their app pages e.g. trello/github. Do I need to talk to the platform team at slack to get this level of customisation?
U0Y7H2F3M : <@U04SX1L23> Extra config options are available upon request.  You must have read this : <https://api.slack.com/slack-apps> 
for further questions related to Apps/App Directory, please post in <#C0K8617D5|slack-api> . :) :+1: 

U04SX1L23 : ah thank you!
U0Y7H2F3M : <@U3EFK8UES> Shelve is very slow compared to Sqlite3. I use shelve for testing purpose but not in production. 
Sqlite3 is very powerful and advanced. 
Read this [1] :  <http://eliang.blogspot.in/2011/07/python-shelve-vs-sqlite3.html>

U322K0W57 : guys, im trying to get the chatbot to say something the second someone clicks on the m.me link and messenger opens
U322K0W57 : i know botkit has access to 2 events
U322K0W57 : facebook_optin and message_referral
U322K0W57 : but none seem to be triggered
U322K0W57 : does anyone know why and how to make this work?
U0HBN0L9M : do you have a get started screen?
U1T7VHTKP : Has anyone used <http://XOR.ai|XOR.ai>?
U322K0W57 : <@U0HBN0L9M> What do you mean?
U322K0W57 : where do i set that up?
U322K0W57 : because i want to have an image and a button underneath
U322K0W57 : i basically want this
U322K0W57 : <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/generic-template>
U322K0W57 : to come up when they first get on the bot
U0HBN0L9M : your bot doesn't know about the user unless either the user sends a message, or, if you have a get started button, the user clicks on get started
U0HBN0L9M : just opening the dialog doesn't fire any event
U322K0W57 : i was afraid of that
U322K0W57 : so if someone comes from a m.me link it wont do anything
U322K0W57 : its weird that facebook has not included an event for that
U322K0W57 : what about if i use the facebook start message option, that shows the user an intro message when they first come in
U322K0W57 : because they have that
U322K0W57 : do you think botkit would detect anything there?
U322K0W57 : or it might just be the case where i tell the user to type something
U0HBN0L9M : with the Get Started option, you get the optin event
U0HBN0L9M : that's the point
U0HBN0L9M : then you can react
U0HBN0L9M : it does not leave the user with the blank page or the dreaded "hi"
U0HBN0L9M : but the user still does give you the permission to talk to him
U0HBN0L9M : it's made for your need. Just use it :slightly_smiling_face:
U322K0W57 : <@U0HBN0L9M>  can you send me a link on the Get Started option please?
U322K0W57 : <@U0HBN0L9M> So i found this: <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/get-started-button>
U322K0W57 : but how do i set it up to have that appear
U322K0W57 : oh, i got it
U322K0W57 : i need to run that cURL
U322K0W57 : interesting
U3EPYH5MG : Hi o/
U3EFK8UES : I'm assuming lack of answer is a no
U3ER5UTL2 : Hello, I've got a question about `files.sharedPublicURL`.  I want my bot to be able to make certain images that users share public (i.e., accessible by a public link), however, when I call `files.sharedPublicURL` for an image that somebody uploaded, I get back a `user_is_bot` error.  Is there any way around this, say by specifying a particular OAuth scope?  My bot is built on <http://Howdy.ai|Howdy.ai>'s botkit and running as part of a Slack app btw.  Thank you!!
U0HBN0L9M : <@U0HUTFBHS> "would you like to uninstall me" | "YES"
U21U8SZ2P : haha
U21U8SZ2P : agreed that it needs a “no” button, even if not answering it means a default “no” — enough users would go :thinking_face: at the current setup that providing that peace of mind with a “no” button seems like a no brainer
U0KNN1SBV : Anyone have a idea if you can active calls (soon with video) via deeplink from browser or slack message ?
U0V93GE5R : afaik its still no, but you could ask for an update in <#C0K8617D5|slack-api>
U0KNN1SBV : <@U0V93GE5R> thanks!
U3ES7AM6X : well hello!
U04S3JCH2 : :wave:
U3DRPC9QT : anyone good with web hooks?
U322K0W57 : guys, im working on a fcebook chatbot that uses a lot of gifs
U322K0W57 : can you give some tips on using gifs in facebook chatbots
U322K0W57 : for example, ive noticed that some gifs dont come trough
U322K0W57 : usually the ones that are more than 4MB
U322K0W57 : or around that
U322K0W57 : and we are talking about a resolution of 300x300
U322K0W57 : with 64 colors
U322K0W57 : any tips or ideas on this?
U322K0W57 : im hosting them on amazon S3
U3DRPC9QT : How would I use a webhook for a sql server?
U0Y7H2F3M : <@U322K0W57> You can compress all the gif and then host on AWS
U0Y7H2F3M : gifs more than 4 mb will take a lot of time to upload and I feel like gifs need not be of very high quality
U322K0W57 : <@U0Y7H2F3M> I do have them on S3 and then proxying trough Cloudflare
U322K0W57 : seems that facebook messenger usually lets gifs bigger than 3.6mb to timeout
U322K0W57 : its good to know
U0Y7H2F3M : yes
U322K0W57 : but thanks <@U0Y7H2F3M> I ended up resolving the issue in the end. Also resized the gifs to be a bit smaller and optimized them even more :wink:
U04SM6T2H : This looks interesting: <https://rasa.ai/>
U3ES7AM6X : So I am inviting discussion and critique on my latest story about bots. I am hoping that this group has some insights that might improve my perspective. I just published “Independent together (a Christmas bot metaphor)” <https://medium.com/dronzebot/independent-together-a-christmas-bot-metaphor-cbe5548d0096#.asdjue7u4>
U3DRPC9QT : For a webhook
U3DRPC9QT : What should I put as the url if I am trying to query a SQL server
U1ZMN2FD1 : anyone else getting a lot of 500s from slack in the last 10 minutes?
U3DRPC9QT : No? Because I dont know what URL to put
U1ZMN2FD1 : <@U3DRPC9QT> are you saying that you want an outgoing webhook to query a SQL server?
U3DRPC9QT : Incoming.
U3DRPC9QT : I want it to query every 5 minutes and get recently added items to a DB
U3DRPC9QT : Should it be outgoing <@U1ZMN2FD1> ?
U1ZMN2FD1 : every 5 minutes you want to post something into Slack?
U3DRPC9QT : Yea.
U3DRPC9QT : If possible <@U1ZMN2FD1>
U3ES7AM6X : does anyone here know how to get an ai domain?
U0Y7H2F3M : <@U3ES7AM6X> <https://www.eurodns.com/domain-extensions/ai-domain-registration> 
U3ES7AM6X : <@U0Y7H2F3M> danke!
U3ES7AM6X : <@U0Y7H2F3M> do you know if it can be transferred like other domains?
U0Y7H2F3M : <@U3ES7AM6X> Use <https://www.onlydomains.com> 

U3FGRUSLT : <http://hover.com|hover.com> is my fav domain place these days
U0HBN0L9M : how the hell installed localsdata everywhere
U0HBN0L9M : it's like all your kid's friends from kindergarten, getting in your house on a rainy day, running everywhere with their muddy shoes
U322K0W57 : :))
U322K0W57 : welcome <@U3GSQMA4W>  :slightly_smiling_face:
U3GSQMA4W : Thanks <@U322K0W57>  for the invite. :slightly_smiling_face:

U0F9T9KPH : Anyone from Slack around that can possibly help me? I'm account owner of a Slack team and someone, somehow, disabled my account.
U3G9W54HH : Is there a good resource on why some of the non-common standards for message types? I am not at all suggesting they are wrong, but they are unique - things like needing to stringify the "actions" but urlencode the rest of the body.
I ask to understand, not question the design decision :slightly_smiling_face:

U3G9W54HH : I haven't really liked the java libs out there, so I have been playing with a new one - it ends up needing a few work-arounds. So I figure if I understand it better, the workaround may start to make more sense and be cleaner :slightly_smiling_face:
U322K0W57 : <@U3G9W54HH> What are you talking about exactly? I dont really understand your question and what platforms are you talking about. You mention something about Java, but that has nothing to do with botkit. Can you be more specific?
U3G9W54HH : Maybe I am in the wrong spot! I wasn't referencing botkit - I am specifically referencing the Slack API
U3G9W54HH : Someone elsewhere linked me here - so figured I would ask in an effort to understand
U0Y7H2F3M : <@U3G9W54HH> <#C0K8617D5|slack-api> is the place :)
U3G9W54HH : thank you <@U0Y7H2F3M> - wasn't aware this was botkit specific in <#C04SM6TAK|general> - thank you!
U0Y7H2F3M : No in general we talk about everything. There is <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> channel as well! :smile: 
U3G9W54HH : Thanks :wink:
U3G9W54HH : I didn't look around first, my bad
U1DM2B4SY : <@U3DRLK1AP> - please refrain from testing bots in the general channel
U3EFK8UES : <@U0FSRDKHN> are there some sort of "rules" here? In regards to this bot posting in here
U0V93GE5R : its just general convention
U0V93GE5R : general is for human discussion, if you need a test channel its best to do it privately since everyone is auto-added to <#C04SM6TAK|general>
U3DRLK1AP : Apology by mistake my bot posted message on general channel.
U0Y7H2F3M : <@U3DRLK1AP> there are few channels here for testing bots. <#C0AQ7F5B6|testing_something>  <#C2R7BEJV8|testingbot> .Please use them. :slightly_smiling_face: :+1: 

U3DRLK1AP : <@U0Y7H2F3M> Thanks
U3ES7AM6X : Just wrote this post. I dont know that it will help alot of people here because so many of you are building way better bots. This is better suited for the startup that wants a support bot on their website. Hope it helps anyway. I just published “Deploy a website support chatbot with <http://API.ai|API.ai> &amp; <http://smooch.io|smooch.io> in the cloud for $5/m” <https://medium.com/dronzebot/deploy-a-website-support-chatbot-with-api-ai-smooch-io-in-the-cloud-for-5-m-7d39510380ca#.h0xditb2y>
U3GP1C613 : Hello everyone, I'm looking for information on how to interact with a user using python-slackclient (asking questions, getting answers and using them) can anyone help or refer to some docs that could help? thanks!
U3EFK8UES : I'm currently using the python apio
U3EFK8UES : *api
U3EFK8UES : So current I am using a testing token to be able to delete messages
U3EFK8UES : Anybody have any better suggestins
U3EFK8UES : *suggestions
U3EFK8UES : Without getting a doman with ssl
U3G9W54HH : <@U3EFK8UES> - I am not sure you need SSL for that part of using the api?  But that said, if you need SSL for testing your slack app - you could look into using `ngrok`: <https://ngrok.com/> . That is what I use
U3EFK8UES : I can't delete messages with a bot token
U3G9W54HH : Oh, with the bot token - sorry. Missed that part
U36JH8YTW : guys, a simple question, for subscribe a event for a bot app, I've the Request URL Configuration &amp; Verification part. How do I receive a msg? What url should I setup for receive the call from slack?
U272P5K71 : <@U36JH8YTW> it's up to you, I usually use `/events` on my server. What language/SDK are you using?
U36JH8YTW : I'm using Java
U36JH8YTW : I can't find the doc tell me how the actual response url I should setup <@U272P5K71>
U272P5K71 : <@U36JH8YTW> you'll need a publicly accessible endpoint for Slack to hit. That endpoint can be whatever you want it to be. Here's an example: <https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Ruby-Onboarding-Tutorial/blob/master/Section-3.md>
U36JH8YTW : <@U272P5K71> thanks
U36PZJHQQ : i'm trying to read the timestamp using `channels.history` but coming up with typerrors. anyone able to see if i'm doing something wrong here?
U36PZJHQQ : i'm using `response.messages[0].ts`
U36PZJHQQ : and its coming back `TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined`
U322K0W57 : <@U36PZJHQQ> Can you add some code snippets, seems like response.messages is undefined thus you cannot access response.messages[0]
U36PZJHQQ : right now just trying to get it to return in console, here's what i'm using
U36PZJHQQ : I'm confused because what i get back in the tester on <http://api.slack.com/methods/channel.history|api.slack.com/methods/channel.history> is different than what i get back when I run that
U322K0W57 : can you jsu try and do a console.log(response.messages) instead of the JSON stringify line
U322K0W57 : because i think its undefined
U322K0W57 : also do a console.log(response.messages[0]) and console.log(response.messages[0].ts)
U36PZJHQQ : yeah, `console.log(response.messages)` comes back `undefined`
U322K0W57 : so you need to solve that
U322K0W57 : can you do a console.log(response)
U322K0W57 : see if there is anything in there
U36PZJHQQ : yeah, that comes back
U322K0W57 : yeah, but can you add it here please
U322K0W57 : so we can see whats in there
U36PZJHQQ : yeah, let me pull out my tokens from it really quick
U322K0W57 : so as you can see
U322K0W57 : your messages are inthe body
U322K0W57 : of course
U322K0W57 : not in the response
U36PZJHQQ : ah
U322K0W57 : :wink:
U322K0W57 : so
U322K0W57 : oh
U322K0W57 : sorry
U322K0W57 : so do a console.log(response.body)
U322K0W57 : thats what you will have to turn into an object
U322K0W57 : with JSON.parse
U322K0W57 : and then access it
U322K0W57 : makes sense ? :slightly_smiling_face:
U36PZJHQQ : i think so!
U322K0W57 : your object is in response.body
U36PZJHQQ : the json i was expecting to come back is definitely coming back now.
U36PZJHQQ : but i guess i thought that `response.body.messages[0].ts` would do it
U36PZJHQQ : but i think im on the right track now at least :smiley:
U322K0W57 : no because you have it in text format
U322K0W57 : you need to do var myData = JSON.parse(response.body)
U322K0W57 : and then you can access stuff like: myData.messages[0].ts
U322K0W57 : :wink:
U36PZJHQQ : ah
U36PZJHQQ : okay
U36PZJHQQ : thanks <@U322K0W57> !!
U322K0W57 : no worries. of course JSON.parse will work only if you have a valid json object :slightly_smiling_face: but by the looks of it, it seems to be
U322K0W57 : let me know if it works
U36PZJHQQ : yep i think so now!
U36PZJHQQ : will do
U36PZJHQQ : that did it :smiley:
U36PZJHQQ : much appreciated!
U3C1KGJDD : <@U322K0W57>  I 'm using gif as well and noticed the thumbnail usually doesn't display, sometimes the Gif doesn't even load in Messenger (even &lt; 3mb). I 've asked Facebook and they are working on it right now, will let you know as soon as I get an answer. btw my Gif are hosted on Giphy
U322K0W57 : yeah, ive seen the same thing
U322K0W57 : i dont want to use giphy as they are very bad at organizing them and updating
U322K0W57 : its good when you are working with a 10-20 gifs
U322K0W57 : but when you are dealing with 400 :slightly_smiling_face:
U322K0W57 : keeping track of so many and updating any
U322K0W57 : would be impossible :slightly_smiling_face:
U322K0W57 : as im not using the API
U322K0W57 : but it would be nice to see Facebook fix their GIF issues :slightly_smiling_face:
U3C1KGJDD : Their developer is talking to my bot right trying to reproduce the issue, i ll let you know
U3C1KGJDD : Guys, did anyone manage to have typing on with convo in Messenger? It's like the issuehas been pending for 6 months. Anyone has a fix?
U322K0W57 : at the moment thats not implemented in Botkit
U322K0W57 : its not an issue
U322K0W57 : do you guys know if i need ot submit for approval the facebook app that contains the chatbot as well, on top of the submission for the chatbot review?
U322K0W57 : i really need help with this please
U322K0W57 : as its the first time im submitting a chatbot to facebook
U1DDKQPGB : <@U322K0W57> didn't realize you had to build an app too
U1DDKQPGB : you'll need to submit
U322K0W57 : well, the chatbot is actually a facebook app
U322K0W57 : that has some webhooks and some Messenger properties
U322K0W57 : but you dont need to get the app approved if you dont use special permission stuff
U3EFK8UES : Anybody aware of how to delete a message using a BOT users
U3EFK8UES : *user
U322K0W57 : if you only use the basic permissions you dont need any approval for that
U3EFK8UES : rather than creating an integration
U1DDKQPGB : <@U322K0W57> ask <@U3020AK8U>
U3FGRUSLT : up to 2 people in <#C3GGFEL49|command_line_slack> channel amazing!
U322K0W57 : <@U1DDKQPGB> I will be writing a medium article about the chatbot approval process, from the development stage to the users phone :wink:
U322K0W57 : the 5 stages of grief - will be the title
U322K0W57 : :)))
U1DDKQPGB : actually don't do that just yet <@U322K0W57> as i just connected you with the gods of FB Messenger and you'd rather be on their good side - so hold off for now :slightly_smiling_face:
U322K0W57 : oooh
U322K0W57 : no man
U322K0W57 : i was kidding
U322K0W57 : i would not complain in the article
U322K0W57 : we dont want to anger the gods :)))
U0YB2C09Y : <@U1DDKQPGB>: I agree with your sentiment, which is exactly why Im less than stoked about developing for facebook :pensive:
U0YB2C09Y : It seems several times per week, people join this slack team looking for a specific answer and post in general with a topic that would be better suited elsewhere, like <#C0DC1BM24|jobs>, <#C0J61PA31|botkit-basics>, <#C0K8617D5|slack-api>, or <#C0J3CL5V1|language-python>. Also to make clear the rules about using @ channel, bots posting to non-testing channels, etcTo help onboard people to this team, we should have a slackbot welcome people as soon as they join and direct them to some of the most commonly used channels for people looking for help.
As people who have likely come here under similar circumstances, what would y'all want to see in an onboarding message?
Would be a chance to reduce off topic postings, and give a lil taste of cutting edge bot design and best practives to devs coming in

U0YB2C09Y : Im imagining something similar to the example the slackapi folks put out<https://github.com/slackapi/onboarding-example>

U0YB2C09Y : <https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/35968/17162650/5703766c-537d-11e6-9c36-3e780d06f77c.gif>
U272P5K71 : While building these, we also discussed using them for a Code of Conduct type of thing.
Here's the updated Python version using Share instead of Star, because Star has some weird scope issues: <https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Python-Onboarding-Tutorial>

U272P5K71 : and Ruby, if that's anyone's strong suite: <https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Ruby-Onboarding-Tutorial>
U36PZJHQQ : any thoughts on why something would be working fine locally but give me a `TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined` when running on Heroku?
U36PZJHQQ : im just trying to get the `ts` of the latest message in a slack channel, the code is pretty simple
U0YB2C09Y : <@U36PZJHQQ>: Hmmm the same code works locally? Not sure, can you successfully log `time.messages` from heroku?
U3FGRUSLT : dhulser: look at the raw json, it's trying to do foo[0] on something that's not even an object
U3GQ14BRP : hi everyone :slightly_smiling_face:
U0GPKTHQ9 : Who else is feeling the holiday dip right now? Numbers down 50% across the board :no_mouth:
U3EBZKDDK : Hi! Does anyone knows if I can make a simple button without needing to go to an endpoint? I'm using python client
U3EFK8UES : <@U3EBZKDDK> pretty sure slack api requires a full on integration for buttons
U3EFK8UES : ```Posting messages with buttons requires registering a Slack app. Interactive messages cannot be posted using a custom integration. Create an app if you don't already have one.```
U3EFK8UES : Actually an app
U3EBZKDDK : Okay. I was just wondering if there's another way around it. hehe :stuck_out_tongue:
U3EBZKDDK : I've got a slack app setup already, and I did read that I need a request url. Just wondering if I could do so without that. Thanks!
U36JH8YTW : when we design a the event type base bot, is there a way to make a sequential conversion?
U3FGRUSLT : sure just call <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage> in the right order u want the conversation to flow rite?
U36JH8YTW : <@U3FGRUSLT> yes~
U36JH8YTW : is there a good way to tell the conversion finished? I know this is a silly question~:relieved:
U3FGRUSLT : unless the human types "/end" or something
U3FGRUSLT : it would have to be AI to know when the human is done


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
	If Yes:
	1.Bad	2.Very bad
	If No:
	1.Good	2.Very good


How confident are you?
	1.Low
	2.Average
	3.High

Optional!
can you highlight place/word/sentence which lead to your decision
