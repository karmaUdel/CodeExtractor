U0GC1C09L : just wondering if anyone here uses clojurewerkz/neocons on a semi regular basis?
U0GC1C09L : in case someone picks this up later, i find myself writing a lot of cypher queries and executing them via tquery, but i'm constantly mapping through results to pluck the :data values and ignore all the other stuff i don't care about (incoming relationships, meta properties, etc.). i'm now resorting to spectre to stay sane. is there a better way?
U3JURM9B6 : in a *.cljc file, I should be able to just do:
(:require [clojure.core.match :refer [match]])

and it all works right?

or do I have to #?(:cljs ... :clj) separate lines ?

U1C03090C : you probably need to escape the vector (`'[clojure.core.match :refer [match]]`)
U1C03090C : not sure beyond that
U3JURM9B6 : but it's insided the ns part
U3JURM9B6 : ```(ns ...
  (:require ... ))
```

why do i need quotes inside a ns ?

U1C03090C : right, you don't. Sorry about that
U3JURM9B6 : effort is apprecaited
U3JURM9B6 : this latest "some stuff is magical clj/cljs is confusing me"
U0J9LVB6G : <@U3JURM9B6> I think this should work.```
(ns foo.bar
  (:require
   [clojure.core.match :refer [match] #?@(:cljs [:include-macros true])]))
```

U0J9LVB6G : <https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Differences-from-Clojure#namespaces>
U0J9LVB6G : You may get away with not including the include-macros thingy, and just :requiring normally, but it depends on how the namespace you're requiring is written.

U1WMPA45U : hrm, there really is no way to override hashCode for a defrecord, huh?
U1WMPA45U : I've got an issue with that, I have a defrecord that contains a derived map from potemkin, but which one of the "keys" of the derived map is null
U1WMPA45U : which causes hashCode to throw a NullPointerException
U064X3EF3 : a null in a map shouldn't cause an NPE
U064X3EF3 : so I'd say that's a bug in potemkin, but would need to see more to know for sure
U11BV7MTK : <@U1WMPA45U> what defrecord stuff are you using? i'll look at it
