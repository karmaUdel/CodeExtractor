You may get away with not including the include-macros thingy, and just :requiring normally, but it depends on how the namespace you're requiring is written.

hrm, there really is no way to override hashCode for a defrecord, huh?
I've got an issue with that, I have a defrecord that contains a derived map from potemkin, but which one of the "keys" of the derived map is null
which causes hashCode to throw a NullPointerException
a null in a map shouldn't cause an NPE
so I'd say that's a bug in potemkin, but would need to see more to know for sure
<@U1WMPA45U> what defrecord stuff are you using? i'll look at it
