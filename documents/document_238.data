U4T0WR6EM : ```controller.storage.users.get(message.user, function(err, user) {
	console.log(user);
});
```

U52BRS8LW : where I implement that?
U4T0WR6EM : When your controller matches a pattern ( either in channel, dm, etc... )
U51QR4Z29 : Hey devs! I'm planning to write a serverless slack bot(aws lambda + api gateway + slack integration + events api). I'd like the bot to have private conversation with users. Is there a good tutorial someone here can point me to?
U51QR4Z29 : also is running a bot on lambda possible? (without slash commands)
U3F5HQUF4 : hey is did anybody worked with Slack Interactive messsages, i am unable to get Actions working for those messages
U51QR4Z29 : How do you get slack channel tokens? from UI
U0GT29N3A : <@U51QR4Z29> channel tokens? What do you mean? Tokens are for users (either human or bot)
U4U0J0P4P : Hello guys, my name is chris and i am trying to build  a bot that automates slack group invites... I know these exist but I  want to build it since am new to bot development... I used botkit(which is built with node.js) and i was able to  communicate with  a user and get an email...but i could not send an invite to that email. Please how do you guys handle this especially since the user invite method is not documented
U4BAQAQ1G : <@U4U0J0P4P> Contact Slack Support Team for you query
U4T0WR6EM : <@U52BRS8LW> I realized that the method I posted above dosen't work rather you need to do:
```
<http://bot.api.users.info|bot.api.users.info>({ user: message.user }, (err,response) =&gt; {
   console.log(response);
});
```

U51QR4Z29 : How do I integrate API gateway with a custom bot (with subscription to events)? I see only integration with slash command? Don't find any documentation on it. Could someone help me out?
U526NGNAW : my bot is not responding to any messages after following the setup guide. event subscription's verified and enabled, is there any way to debug what's wrong?
U04S3JCH2 : which setup guide?
U0V93GE5R : also where is your bot being hosted, also carefully verify all your web endpoint urls
U526NGNAW : slack integration guide from readme. actually i'm seeing replies now after _reinstalling_ app
U526NGNAW : where can i find docs on all the events botkit supports? like _direct_message_
U526NGNAW : and what URL would I use for a slashcommand integration?
U526NGNAW : i'm probably not finding the right place to get more documentation on botkit. help would be appreciated :smile:
U0V93GE5R : <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/readme-slack.md#slack-specific-events>
U0V93GE5R : <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/examples/slackbutton_slashcommand.js>
U526NGNAW : thank you! i am using local environment with ngrok
U04S3JCH2 : be sure to join and search the <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> channel too — tons of good info in there
U0V93GE5R : so your url is whatever the output is in ngrok
U0V93GE5R : <http://string.ngrok.com|string.ngrok.com> etc
U526NGNAW : ok, i'm guessing its just i'm using the starter kit and slash command is not set up
U0V93GE5R : the starter kit is jsut botkit with some events specific docs
U0V93GE5R : it supports the full range of slack integrations
U0V93GE5R : its just that slash commands is kind of a legacy integration, so the examples are a bit long in the tooth
U0V93GE5R : we are working on refactoring the docs to be more inline with the realities of slack as it is today, but its tricky
U527FL0KE : <@U0V93GE5R> when you say "as it is today" is that just the events API?
U0V93GE5R : my opinion is that everyone should be making bots with the events api, for a number of reasons, but as long as other integrations are available, botkit will support them
U0V93GE5R : but I think we could stand to improve how they are documented.
U04SM6T2H : it is possible to add slash commands to the starter kit though!
U04SM6T2H : you can handle it with
U04SM6T2H : controller.on(‘slash_command', function(bot, payload) { … });
U04SM6T2H : and the webhook url is _yoururl.com_/slack/receive
U51QR4Z29 : <@U04SM6T2H> : I'm running into the same issue, request URL verfied, but chat bot doesn't seem to pop
U0V93GE5R : using the starter kit? self hosted?
U51QR4Z29 : hosting it on aws lambda
U51QR4Z29 : Any suggestions?
U0V93GE5R : i dont have any direct experience with lamba sorry, but ill add it to my todo list
U0V93GE5R : there are a few issues on the github and have been some threads on this slack about it though, you should try a search!
U52Q3MTRQ : hey ya'll -  has anyone successfully built a bot to handle a lot of income customers upport requets (tier 1)?   i've got a project and i'm looking for a talenetd dev to partner on
U0KNN1SBV : Hi bot builders/ Slack :heart: -  <http://Duuoo.io|Duuoo.io> is town (SF) any builders out there there is up for meeting to share learnings? (we are from the same studio as <https://walkiebot.co>)
U4N4L46UT : Hi all - I am building a slack bot and want to spend the least amount of time worrying about deployment &amp; scaling. I want it to be available in the slack directory so that anyone can install it. I am OK with an interim solution for &lt;50 users and I am also OK spending $ here. Is something like botkit + beep boop the best route to take (a la <https://chatbotsmagazine.com/creating-a-simple-slack-bot-with-botkit-js-and-hosting-it-for-free-with-beepboop-2f5937bdb376>)?
U53SAGHK9 : I just made a new app and only subscribed to `<http://message.im|message.im>` events, but I'm getting other message-related events as well; is that expected behavior?
U52DH19GQ : Just posted this problem on stackoverflow
U52DH19GQ : <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43564535/menu-shown-instead-of-button-on-android>
U52DH19GQ : anyone seen it before?
U52DH19GQ : only seems to be a problem on Android slack app
U53A1N5HB : I'm just getting started with botkit for Facebook. And the starter guide in the welcome bot links to a 404 page. Any good resources or connections for up and running with botkit? I'm hitting a couple bumps with webhooks, verify tokens, and what URL to point the webhook when using Heroku. 
U0V93GE5R : where are you seeing a 404? links seem to work for me here <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-facebook>
U0V93GE5R : your urls will be something like <https://yourappname.herokuapp.com/facebook/receive>
U0V93GE5R : You can also ask more questions in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> or <#C4MJKM145|botkit_studio>

U37C5V3HT : A very old question how to use `bot.replyWithTyping` with timeout as whenever i use this, the typing indicator stays for a longer period of time before sending another reply.
U0JAVM98A : Do you have these sorts of issue right now when calling the rest API?&gt;&gt;&gt; *err*=Error: socket hang up
*api*=channels.leave

U53A1N5HB : When this says open source, it doesn't delineate whether it can be uploaded as a web app specifically open. Do you have more info on it?
U07CW6N3A : acemtp: Slack is reporting some connectivity issues right now: <https://status.slack.com/>  which would likely effect usage of the web API.

U0D7F12ER : UX question: Does anyone know how/why the UX convention for buttons in Slack have evolved such that app developers are putting the primary action on the left, not the right? This is compared to Apple and Google UX guidelines, which both put "continue"/default actions on the right, with stopping/canceling actions on the left.
Compare Slack apps: <https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/message-buttons-and-the-slack-api-ab938174af70>

to Apple dialogs: <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/WindowDialogs.html>

U53SKBJNS : does any know why in mac the speach to text service generates the next message “could not detect endianness after looking at the tail 0 non-zero byte string in a data stream of 366792 bytes. Is the bytestream really PCM data?”
U0554MQJB : superstrong: that's what slack is doing in their OAuth flow as well, maybe people are just copying their button placement?
U0554MQJB : They do the opposite in some cases: <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/article_attachments/209368387/request.png>
U0GT29N3A : <@U0554MQJB> Not a UX guy myself, but in all the cases shown, the primary action is on the same side the buttons are aligned.When buttons are on the left, the main action is on the left and vice-versa.
Either way, what works best in my opinion is when the primary action has more weight (different color).

U37C5V3HT : Hi everyone! another question for botkit sending a random message. But the problem I'm having with the keywords such as `thanks`, `thank you`, `thanks a lot` etc.. in this case, the bot doesn't listen or ignoring such keywords especially `thanks` … but it's running fine the moment i change its keywords.. *what could be the problem?*
U37C5V3HT : <@U04SM6T2H> do you know why it's causing the problem :thinking_face:
U4AC2FLR0 : Does this do what you want? ```// Replies to keywords such as thanks, thx, thank you, etc module.exports = function(controller) {
controller.hears(['^Thanks','^thx','^thank u','^thank you','^thanks a lot','^thank you so much'], ['direct_message', 'direct_mention', 'mention'], function(bot, message) {
    var message_options = [
    	  "You got it",
    	  "Don't mention it",
        "Not a problem",
        "No worries",
        "My pleasure",
        "I'm happy to help",
    	  "Anytime"
	]
	var random_index = Math.floor(Math.random() * message_options.length)
	var chosen_message = message_options[random_index]

  bot.reply(message, chosen_message)
    // do something here, the "is typing" animation is visible

});
}```

U4AC2FLR0 : It's replying to my bot and it ignores sentences like, "hey thank you?" but triggers only on the keyword
U37C5V3HT : ah! i see.. Thanks! do you know can i add two keywords in this case like `Thank you` :thinking_face:
U37C5V3HT : I've added this on botkit/github <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/801>
U4AC2FLR0 : add two more keywords?
U37C5V3HT : just asking, currently i have used 1 keyword (thanks), 2 (thank you), and 3 (thanks a lot). so just wondering what's causing this…
U54V8P5QD : hey folks...is anyone using the `rtm.connect` method rather than `rtm.start` ?
U54V8P5QD : I recently switched to using `rtm.connect` once my company switched to enterprise grid... we have so many users that `rtm.start` is no longer a viable option
U54V8P5QD : my problem is...my bot no longer shows as online
U54V8P5QD : anyone else experience that?
