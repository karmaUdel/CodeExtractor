Hi!  I am writing a Json.Encode function to create an object in the back end, in my database.  I have a Kase. ```type alias kase =  { name : String, organization : Maybe Organization.Model, ...} ```. The field organization is a Maybe.  If there is no organization entered, I don't want that field passed in my Json object.  as it will give me some validation errors. How can I do that?  I can only think of doing List.append. This is how the code looks like if an organization exists
