U0XRM115M : our support team uses it to capture a slack convo and generate a zendesk support ticket
U0XRM115M : so they don't have to summarize
U0XRM115M : anyhoot, I grab the user id from the outgoing webhook payload
U0XRM115M : and use it when ready to notify the user of the ticket creation
U2DNFG26B : nice, I should be able to reply in private then. My use case looks like yours a lot. Currently, we enter a command in a private channel like ".find test" where test can be anything. Then, we search in or update a google sheet. Then the result or the confirmation is printed in the same channel that the command was entered. That's working really well but the thing is, we are only 6 people so It's fine for now. Soon everyone will be able to input those commands, so the channel will be a mess. So my perfect idea would be to have a private conversation directly with the bot, then I will execute my command, and return the output. All in DM.
U2DNFG26B : I hope to find a solution soon!
U0XRM115M : gl!
U2DNFG26B : <@U0XRM115M> did you use the #id or @id or only id as the channel ?
U0XRM115M : let me pull up my file
U0XRM115M : only id, I grab it from the outgoing webhook payload like this ```$slackuserid = $_POST['user_id'];```
U0XRM115M : and when I create the payload for the incoming: ```$payload = array(   		"channel" =&gt; "$slackuserid",
   		"username" =&gt; "Support Ticket",
   		"text" =&gt; "Ticket created: $linktoticket",
   		"icon_emoji" =&gt; ":iceking_cart:"
	);```

U0XRM115M : so no # or @
U0XRM115M : <@U2DNFG26B> ^ sorry forgot to tag you in the answer
U2DNFG26B : thank you. For a reason unknown if my user id is in a variable, it doesn't work, but if I input the user id value myself in channel, it's working. The only thing is, I get the response the Dm with slackbot. is this what's you also have ?
U2DSW08UU : Is it possible to mute a specific user in a channel?
U2EHWA8NM : hello guys, I have a question. I integrated our web api with the slack team channel and I am sending messages with buttons. I want that button to lead me to external url when I click it? Is that possible, I tried a lot of options but there are not working
U2EHWA8NM : thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
U0KECURAT : <@U2EHWA8NM> that's not supported (yet)
U0HBN0L9M : need to fall back to links in text/fields

U2ENG30R5 : Please advise
U1DM2B4SY : wouldn't you want to use content.url_private instead of file.url_private? where do you define file?
U1DM2B4SY : also, might get a better response in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit>
U2ENG30R5 : i have tried content.url_private too. i got a output as undefined
U2ENG30R5 : for your referecne i have attached the code snippet
U1DM2B4SY : try content.file.url_private ? Maybe the content is the entire event which also has a 'type' field
U2ENG30R5 : let try now
U2ENG30R5 : TypeError: Cannot read property 'url_private' of undefined
U1DM2B4SY : so content.file doesn't exist....I wonder what the heck content is then haha
U1DM2B4SY : <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> would have a better answer for you I wager, rather than the general channel
U2ENG30R5 : sure i will post this question into <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> . thanks for your help have a wonderful day
U2EQ6LJDA : hello all~
U2F5Q8UG6 : Looking for help with my use case - I already have Twilio integration setup and want to use BotKit for the conversation functionality only. In other words I don't need to connect and listen to Twilio. Is there a way I can do this, maybe using Botkit.core directly ?
U04SM6T2H : <@U2F5Q8UG6> there is actually
U04SM6T2H : you can route messages in and out however you want by building your own connector
U04SM6T2H : DM me if you want more detalis
U04SM6T2H : it is not well documented _yet_
U200UBJSJ : Howdy all.. any good resources on the Events API? Couldn't find the right channel.. sorry.
U04SM6T2H : <@U200UBJSJ> the <#C1XFTGV55|slapp> framework supports events
U200UBJSJ : I'll check it out. I've been crafting my own from the ground up. Nice to know.
U04SM6T2H : botkit will eventually too
U04SM6T2H : what kind of resources do you need?
U04SM6T2H : (sorry going afk)
U200UBJSJ : Thanks. Botkit is wonderful. Wrote my own RTM handlers and conversation flows, before I found the gem that is Botkit.
U200UBJSJ : Looking into the Events API as a way to keep resources low. Possibly re-engineer what we've built to support scale.
U200UBJSJ : Just had a peek at slapp .. nice work. Looks like you need to roll your own state management, or plug into the BeepBoop ecosystem. Worth a look.
U2EDT25NJ : Hi everyone!  Excited to be in here :slightly_smiling_face:  
Does someone know of a bot that does Do not disturb (DND) on steroids?  We have certain channels with customers in it and would like to send them a bot message if it is outside our office hours.  Ideas?    

Thanks!

U2FAXVB6V : Hey everyone! Thanks for letting me join.  Quick questions: What is the best practice in terms of handling multiple slack groups and their data/privacy? Also how do you approach modeling the database?
U0HBN0L9M : <@U2EDT25NJ> check toki by <@U15SL8QHG>
U0HBN0L9M : <https://github.com/kevinsuh/toki>
U0HBN0L9M : not exactly what you're looking for, but could inspire you
U2EDT25NJ : <@U0HBN0L9M> thank you very much,  checking it out!
U15SL8QHG : That's an interesting problem you have <@U2EDT25NJ>. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions / thoughts / ideas
U2EDT25NJ : awesome, very much appreciate it.  As we all know slack is amazing, but when customers are in there… kills down time after hours.
U2EDT25NJ : will DM you next week after I have a chance to check it out <@U15SL8QHG> :slightly_smiling_face:
U15SL8QHG : Sounds great! Looking forward to it
U2F5Q8UG6 : Can botkit be used with Twilio SMS ?
U2F5Q8UG6 : I see it works with TwilioIP but my understanding is IP can not send SMS / MMS messages to phone numbers
U04SM6T2H : there is a botkit-sms plugni yes
U04SM6T2H : <https://www.npmjs.com/package/botkit-sms>
U2F5Q8UG6 : Nice, thanks <@U04SM6T2H> !
