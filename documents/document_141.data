RESPONSE: <http://lmgtfy.com/?q=&lt;stupid> question&gt;```
How do you format like that?
triple ` ticks before and after
single \` ticks allow you to `hightlight inline`
I really like the idea of using interactions on messages from integrations to sync to third parties… that's super powerful
Thoughts on whether orgs would feel a bit squeamish about sending every message to a random 3rd party? Do you think these RTM integrations would work better as custom bots that ran on their own servers?
<@U04SS2NBF> seems like the logical endpoint of that becomes things like Evernote's  Context system, where related content is automatically associated with what you're doing.
A lot of the value would come from behind-the-firewall integrations for us, I'd imagine
Like if you mentioned a JIRA ticket, have it automatically link to the JIRA server
Yeah, makes sense.
But I feel like right now that's just a question because the 'Slack for Enterprise' doesn't exist yet
like, when we got Github Enterprise, it totally changed the types of integrations we were willing to do.
I'd love to see an integration that acted as a before_filter on messages that match a certain pattern… so they could dynamically link things like JIRA tickets, etc.
It might not even be an integration, more of a core feature like highlights.
And <@U04SM6T2H>, "what is our vacation policy? —&gt; here's a link” can already be handled by slackbot's custom responses, right? Is there an API for reading/writing those custom responses?
Welcome to the channel, <@U04T87ZQH>
:hamburger:
Hey <@U04T87ZQH>!
hey!
<@U04SM6T2H>: looks like your draft bot is working fine
<@U04T87ZQH>: good luck with the <#C04SM6TAK> backlog, and it's only day 2
I swear I won't be mining this or spying on everyone, but some of the good ideas from here I might retweet as SlackAPI on Twitter
(and I'll ask first)
One thing you can't do from the RTM (or other) API is issue a slash command.
Welcome to the channel, <@U04SM6K6N>
Welcome to the channel, <@U04SMATQW>
hey guys!!
<@U04SS2NBF> -&gt; the existing slackbot responses COULD be used for that kind of thing,b ut you would have to set up responses for each keyword. Whereas a bot that just looks for people asking questions, and attempts to match the question to an answer in a database full of answers is a totally different beast.
<https://twitter.com/stewart/status/599283187760541696>
Sweet!
I was going to do Slack consulting, but now that the market's crowded, the pressure's off.
I think we can all do slack consulting
<@U04SM6T2H>: there goes your summer
If Slack continues to grow like it has
There will be a whole coalition of us
but then you'll just “buy out” all the Slack consultants, Bill-Gates-in-The-Simpsons-style.
I mean, yah, I hope so!
If I am ever in a position to roll up other companies
I will! :simple_smile:
I can see the re-branding now: XOXCOs.
lol
Welcome to the channel, <@U04TA4XBM>
yo yo <@U04TA4XBM>
<@U04T87ZQH>, here's your first dev4slack OH: "I think we can all do slack consulting"
<@U04S4763Y>: heyyoo!
It's 4:45 here in Texas so we are actually LATE for :beers:
<@U04SJBP5Q> CHEERS MATE
I hear ya.
It's crazy
for every one of these free github slack plugins I see
… there's a “company” launching something too
<https://github.com/jonathanwiesel/slackus>
cool! monitor comments in slack
<http://launchkit.io/reviews|launchkit.io/reviews>
Monitor app store reviews in slack (company)
Latest beta of slack in test flight has a dramatically faster apple watch app
Man, getting instantly notified of every review and comment seems like a tiny version of hell.  “Yes, Internet, I would like all the stupidity vomited up by my readers and users sluiced right into my workspace. All the time. Can I get them on my phone, too? Awesome!"
I'm working on slack-punchinthekidneys, where — every once in a while — Slackbot will punch you in the kidneys.  You know it's working because you pee blood.
Ha, totally. I have a solo-slack with a different channel for every integration imaginable just to see what it feels like. Are there any integrations yet that process a channel's contents and just share a time series about number of messages per hour/day and maybe some linguistic analysis of text and link contents. Only interesting to analytics freaks like me?
<@U04SS2NBF>: you and your time series
:chart_with_upwards_trend: :chart_with_downwards_trend: :collision:
... :poop:
I'll file that one away in "they just don't *get* ya, man". 
Welcome to the channel, <@U04T13DLQ>
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/books/review/rise-of-the-robots-and-shadow-work.html?ref=review&amp;_r=0>
The bots we program will eventually replace us
&gt; But, as Martin Ford documents in “Rise of the Robots,” the job-eating maw of technology now threatens even the nimblest and most expensively educated. Lawyers, radiologists and software designers, among others, have seen their work evaporate to India or China.
<http://mlkshk.com/p/149AO>
Thats us ^^
So much of this:
<http://www.producthunt.com/posts/product-slack>
I really don't think Slack should become your new email inbox
That just seems greatly annoying.
Yeah, I think it's probably the easiest type of integration to think of.
yeah
I don't have a well-formed opinion on it yet, but it seems like higher-quality integrations shouldn't just be redirects of email, but be proactive (via slash command  or other in-Slack interaction)
Agreed.
For something like Product Hunt, it would be kinda interesting to have a command to see trending products ...
like, to spark conversation about it on your team
“Let's see what's hot on Phunt today!” /phunt
something like /tophunts that returns the current top hunts
jinx
yeah
heh
or even "/producthunt twitter” to get top hunts for that query
This weekend I was imagining a “slash commands for everythign” service
like, how hard would it be to tie a DOM parser to a slash command thing
given THIS QUERY, pass it to THIS URL and then give me THIS BIT from the resulting page
but why i guess
how hard is it to just search google? heh
The positive part of “Email list to slack integrations” at least
is that it is 100% in your control to unsubscribe for real
ha! true.
and there's 0% likeliness that your email could be sold / traded, ‘cause that doesn't apply as well.
if only we could invalidate the token used to deliver email to our inboxes
So, I'm with you that this is not exactly the best integration one could ask for, but it is at least good in a non-user-hostile manner
<@U04SM6T2H>: as much as I'd love that, that seems like a hard sell for someone
<@U04S09GLN>: yeah
I just want to receive and reply to very specific emails via Slack, and then I will never have to check gmail ever again.
“First, auth your email against our OAUTH mail spam integration server, so you can have fine-grained control over delivery. Then, wait for all of your favorite GAP retailer brands to build an integration into our server. Then, you'll receive stuff, but have control over it!"
I like thigns like Kimono <https://www.kimonolabs.com/>
That, with like a point and click interface
turn any web page into a structured data feed
so
<@U04S3JCH2>: there are a few “forward this email to slack” services
that's why I was thinking about it
<@U04S09GLN>: yeah I started to build my own last Friday, mostly because I want a personable bot to interact with.
ha
Are there any counfluence slack integratioins yet?
<https://www.cloudpipes.com/>
that looks potentially cool
is that yahoo pipes as a service but not owned by yahoo?
PS how come someone hasn't built the physical version of this yet?
I want an actual set of blocks on my desk that defines integrations and data flow.
heh
Kinda like littlebits?
That look like real pipes!
IFTTT x Lincoln Logs
<@U04S6E9EW>: kind-of, except those are still technical.
More like… that sequencer that used a matrix of rubix cubes?
<@U04S09GLN>: cool until the cleaning lady knocks your legos down and takes the entire network offline
(I'm bitter because my lego ATAT fell off my bookshelf and exploded into a million pieces this morning)
<http://createdigitalmusic.com/2015/03/watch-16-rubiks-cubes-turn-visual-music-sequencer/>
That's what I was thinking of.
So that, but not rubix cubes
that defines data integrations etc
oh wow
<@U04SM6T2H>: serves you right for not having a full-scale Hoth for the ATAT to live on.
<@U04S09GLN>: I am kicking myself
the rebels too easily integrated my bookshelf
Meanwhile, I have my Mars Rover lego set that has been sitting next to my Falling Water lego set forever. “Please assemble me!” they taunt from the high shelf.
Welcome to the channel, <@U04U7PL2B>
¡gracias!
<@U04SM6T2H>: Not sure if this is of interest, but I'm on a couple of Slack teams that have #invite channels where people who are just joining can scroll through &amp; get acclimated w/ the other members of the team?
we call that #intros in one of mine. basically you just say “hi i'm X, i do Y etc.” when you join
Shit.
That's what I meant.
#doi
created <#C04U80BHT>
what's the different between <#C04U80BHT> and your profile?
<#C04U80BHT> might be more detailed info: specific things you work on and whatnot
also puts it directly in the channel which means people can converse directly
ahh, i see
thats a good idea!
and then <@U04SJBP5Q> could suggest that to people too :simple_smile:
nice!
Welcome to the channel, <@U04TLHGSC>. Introduce yourself in the <#intros> channel!
I love this channel!
hey david!
Hi <@U04SM6T2H>
Hello hello <@U04TLHGSC>!
<@U04TLHGSC>: are you guys doing any cool stuff with slack at 29th street?
Please say yes, and then we need to form the NYC Publishers Slack group.
<@U04SM6T2H>: <@U04S09GLN> yes - we have some cool ideas!
We have an API now (this is not launched yet!!) <https://api.29.io/>
<@U04TLHGSC>: oh shit
:open_mouth:
Are you thinking this is public for end-users, or public for internal dev?
I'm assuming the former
We're figuring out how to bring it to the world.
It's also going to be our enterprise option. It used to be "We'll build you an app"
Now it's "you can build your own app"
But our core audience will be other developers
awesome
cool stuff, David!
If you have time to come by the office, we'll set up a demo for you
and <@U04S3JCH2> <@U04SM6T2H> we'll do a remote one
When is there going to be a slack-&gt;flipboard integration
so that every day a magazine is generated from one's internal traffic
<@U04TLHGSC>: I'd be into that, and I'm sure I could convince a few people to tag along. We've done a similar thing at WaPo's office in nyc
Yes, that's the dream
great, just let me know when
Also: <https://twitter.com/everyplace/status/599058367441739779>
strongly agree
that's why Lark is so much better
than the built in stuff
I'm pissed about the 15th
nobody is motivated by “Fill this chart"
I started my workout at 11:35pm and worked out for an hour
and it _didn't_ give me my full workout for the 15th, ‘cause I didn't hit 30 minutes until the next day :confused:
Yeah, you've got to hit that button.
I was saying the other day, if I eat a spicy curry and get in a cab, that's imperceptible from biking up Broadway
HA
<@U04SM6T2H>: I'm motivated, partially because the last week in these screenshots is my wedding
Gotta fit in that suit, you know?
Today, Ben got a verbal high-five from Lark re: activity when he was getting his FOURTH serving from the indian lunch buffet
"Way to be active, Ben!"
It knows me well!
being able to trick our gadgets is going to come in super handy once they are our masters
What I want is the bot that is the anti-lark
“You lookin' good today boy, eat another cheese burger."
“You've been standing up too much today. Why don't you take a nap?"
that's what we're here for
“Don't tire yourself out! There's lots of sleeping to do later and you want to be sure youre nice and rested."
Sounds like a similar voice to commandshift3's “You're very judgemental. Keep clicking!"
Last weekend I built a hubot-slack bot and one using the code <@U04SM6T2H> posted. The latter was way easier, of course, but the former might scale better after a while. Do you all have thoughts on the best way to get a RTM-powered bot up and running vs a slash command/webhooks bot? Should all integrations basically be understood as bots of different flavors?
I am biased against hubot because the process of building plugins is a bit complex
or at least teh documentation for it is
<https://hubot.github.com/docs/scripting/>
what I lean towards is a plugin-based system that lets you build out the behavior using vanilla javascript, and a core bot “runner” that handles the connection
similar to hubot, but achievable with dramatically less code
yup, I wish I built my RTM bot using a Superscript plugin
but if I built it as a Superscript plugin first, would I have wished I built it using RTM?
superscript looks amazing but also overkill for most things imho
<https://slack.com/varietypack>
awesome!
<@U04S6E9EW>: listened on my way in this morning. such a great quirky collection of stories! very slack.
fwiw hubot looks was pretty easy to build adhoc scripts for. you only need to build plugins if you want to distribute. but, yeah.
(?°?°??? ?d???s????o?
I've done what I can with <https://github.com/sillygwailo/Slack-Twitter> (now changed so it uses two channels instead of one to work around a heisenbug) so I'm moving on to other bot ideas
<@U04S4763Y>: nice!
pretty coooool
<@U04S4763Y>: any reason you didn't make it so that you posted by @messaging the bot?
no reason. I could add that. 
heh
that way people could chat about what they're gonna post
then post when ready
channel mostly so you could have transparency over who posted the tweet. 
all in one channel
I thought maybe it could append the initials of the person who tweeted it to the tweet. like what Barack Obama used to do
nice to have as an option
a slash command would be interesting, too
that's probably how I'd implement replies and RTs
the way the Slack iOS app handles tweet URLs means I can hand those parts off to a real Twitter client. 
yeah
but again, snice you have it using the real bot integration
why not just do it as @twitter_bot retweet
instead of /retweet
one integration instead of multiple
and cooler! :simple_smile:
I'll add that to the feature request list
heh
it already does starring as faving
awesome
I should make a bot that sends someone a DM I star their message in Slack
I'll name it slack-dopamine
hehe
if there was an way to sync Tweetbot mute filters outside of Tweetbot, I'd integrate with that cloud service.
god I wish I could sync mute filters
I have a super super nice friend
who happens to be super into QUILTS
and sometimes she goes on a QILT TWEETING RAMPAGE
omg
would you believe that's the reason I built Slack-Twitter?
so I could tweet on a topic (sports) from a unique "app" that people could mute 
there's no 3rd party Twitter client that lets you plug in <http://apps.twitter.com|apps.twitter.com> tokens
so I made one
necessity is the mother of invention
I'm the only person in the world that uses the "sillygwailo's Sports Tweets" 'app'
but yeah, on Twitter, everybody's an uncle. <http://www.quora.com/Is-Twitters-mainstream-potential-limited-because-its-feed-is-chronological/answer/Mills-Baker>
sillygwailo can i post gifs to twitter with your bot?
<@U04SR77Q1> No, just text. No reason it can't go on the feature requests list, though.
then i could have an auto tweeting gifstream slack room!
actually, what might be neat is -- and i don't know if this is possible -- but twitter cards. you could post the tweets in twitter cards and have some branding at the bottom that said "posted by a bot built by sillygwalio"
either way, i'm looking forward to playing with this
&gt;an auto tweeting gifstream slack room!
yeah
what I'm hearing is I should implement a plugin architecture for my bot
(I do actually want that, since it checks whether a message is 140 characters using Twitter's own algorithm, but lazily as a function)
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-text>
"getTweetLength returns the computed length of a tweet after taking into consideration <http://t.co|t.co> URL shortening and non UTF-16 characters” useful!
fail
Welcome to the channel, <@U04UV5TEM>. Introduce yourself in the <#intros> channel!
hey hey!
hi
I am putting together a big list of apps and bots and stuff that plugin to slack
any faves?
<http://www.producthunt.com/#!/s/collections/slack>
already got those lists
If anyone has any favorites (or anything they've built) that are NOT on that list at Product Hunt, let me know!!
super super rough!
ooh, neat! how many do you have so far?
there's also this: <https://api.slack.com/community>
i'd love to take a stab at categorizing them (by implementation or purpose or ???)
we need to do a better job with that. a long list like that is not super helpful.
it's a start! would be cool to sort it by popularity, though. :simple_smile:
oh right, I have to account for emoji in my Slack-Twitter client. posts the code to Twitter, but when viewing my timeline in Slack, it shows the emoji
Hey Guys, Would any of you like to test drive @happyfoxchat for their live chat needs? Looking for 2-4 small biz volunteers who can try it out and give feedback.
<@U04SS2NBF> totes
<@U04S1QCPC> yes planning several ways to slice and dice the list 
Hosted / self hosted 
Bots slash commands integrations
I want to cast a pretty wide net but not replicate the dev tool list 
<@U04SM6T2H> et al: <http://slackhq.com/post/117724460915/a-beginners-guide-to-your-first-bot>

Yeah, great post, <@U04SM6K6N>! I referenced it a couple weeks ago when I was playing around with integrations. 
:bow:
Welcome to the channel, <@U04V7RDHS>. Introduce yourself in the <#intros> channel!
Hey guys -- I'm Jon from over here in England :simple_smile: :gb:
Cheers, Jon!
I'm finishing up this essay about our Slack-connected wiki tool
<https://medium.com/@benbrown/e4f6d23a3495>
I'd love your thoughts!
here's the published version.
<https://medium.com/why-not/our-slack-wiki-e4f6d23a3495>
<@U04S4763Y>: thanks for the recommend :wink:
my pleasure!
I will peruse the docs and try it out, but does anyone know if outgoing webhooks can be sent from attachment comments?
<@U04UV5TEM> how do you mean?
Oh like if someone leaves a comment on a file
Yes. Exactly
I don't think so! but <@U04S1QCPC> might know
I was thinking about a situation where I might want to send the file off for some processing and the easiest way to do that
yeah that seems to be a really common need
Sending off a text file to be posted to an API or something.
You could include the link, but it's kind of obscure
yeah
you can use the RTM api
and trigger it based on a Star
oh yeah!
starring
I'd wager the RTM api also reports comments on files
it seems to report everything else
but definintely starred items
I'll dig into that (hopefully) this weekend. Thanks
I think that is something other people would be really interested to hear abut
so if you can.. share what you learn!
Of course
<@U04SM6T2H>: I need this wiki!
<@U04SS2NBF>! :simple_smile:
I'm working on ways to make it available
I'm trying to gauge interest before I sink too much time into it
as you know
fear of being crushed by tech debt
or FOBCBTD
heh
.com
i get it.
I really just wish there was a third party service
that would handle things like
provisioning and billing
so I could just be like
here's the *thing I built*
if you want it, *go register over there*
and my thing gets a webhook or something, configures itself, and is now available
but I don't have to build *yet another account management tool*
totally. can you build that next?
heh
everything just becomes an oauth
anyways
baby steps.
thanks for the recommend buster
I'm interested in the wiki, maybe I'll port over my Google Sites site (though I still love Google Sites, hmm)
I'll keep yall posted.
i'll probably get a hosted version up somehow that you can tie into
<@U04UV5TEM> RTM API w/ a bot user is probably the best route for this today
cool thanks <@U04S1QCPC>
not something we're working on soon, but i want us to get to the point where you can have webhooks for all of the different event types: <https://api.slack.com/events>
so that you don't have to manage a websocket and throw out all of the other stuff if you only care about certain things
:thumbsup: :thumbsup: :thumbsup:
That would also make more squeamish orgs feel safer if they knew that you were only getting a subset of all events.
RE the wiki: I'm also curious about the future integration of <http://spaces.pm|spaces.pm>. I'm guessing the primary use case you talked about in the post might be covered by that when it launches.
I think this is exactly what I want: <https://api.slack.com/events/file_comment_added>
<@U04SS2NBF>: probably? That's another reason why I'm a bit hesitant to pour effort into it
ugh it would be kind of cool to build a DM-only client that looks like a traditional IM client and masks the fact that your friends are now split across 12 different slack domains
Anyone know of a customer support tool that feeds requests into slack and lets the team respond to them from within slack?
<https://twitter.com/dwlz/status/601823634957553664>
<http://intercom.io|intercom.io>
they have a slack intergration and i think you can respond to people from there
cool yeah
i've heard good things about them
whoops, take that back -- it's only notifications <http://docs.intercom.io/Integrations/slack-integration>
ah
too bad
same with respondly
and front app
i wonder why
too many steps
heh
it's only a matter of time, probably
thats what I said on twitter
jinx
there've been a few things like this built: <https://chatlio.com>.
i wouldn't say that anyone's done it really well yet though.
that's pretty cool though
yeah
is anyone else looking forward to coding slack bots this 3 day weekend? because i certainly am
haha totally
i sometimes wish we published a “requests for integrations” page or something that listed all the random ideas we have for cool stuff that could be built with the slack api.
i might build something this weekend but am totally blanking on all of those ideas we've had :disappointed:
if I wasn't traveling this weekend, I'd definitely try write a bot that integrates with my not-a-Slack-bot app that picks a random Goodreads book from your shelves
just don't make something that inserts gif files
i think we have enough of those
who
try this
<https://twitter.com/search?q=%22wish%20slack%20had%22&amp;src=typd>
meh, nothing great in that list :simple_smile:
this one's a bit better: <https://twitter.com/search?q=%22wish%20%40slackhq%20had%22&amp;src=typd>
w/r/t Reddit-style karama, i kind of do wish there was a slackbot that would give out imaginary internet points
in my company, it would be a cool way to reward devs
lol
imaginary internet points is a good one though
like what if it was cross team?
omg
and had a leaderboard
maybe a leaderboard, but then it would get too competetive
<@U04SM6T2H> is winning the internet today with 150 points from his peers
YES COMPETITIVE!
heh
then people build bots to award themselves points
to cheat
"must.... post... cat... gif... for... more... points..."
i would go for a leaderboard, as long as you also were able to generate any amount of internet currency that you wanted, and it would wipe out at the end of the day
in our company slack we have a like… crafting/inventory system
haha
so like /create a thing
then /drop thing
and /take thing
I dunno why!
i just missed it from playing zork too much
*/kill troll with sword*
can you combine items to make new things?
heh no
not really CRAFTING in that sense ok you got me
hmm... because if you could, it would be kind of addicitve
people would do good work just to get the raw materials to build new items
too bad <http://worldofworkcraft.com|worldofworkcraft.com> is not available
haha
it could *be work*
*/combine github with deploybott
You got a staging environment
*/cast scale-up _on_ production
yesss
We should have a weekend integration challenge. 
Except I probably won't have any time to build stuff this weekend 
¯\_(?)_/¯
<https://github.com/meenie/console-bot>
whoa, that works in the *js console* in the browser
that is cool
I thought it was a terminal client
Morning everyone! Did anyone build anything awesome this weekend?
I read a bunch of really interesting articles about robots and AI
Morning, <@U04SM6T2H>.  What did you read?
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/science/darpa-robotics-challenge-terminator.html?ref=technology&amp;_r=0>
^^ We are pretty far ways off from having robots that can walk around like people
<http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-counselor>
<https://medium.com/@tanayj/self-driving-cars-and-the-trolley-problem-5363b86cb82d>
^^ BUT, that doesn't mean we won't have complex ethical questions to answer.  Self-driving cars are robots.
I spent a bunch of time wrestling with the question of
“What is a BOT?"
like, the kind of bot we talk about re: slack
and that lead me to find this old but good essay
<http://berglondon.com/blog/2010/09/04/b-a-s-a-a-p/>
“Smart as a puppy"
At this point it's opening the websocket, listening for commands on file comments and direct messaging the user who made the command (for more info?). Hope to get back to it a bit throughout the week on the evenings
coooool
what kind of commands?
are you imagining?
*/puppy open websocket and let yourself out
I think the simple proof on concept would be slack as a blogging tool (because it's text files and that's quick) . The idea is that people are in slack, sharing files, making changes, suggesting changes, etc. etc.  and then someone says: `/publish it` and away it goes to the blog/site what have you.
cool.
so you upload a .md file
it ends up on your blog
once slack turns on their collaborative document editing stuff...
who needs a CMS!
I hadn't heard about  the collaborative document editing. Is that coming?
<http://www.businessinsider.com/slack-buys-spaces-2014-9>
well. whaddya know.
who knows what that is going to evolve into though...
This looks interesting
<http://www.pandorabots.com/>
AIML = Alicebot?
yeah.
<http://www.alicebot.org/aiml.html>
yeah
i wonder how active pandorabots are -- i can't seem to make an account on their playground
worked for me using twitter to sign up
<https://github.com/spencermountain/nlp_compromise>
woah.
its not perfect but there are some impressive demos
<http://rawgit.com/spencermountain/nlp_compromise/master/client_side/basic_demo/index.html>
could definitely be useful in making slightly more intelligent bots
I remember chatting w/ an engineer @ BBN regarding voicemail transcription.  "Is it a human or a machine transcribing your voicemails?", he asked.  "How can you tell?"  "If they misspell words, it's human."
This is because when leaving me voicemail (via YouMail), my wife would say hello to the person transcribing the message.
I've used this one for doing n-grams &amp; finding string distances.
<https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural>
i like natural too
yeah, super cool.
NLTK is good if you're python-ing <http://www.nltk.org>

tracery (what powers that) looks kinda neat,  though not active as of late: <https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery>
Is there a preferable python-flavored template for a bot?
It feels like a lot of the examples are in javascript.
(or ruby)
<@U04S1QCPC> thanks for that, looks interesting
I like that a lot more than what I was reading about AIML
It'll start up a webhook for your bot's Real Time Messaging. Just point this <https://github.com/adregan/SlackFiles/blob/master/src/slack.py#L8> to the `.ini` with the slack token and change what events you're listening for here <https://github.com/adregan/SlackFiles/blob/master/src/clients.py#L34-L37>
Thanks <@U04UV5TEM>
<@U04SM6T2H>: did you set up this slack so 29pco employees could chat with each other? If so mission accomplished :wink:
yes
and so that we can spy on you
:wink:

So good.
I'm adding quoted tweet support to Slack-Twitter. <https://www.apichangelog.com/changes/f7ca9f60-c74a-4e8f-a38b-1c7a02cf7d31>
if someone quotes a tweet, the quoted tweet will be posted as well. if someone RTs a tweet that quotes a tweet, the quoted tweet inside the RT will be posted.
what if someone quotes a tweet inside a quoted tweet inside an RT? it won't post that tweet.
Happy birthday <@U04SS2NBF>!!
Ha, thanks, <@U04SM6T2H>! Last chance to make something of my 30s.
39?
howdy new users!
Hi there!
Yay, I finally finished my gem <https://github.com/geetotes/slactionmailer>
cool!
Not sure why anyone would really want to use this on a real application, but now you can communicate with a slack channel by just changing your actionmailer settings in rails
<@U04SR77Q1>: love the name, at least.
haha thanks, i definitely shoehorned the functionality so it would fit the cool name
hahaha
<@U04SR77Q1> now that's design! :simple_smile:
has anybody integrated Slack with VR in a zany way yet?
I'm getting one of these (eventually, who knows when it arrives) <https://www.tilt.com/campaigns/experimental-phone-vr-headset-from-china>
is there a testing place for slack bots? right now my gem just pushes its default test messages to a slack channel i own
<@U04S4763Y>: its only a matter of time
i just bought one of those sphero rolling robot things and was looking at their api thinking, how can I make this a slash command
fwiw, it would have to be something like bot -&gt; cloud -&gt; phonegap -&gt; sphero sdk -&gt; bluetooth -&gt; robot
<@U04SR77Q1> you could set it up here if you want
Any value in adding a #testing channel for this team?
go!
is that enabled?
<@U054AJ0CV> <@U053RBJP8> welcome
Thanks! Happy to join
Thanks! Great idea to set up the team.
Anyone know of a good tutorial for using the OAuth2 api with Python and Flask? I'm using RAuth and I'm having some trouble authenticating with the correct team when users belong to multiple Slack teams.
dang
what a great idea
for those interested: I found dev4slack via @slackapi and xococo's tweet about offering slack consulting
:simple_smile: :simple_smile:
welcome
okay, my first question is this: anyone have a good listing of private slack api methods
of course there is users.admin.invite, i've also found users.admin.setRegular and users.admin.setInactive, but couldn't find many others, at least documented ones out there
<@U05560TFT>: maybe we could make a repo that is just a markdown file or somesuch to share that knowledge
is there some sort of slack hackers github org?
was just thinking about that <@U05334HCE>
alternatively, ask slack to make them public, but i'm guessing the reason why they don't is because then why do you need slack plus (which has SAML/SSO support)
And there will always be open APIs they keep under wraps regardless. an open source list would be good.

I just wrote this
<https://medium.com/@benbrown/slack-is-the-operating-system-6bae1a6c0291>
I think you guys will appreciate it
I dig it.
One chord it struck w/ me was Tom Coates' dream of a world where IoT objects used chat rooms to communicate with each other.
totes
I dream of bots talking to bots
thats for the toot <@U04S1QCPC>
np!
I 100% agree with you, <@U04SM6T2H>. <https://twitter.com/sillygwailo/statuses/580840868862623745>
you (collective) should read this if you haven't already: <http://whoo.ps/2015/02/23/futures-of-text>
that essay is soo good
it hits on a lot of the things we're thinking about; well, i guess it's more accurate to say that it hits on a lot of the things that are inevitable
such a great post, <@U04SM6T2H>! definitely agree with you.
:simple_smile: thanks buster
this actually is a prequel to another post I'm writing specifically about what this type of app looks like
not 100% done, but yall can read here if you care to!

it's great stuff though.
This'll make for good conversation on @rands Slack team
?
He has a Slack team dealing w/ organization efficiencies / leadership.
Like, 400 people in there.
oh cool
yeah
i like the idea of messaging experience design. messages make it easy to think of everything as a conversation, in the context of people. and i think this might be why “bots” sounds more appropriate than “apps”. bots are anthropomorphized apps.
I hope to reach like
the non-tech leadership of big orgs
they are!
apps you can treat like robotic coworkers
apps that treat you like a person
exactly
but can still do things like a computer — like, I'm currently obsessed with the idea of parallel tasking
Reminds me of the old Jellyvision paper.
same 1:1 conversation
context-aware, friendly, casual, etc
happening 10x in parallel
oh that reminds me that slack should add geolocation info to the api
it already kinda knows right?
yes!
timezone dtection
but it would be cool to also get like
$user-&gt;atHome
context is my middle name
I built a plugin for Yahoo! messenger that used color to convey the timezone of the person you were direct messaging.
That way, if you were talking to someone +12h away, it would be dark.
And you would know you're waking them up.
coool
These are the guys that made You Don't Know Jack.
oh awesome
They listed fundamentals on how to make a human think they're talking to another human.
ICI – Interactive Conversation Interface
As my teammate said this morning, “the acronym needs an X in it!"
We discussed this a bit before but --
is there a way for a team admin to get the slack *team id* used for the OAUTH handshake *before* doing the oauth handshake?
besides *viewing source* ?
<@U04SM6T2H>: i've heard from companies that they've tried to move to slack from hipchat and cant because of massive issues w/ slack after 600 users
like what?
I'm in a slack right now with 782 users and i've experienced no problems
i can get specifics later, but i believe it's things like the UI is unusably slow
<@U04SM6T2H>: are you looking to get the team id one-time or programmatically getting it?
this company has 3k+ users
and another with 3800
hmmm
i'll go ping someone and check
1sec
<@U04S1QCPC> I want to make it so people can use our wiki
for themselves
it requires the team id as a config
so they can limit the ability to login
to just their own team
so, Ig uess, one time
but I would do it programatically if possible
ah ok – can't you access them to authorize slack before setting up the wiki?
I mean
i *could*
and then call `<http://team.info|team.info>`?
heh
hah
yeah
I mean I guess so
user installs it
auths their team
and at that point it locks down to the one team
no easier way really to do it, i dont think the team id is exposed anywhere in the UI
cool thanks for the info dudes
The person we met with from Slack last week (didn't get his name) said there was a known performance issue of orgs &gt;3k
still waiting to hear from friend about what issues they were having
they were about to move to hall from hipchat but the day they planned to do it, hipchat bought hall
they think because hipchat got knowledge they were about to leave hah
<@U05560TFT>: knowledge?
ah ok
information
whatever
hey <@U055SN4LF>!!
long time fan :wink:
Luke!
<@U04SM6T2H>: <http://githubengineering.com/deploying-branches-to-github-com/> regarding good examples of chatbots, although these are only nominally interactive.
“ChatOps” is a good term.
Googled the history of the term, and came across this deck: <https://speakerdeck.com/jnewland/chatops-at-github>
cool
yeah I gotta get one of the multichannel bots turned on in here :simple_smile:
to show off :simple_smile:
Please.
I mean devops stuff is cool
but business process
heh
<@U05560TFT> @ben as the guy who designed two very similar products (Socialcast/Twitter) I can guarantee that Slack is going to have enormous hurdles dealing w/ larger orgs.
<@U053NQZN1>: i'd love to hear more of your thoughts on this!
<@U04SM6T2H>: please do add your bots! maybe there should be a bot-only channel.
heard back from friend with scaling problems
he said at the time, slack stated a limit of 1500
and the client just wouldn't load past that at all
This looks like a rad bot
<http://meekan.com/slack/>
Hi Ben, and everyone. Nice to be here. We love our bot.
Hey guys, I'm with matty :simple_smile:
hey guys! :simple_smile:
Hope you don't mind me crashing: @brttb on Twitter
Nice medium post, <@U04SM6T2H> :simple_smile:
<@U04SM6T2H>: I really like the "MXD" term, going to drop it everywhere now
Yes
Haha thanks! Yes!!

<@U04TLHGSC>: I wonder if you were just the first person to suggest domain squatting a slack subdomain
could be!
I'm afraid for our children
I just tried to go squat on <http://hillaryclinton.slack.com|hillaryclinton.slack.com> but looks like it's already taken. By Hillary.
niiiice
well that was a nice try, at least
jeb bush still isn't officially running
so his is probably available
<http://interconnected.org/home/2006/03/08/playsh>
^^ I keep thinking about making an RPG bot
or a bot that causes the thief from Zork to appear in your channel and stab people
unless people are like kill thief with axe
<@U04SM6T2H>: I've registered <http://twooted.slack.com|twooted.slack.com>. You can thank me later.
Anyone know if it's possible to create slash commands programatically using the API?
e.g. It'd be great if I could setup integrations automatically after granting with oauth without the user having to copy/paste URLs/tokens etc.
I have wondered this myself.
I get the impression that this is how official integrations that create slash commands work.
I've noticed that if you create a slash command + incoming webhook, the original message i.e. `/something foo` is suppressed. But AFAIK this isn't true for official integrations. So I figure they may be using the RTM thingy.
But that wouldn't explain how the slash command gets added to the autocompleter list.
¯\_(?)_/¯
I suppose that may just work by virtue of being an official integration.
<@U05334HCE>: just looked really quick, looks like when you step through the UI it's not doing XHR requests to add a custom slash command, so it's not going to easy to do it and there wouldn't be an API :disappointed:
There is not currently a way to do this
oauth-able slash commands is something we're aware of and will be working on soon.
sweeg
making slash commands that work like giphy (i.e. shows the command in the channel, and posts the response to the channel) is another such thing
the `/giphy` command is one of those things that uses internal magics that we're trying to turn into externally available magics.
here's an API question
whats the difference between an API token prefixed with xoxs vs xoxp?
i'm assuming xoxs = secret and xoxp = public?
and xox is because slack loves developers?
/keanu
or xoxco?
Howdy, everyone. I'm relatively new to Slack, but fascinated by the possibilities. Holler.
Howdy, <@U05676C84> !
Re: Ben's RPG idea, I have a text/web-based RPG that I ported to work via Twitter tweets or DMs. Would be fun to port to Slack. :wink:
<@U05676C84>: whaaaat - let me work on that
Question: Is there a way, either built in or via an API, to see when the channel topic was set, and by whom? Similar to IRC.
<@U05334HCE>: looks like <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.info> will
yup
`resp.channel.topic.last_set` === unix timestamp
Okay, but nothing built in? Would be nice to see in the sidebar channel info panel. cc <@U04S1QCPC>
doesnt appear so
yeah nothing in the app will show you that, unfortunately
Our team has a lot of fun trolling each other and such with topics. Would be great info to expose in the channel info sidebar.
would be very cool to have client side userscripts a la greasemonkey
if you search the channel for “set the channel topic: ” that last change will show up
that's less than ideal though
indeed
could have a bot you could query
Yeah I think that's what I'll do
/topicinfo or something
<@U05676C84|patrickmcurry> cleared channel topic
bold
Did I just empty the topic? Whoops.
<@U04SM6T2H|benbrown> set the channel topic: topic switching
#justnewbthings
:simple_smile:
i've been wondering for a few weeks/months now if slack could be used for a single person
as kind of a command and control center
with a few bots you can get all your notifications and be able to send commands to do this
like post to twitter or get bank account balance etc
replacing apps with slack i guess
really, just having a hubot that supports multiple adapters would be great
<@U05560TFT>: I've heard of many people doing this. I have a private team with every integration under the sun. So far it's been great for tracking stuff, notes to self, and lots of bot testing. 
<@U05560TFT> I have a household Slack used by me and my wife, starting to think up integrations
kinda want to build something that talks to Mint
but for now it's a glorified Pinterest board that also collects documents
and Nest :simple_smile:
Slack as homekit comepetitor?
totes
I've been tinkering with that for a while :simple_smile:
@HOUSE ARMOR MODE
ps I'm Batman
And at the end of the first season, the Joker  buys Heroku and takes control of the bots.
I've already made the joke that Ben's future is becoming some kind of Howard Hughes hermit surrounded by little robots
and no one ever knows if they're communicating with him, or just his bots
soon
Slack/Heroku is very “center of a dystopian future” kind of stuff.
There is nothing dystopian about riding around in a ball-shaped robot car that uses text messages as its UI!
<@U04TLHGSC>: slack as homekit _interface_
slack as smartthings interface
and nest and dropcam and whatever else
slack as roomie remote interface etc
Right - I think homekit as the interface (not the devics)
but I think - slack as universal interface.
Slack killed Yahoo! Pipes
I want my standing desk to shame me by reporting to my team's channel that I set it to “sit” mode
"slack as smartthings interface” The guys at <http://thington.com|thington.com> are working on something like this.
I'd like to make a Slack bot that detects when I'm writing something to someone, and if they interrupt me, it automatically sends them a DM with “Let me finish!"
the bot would need to be able to read my brain because sometimes I have to pause to think something through.
Ah yes, Kanye Bot
:clap:
I wouldn't call it that, for reasons, but sure.
Ego Bot
same difference
ahah <@U04S4763Y> great idea!
good use of the “user is typing” messages that happen
I can report that Huginn works pretty well with Slack as a webook. <https://github.com/cantino/huginn>
good to see huginn is still kicking
next up is trying to go the other way, from Slack to Huginn
hey dudes
I just turned on my latest bot <@U0614LL8Y>
<@U0614LL8Y>: hi
he's live in the <#C04SPC24T> channel
He works in channels he's been invited to
want
:simple_smile:
at a previous company we had an irc rpg thingy where you could gain exp and challenge each other to battles and such
would love something like that for slack
totes
coding the ability to drop items in a channel right now
weekend slack project: <https://github.com/dblock/slack-gamebot> but for hubot
what happens after you accept a challenge? does it actually facilitate playing different games, or you use some additional commands to tell it who won/lost?
<@U05334HCE>: the latter
drop grue
look
haha oops
gamebot reset hunter2
ok enough of that for tonight. :simple_smile:
dungeon_master looks suspiciously like a robot
so much more than a robot :simple_smile:
my wife and kid are away so
alas, the dungeon master bot can't kick users out of channels
so i can't enforce like, user is in 1 channel only ever
maybe possible with a different type of api token
Funny that was my first feature request
?
kicking users
Yeah
Otherwise you can't have rooms change while the user is away
Or they could explore rooms they've been to, without having to travel through a proper path 
yeah
i kind of want to enforce navigating
one channel at a time
heh
My approach was main gameplay was via DM, but announcements and "calls for help" in the shared channels.
But not quite right if each "room" has its own chat channel.
ooo my LEGO ANTMAN just arrived
hahah
<@U05676C84>: yeah I ended up building all the like “moo” operations in dm
so you create, describe, add verbs in the dm to dungeon_master
but then drop things into main channels for other people to interact with
not sure if its worth actually figuring out how to enforce “presence” in a “map”
ooorrr, I could stop making it abuot channels
and instead, the channel is your “party” and you navigate through a map together
might be more fun
each channel is a holodeck
heh
 That definitely solves the kicking problem 
Although doesn't allow for purposeful joining of two people / teams in a persistent world 
Oh I like the idea of channel = party. Makes the decision to go through a door an important one that affects everyone, and hopefully causes fights between friends. ;-)
Question: does a topic change make a channel appear unread, and/or count toward the unread message count? Will it give your slack icon the little red unread badge?
Answer: yep, it makes the channel appear unread
Here's the near final version of my next Medium article about building slackbot apps
<https://medium.com/p/495f9d1e87da/edit>
<@U04SM6T2H>: Good read. Interesting about doing the standup in parallel. But isn't there some benefit for doing it "serially"? sometimes I hear what others said before me, and it makes me change my mind about what I was going to say
also, you know these guys? <https://tatsu.io/> ?
I had a similar reaction to <@U055FHACC> about the standup bot… for me, standups are more about listening and helping others who are blocked or pondering something unresolved as they are about me presenting my status. Bots can help with the writing, but not the listening and helping parts. That said, I think there's a lot of invisible time saved by just not having to wait for everyone to meet in person, return from meetings, VC in remote people, etc. Maybe moving to a virtual standup actually would save 13 minutes, but they would come from a bunch of things that people don't even think of as taking time or being work.
I should have started with: overall though I love the post! :simple_smile:
I'd also add, in the context of our own bot, when scheduling meeting we had to weight in the benefits of doing it in parallel (as you described, buy mainly for the reason of trying not to spam the channel with scheduling talk), vs. doing it all on the channel. We chose (for now, at least) to do it all on-channel because seeing what others are choosing helps the team converge into one preference and aids the scheduling process
So if I see that two people before me preferred a meeting to happen on Thursday, I'd go with that too. Even if initially I was thinking that Wednesday is better
Yeah, we have a bot that justs make sure we go in order, and that everything is recorded, topics that are tabled are returned to, etc.
Overall I love the post too
guys guys thank you so much for the feedback!
I'm making some final revs now you are awesome
DEfinitely tehre is value in the sequential meeting too
or hearing your peers talk and responding at the time
Partially I was just looking for a way to illustrate this *class* of bot
so hopefully peopel won't get too locked into this one example
maybe I'll qualify that
<@U055FHACC>: yeah I saw that
there is also
<http://my.scrumbot.co/>
“hearing” your peers “talk"
both of those do it in sequence
YEah my thinking was
if you are already doing your scrum *in slack*
just waiting for someone to type it all out
is super annoying!
also *all* scrums I've ever been a part of are super annoying and time wasting
because most of the time peopel aren't listening
OF COURSE there are good scrums
AGAIN, thanks everyone!!
<http://bndr.meteor.com/> looks neat (via the SlackAPI Twitter account)
agree on the no good scrums
<@U04SM6T2H>: You know what's funny about those gifs.
The pmbot responds too quickly.
Maybe you're doing that just to simulate it better in the gif.
But it breaks "the uncanny valley of text response”, which, if it isn't a thing, should be.
I'm assuming response speed, or simulating an appropriate delay, is a part of anything involved with Turing Test competitors.
Does the slack api allow for “so and so is typing” status updates, so you can simulate a response being thought about?
The bot sends messages at most every 2 seconds
we have a “game loop” type thing
where every 2 secnods, all the active “tasks” tick
and if a conversation in the task has a pending mesage, it sends
BUT YES
the gifs are a bit fast
