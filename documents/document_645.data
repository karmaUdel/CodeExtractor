U2MLC3R4G : Hello all,I need a little thoughts on the below code 
```
type Route
         = Companies
          | EditCompany String
route : Route
route = EditCompany "first"

&lt;--After I set the route above How do I extract the "first" from variable route --&gt;
&lt;-- I did use a case like below --&gt;

companyId = case route of
  EditCompany someString -&gt; someString
  _ -&gt; Debug.crash "this will never happened" &lt;-- Is there another thing to use instead of Debug.crash here . Given we definitely know this will never happened.--&gt;
```

I wonder what to use in the case that will never happened. like in the above example.
Now I could noly use Debug.crash

U0EUHKVGB : You’re going to need to explain a bit more what thoughts you’d like to hear :slightly_smiling_face:
U101G7VEX : <@U0EUHKVGB> It looks like this map thingy is doable with just CSS and SVG... <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TM63ing6jY>
U0EUHKVGB : Yeah, that map would be pretty easy to make in Elm.
U101G7VEX : it would?
U0EUHKVGB : <@U2MLC3R4G>, please use ``` ``` for code blocks
U2MLC3R4G : thank you <@U0EUHKVGB>
U0EUHKVGB : <@U101G7VEX> Yep, very easy. Make the SVG shapes in an editor as they did, then use `elm-svg`: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/svg/latest>
U101G7VEX : interesting, I'll look into it... thanks
U0LPMPL2U : <@U2MLC3R4G> the compiler can't guarantee that the other cases won't hapen
U0LPMPL2U : same reason you need the `_` case here:```
case 1 of
  1 -&gt; "one"
  _ -&gt; "other"
```

U2MLC3R4G : Yes <@U0LPMPL2U>. What would we use instead of Debug.crash here. Do you have any alternatives. To make it compiles.

U5ABF3BH7 : hi everyone. I am getting a list ‘rolodexList’ from my decoder. From it I want to build my sub model location with the values I am getting to build the field hospitals, hospices, etc..  location should look like { location | hospitals = hospitals, hospices = hospices..}The following code gives me an error that I have the same variable used twice in my let—in statement.  ```Types.LoadRolodexLists (Ok rolodexList) -&gt;
    let
        hospitals =
            getInstitutions rolodexList "hospital"
        updatedLocation = Types.UpdateLocation (Location.ChgHospitals hospitals)

        hospices =
            getInstitutions rolodexList "hospice"
        updatedLocation = Types.UpdateLocation (Location.ChgHospices hospices)

  …….

    in
    ( { model | location = updatedLocation}, Cmd.none )```

U5ABF3BH7 : If I use different name, I will not get all the updates I need. How can I update the submodels in one shot?

U0LPMPL2U : <@U2MLC3R4G> based on the types, it looks like the case statement needs to return a string
U0LPMPL2U : Is there some string that makes sense to return for that case?
U2MLC3R4G : <@U0LPMPL2U> I might use some other strings. But If you use some strings there instead of Debug.crash "something".. Some reader might thinks that this branch will be possible to happen

U0LPMPL2U : Hmm,  I think I see what you're trying to do. You want to get the string parameter out of the route?
U2MLC3R4G : Yes
U0LPMPL2U : Your problem is that `companyId` doesn't always exist. Only for certain routes
U5ZKYURNY : hi all, I’d like to try to set focus on an input element but don’t care whether it succeeds or not, I know I could simply return the original model and Cmd.none in the update function for the result message but just curious is it possible to convert a Task to “Cmd Never”? So that I don’t need to handle the result message at all, something like ``` attemptIgnoreResult : Task x a -&gt; Cmd Never ```
U0LPMPL2U : The signature should probably be:```
companyId -&gt; Route -&gt; Maybe String
```
