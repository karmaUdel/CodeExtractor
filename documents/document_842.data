U5VGKQ2SY : in `reservations = ec.describe_instances`, Where is ec defined?
U0PKTUWKH : <@U5VGKQ2SY> `ec = boto3.client('ec2')`
U5VGKQ2SY : nevermind
U5VGKQ2SY : <https://gist.github.com/ryansb/c5807c6785f326e9510d> &lt;-- no brackets around tag-key
U0PKTUWKH : <@U5VGKQ2SY> THANKS! ur example helped me to realize i was useing `'tag-key'` instead of `'tag-value'`
U0PKTUWKH : and this is why things were failing
U5VGKQ2SY : full disclosure, NOT MY EXAMPLE hahaha
U0PKTUWKH : well not ur example but whatever u provided as an example
U0PKTUWKH : :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
U5VGKQ2SY : glad it worked hahaha cheers
U5GJVTRGB : Hi Guys...
```application.add_url_rule(
     apipath + "/apis/
     view_func=api_view,
     methods=[ 'GET', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE' ])
```
This is how i'm adding rules to my flask-app
but for ONLY patch request it's giving error as

``` 
&lt;html&gt;&lt;title&gt;405: Method Not Allowed&lt;/title&gt;&lt;body&gt;405: Method Not Allowed&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;[
```

Even if the method is there for PATCH, why PATCH isn't getting routed ?


any mistakes or something to add up ?

U5CRANMFV : how do I make`01` to `Jan`.
?

U5U4MSHC1 : have a dictionary mapping which would pretty much do the trick
U5CRANMFV : it's complicated. the standard library won't help me?
U5S8CNULD : `data = {01: 'Jan'}`
U5U4MSHC1 : you can use `datetime` though
U5S8CNULD : our use `datetime`
U5CRANMFV : `calendar.month_abbr`
U5U4MSHC1 : yeah, i was looking at the same <@U5CRANMFV>
U5U4MSHC1 : <@U5CRANMFV> but it starts with empty item
U5CRANMFV : can't understand how to pass a number to return the month
U5CRANMFV : ```In [99]: calendar.month_abbr[3]Out[99]: 'Mar'```

U5U4MSHC1 : ```In[14]: calendar.month_abbr[int("03")]Out[14]: 'Mar'```

U582KCWUB : eh I have a stupid issue with imports, what I am trying to do: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/oajyhncno1xz5p4/Screenshot%202017-06-29%2012.17.07.png?dl=0>
what I get: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'exercises'`
the `playground` dir in the project root is a virtualenv dir, all worked fine until I added extra directory structure (the `python-mega-course-udemy` dir) any help please?

U5NMSURAQ : `.exercises`?
U582KCWUB : <@U5NMSURAQ> hmm doesnt seem to work
U61FDK1EE : import pygame
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((600,480))

done = False

font = pygame.font.SysFont("comicsansms", 72)

text = font.render("Hello, World", True, (0, 40, 0))

while not done:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            done = True
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN and event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
            done = True

    screen.fill((255, 255, 255))
    screen.blit(text,
                (320 - text.get_width() // 2, 240 - text.get_height() // 2))

    pygame.display.flip()

U61FDK1EE : I WANT ONLY THE TEXT AND NOT THE CONTAINING PYGAME WINDOW
U5LNXQHN3 : No all-capitals please... if you're hoping to just draw the text on top of your desktop background, then unfortunately that's not (practically) possible
U5LNXQHN3 : That would require that you create a transparent window, which is beyond the scope of what pygame is for
U61FDK1EE : so is there a way to add text which can be moved anywhere on screen
