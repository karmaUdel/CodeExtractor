Does that work?
you could probably simplify it a little for yourself if you can fit the whole file in memory and then re-write it
I thought there is more simple way...
Also, if you use `with open` it handles closing the file for you. For those newer pythonistas, these are called context managers and are awesome
<@U1NSCAY6R> cool)
Though there probably is a "better" way.
<@U1BP42MRS> oh! that's really simple) thanks a lot, forget that it's possible to replace in the whole text not just in line
It saves a few iterations, but it will load the whole file in - so be aware of how large the file is!
Oh, it's just hundreds of lines, it will be ok.
You can make rabbitmq faster by using the HiPe compile. But I doubt that's the problem, as you wont notice a difference there until you hit scale.
so has anyone tried to setup travis with a public python repository that has a private repository as a dependency? From what I can tell I need to have a private travis accnt to even do this =(.
well it make sense
this wouldn't be an issue except that my org has run out of private repos.
i think if i used a dependency link in my setup.py with the env_var of a user token that has access and format the dependency link url with the token it should be able to pull the dependency down.
a lil hacky.
well if the repo is public people would have access
not sure if that's ok for you
not with the env var
oh sorry I miss env var
yeah it could work
yea, i'll have to create a new user and give them read access but it sounds feasible. something for the morning!
ok, i found a good resource. i think this will do the trick. <https://github.com/blog/1270-easier-builds-and-deployments-using-git-over-https-and-oauth>
I'd guess you can just use an ssh key with access to the repo
<@U1BP42MRS> travis isn't letting me put in an ssh key.
it shows me where i can in the docs but it looks like that's the spot for a travis pro account.
Oh yeah I'm thinking of your hack, make it an envvar, echo it to a file and then clone 
Travis is pricey
oh ok.
Maybe make a basic auth user and use https 
Then in the before process stripe in the creds 
yea i found this too. i think you commented @nerdwaller. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4830856/is-it-possible-to-use-pip-to-install-a-package-from-a-private-github-repository#comment55105837_27901245>
And it's too late to edit to fix the error
<@U5KUA7XPG> please don't cross post 
Give the question in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> some time before broadening the ask
Okey, I will delete one. Should I delete in Django or here?
If it's Django specific, I'd leave the question there. If you don't get any traction within a few hours, then you can share the question here (note the share tip, per the intro doc, vs copy/paste).
In case you need the intro doc :point_up::skin-tone-4: 
Okey, so in the future I will post my question in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> at first. After some time without response I will paste it here. Is it a good habit?
:thumbsup:
Thanks for quick intro.
minor correction, "share" it here :slightly_smiling_face: <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/203274767-Share-messages-in-Slack>
