U5FC7BE0G : <@U3SJEDR96> Awesome! That's exactly the solution I was lookign for! String in the error case is fine. Thanks!
U641LDZFU : oh wow, so if I am getting errors on the "big array" like ```The 5th entry has this type:
{ ..., nodeContent : { ..., chatId : ..., userId : ... } }

But the 6th is:

{ ..., nodeContent : { ... } }

Hint: Problem in the `nodeContent` field. Looks like a record is missing these
fields: chatId and userId```

U641LDZFU : although the nodeContent have different type aliases
U641LDZFU : there is an error with my type aliases?
U641LDZFU : or I have to construct them in the list?
U2LAL86AY : <@U641LDZFU> in elm lists, arrays, dicts and trees and other data that resembles collections of elements - need to have the same type.
you need `chatId`  and `userId` on the 6-th element - which i guess is of different type.
Can you please give your type aliases you use in that list?

U641LDZFU : Thanks, I think my problem is I need to use another union type... ```type alias ChatMessage =    { id : Int
    , chatId : Int
    , userId : Int
    , content : List (Html Msg)
    }


type alias Transition =
    { transitionType : String, toStoryNode : Int, text : Maybe String }


type alias ChatNodeContent =
    { id : Int, nodeType : String, nodeContent : ChatMessage, state : Maybe String, transitions : List Transition }


type alias NewsItem =
    { id : Int
    , content : List (Html Msg)
    , userId : 1
    , chatId : 2
    }


type alias NewsItemNodeContent =
    { id : Int, nodeType : String, nodeContent : NewsItem, state : Maybe String, transitions : List Transition }


type StoryNode
    = ChatNode ChatNodeContent
    | NewsItemNode NewsItemNodeContent```

U641LDZFU : I think I should probably rename,  ChatNodeContent, and NewsItemContent, then create a new union type for the nodeContent which can be one of NewsItem or ChatMessage
U2LAL86AY : hmm.. processing .. :smile:
U2LAL86AY : if you have an image will help.
U2LAL86AY : ```type alias NewsItem =    { id : Int    , content : List (Html Msg)    , userId : 1    , chatId : 2    }
```
This should not compile

U2LAL86AY : you have values mixed with types.
U2LAL86AY : also is not so good to have `content : List (Html Msg) ` is better to just keep the data on your model , not html + data.
U641LDZFU : Ah, that was causing me trouble :slightly_smiling_face:
U2LAL86AY : i will do a rewrite here.
U641LDZFU : Ah sorry, that was an progress update to: ``` type alias ChatMessage =
    { id : Int
    , chatId : Int
    , userId : Int
    , content : List (Html Msg)
    }


type alias Transition =
    { transitionType : String, toStoryNode : Int, text : Maybe String }


type alias ChatNodeItem =
    { id : Int, nodeType : String, nodeContent : StoryNodeContent, state : Maybe String, transitions : List Transition }


type alias NewsItem =
    { id : Int
    , content : List (Html Msg)
    }


type alias NewsNodeItem =
    { id : Int, nodeType : String, nodeContent : StoryNodeContent, state : Maybe String, transitions : List Transition }


type StoryNode
    = ChatNode ChatNodeItem
    | NewsNode NewsNodeItem


type StoryNodeContent
    = NewsItemContent NewsItem
    | ChatMessageContent ChatMessage




type alias Player =
    { visitedStoryNodes : List StoryNode
    , currentStoryNode : Maybe StoryNode
    }


type alias Model =
    { player : Player
    }

```

U2LAL86AY : i understand what you are going after.
U2LAL86AY : why do you need to have `content : List (Html Msg)`
U2LAL86AY : auch ! :smile:
U641LDZFU : Vielen Dank!
U2LAL86AY : ```type Msg
    = NoOp


type alias Model =
    { player : Player }


type alias Player =
    { visitedStoryNodes : List StoryNode, currentStoryNode : Maybe StoryNode }


type StoryNode
    = ChatNode ChatNodeItem
    | NewsNode NewsNodeItem


type StoryNodeContent
    = NewsItemContent NewsItem
    | ChatMessageContent ChatMessage


type alias ChatNodeItem =
    { id : Int, nodeType : String, nodeContent : StoryNodeContent, state : Maybe String, transitions : List Transition }


type alias NewsNodeItem =
    { id : Int, nodeType : String, nodeContent : StoryNodeContent, state : Maybe String, transitions : List Transition }


type alias ChatMessage =
    { id : Int, content : List (Html Msg), chatId : Int, userId : Int }


type alias NewsItem =
    { id : Int, content : List (Html Msg) }


type alias Transition =
    { transitionType : String, toStoryNode : Int, text : Maybe String }

```

U2LAL86AY : i need that function causing the problem
U641LDZFU : The problem is it's many :slightly_smiling_face:
U641LDZFU : I think I will have another hack at it tomorrow
U2LAL86AY : ```Hint: Problem in the `nodeContent` field. Looks like a record is missing these fields: chatId and userId
```
