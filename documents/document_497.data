this is probably about to not be elm-related much longer, as I might just have to not bring it up and explain the ways it could be solved, if it does
might work
oh, hey
do you know exactly what the URLs will be ahead of time?  You could special-case the bad ones just for the demo
they are all ok now, it's just the code that will be iffy (and we are heavily looking at it together and there will be eyebrow-raising)
Typically, broken image links on the web are handled by the browser by showing some default "broken image" thumbnail
Are you trying to do something different?
good point
the html I posted allows you to do just that
i am about to try that, too
put the placeholder image in the img tag and the actual image from the json in the data field
i forgot to mention that it is an Svg.img... hope that won't matter...
`Svg.image` even, oh boy
umm, the placeholder is Svg.image or you have preloaded to data and generated an Svg.image
` xlinkHref snack.imagepath`
crazy, i know
haha fun fun
This is a table of users with broken avatars
yes, i like that best. i just remove the `onerror`-handler
would you want to now show a row at all if the image was missing?
thanks joel. that, and that it should be checked server-side, is good now.
or show a different image than the browser default thumbnail?
yes
that's what i did
