            }```
ah, so that doesn’t let the first argument have any extra fields in it
you want `{ a | permitNumber : String, ... }` to allow “any record including these fields”
(rather than “this exact record”)
ah.
it’s a super useful feature I didn’t discover for ages
This is how you make a function work on similar types?
It's how you say a function works on "any record with at least these fields", while also restricting that function so it can _only_ access those fields and no others
Thanks much!
Does this work on return types? or should I give the exact field names for returns?
you’ll want the same in the return types
