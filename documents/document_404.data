```
Just to be clear, the ellipsis are not part of the code. Just using them to show that there is more there that doesn't matter.
so why is it used?
if u just can simply write round i |&gt; toString
why? \i -&gt; round i -&gt; toString
and a quick recap
\i is the name of the function
round i is what has to do
and |&gt; toString is function toString that gets aribute result of round
the function has no name
`i` is the name of the first parameter of the function
ohhh
undestood
Sometimes it's just more simple *not* to name a function
anonymous functions are useful when you need to pass a function to a function but the function you're passing isn't useful elsewhere
Makes sense
:slightly_smiling_face:
but it's usually kept simple, If the anonymous function is too big it can usually be more clear to declare a regular function but within the function scope (the function that calls your anon func)
Yes, move that on a let block, give it a meaningful name and your code is more clear :slightly_smiling_face:
thank you :smile:
what happens if there are two subscriptions to the same `port`? When the JS sends a value, do both fire?
How would you implement this?
I don't know how the runtime ties Subscriptions to ports - so I can't answer this.... but it is not inconcievable that it could queue the Msg objects and cycle them through....
I grant that that raises "issues" with what happens while processing the first Msg ... vs. the second
Saddly, it is very hard to compose low level things made of ports - like I can build ports to read/write `localStorage` - but seems impossible to use it from more than one place.
So, sigh, I build more `ports`
sounds like something that's easy to try :slightly_smiling_face:
Re: localstorage, the best way to handle this is to only have one subscription port that sends all localstorage data, tagged appropriately in the value object
<@U601ELFEG> yes both will fire
I coded up an example: <https://ellie-app.com/3NXjZdPrxyJa1/0>
oh - thanks!
hey!   so i've been tinkering with elm a bit... and i wonder, what happens when the model gets huge and complica- er, sophisticated? is there advice on how to decompose a large model?
depends on how the model is getting complex
<@U6734UL1Z> Check out elm-spa-example. <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example>
thats for when you really are making an SPA. What sometimes happens though is that people see a model with 10 fields and think "oh no this is too big" as a sort of instinctive reaction.
How big is your model getting?
Richard's talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoA4Txr4GUs&amp;t=2s>
I don't know if that is published on youtube yet, but there is a direct link in random somewhere
Yeah, I think it's still unlisted on Elm Europe.
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ihTgEYiKpI>
boo yeah
awww, I just got it.
thanks for the resources :slightly_smiling_face: i don't yet actually have a real model to worry about.  i was just following along with someone's youtube videos... and started imaginging the possible features i might add, and wondered at how the model might grow.
<@U6734UL1Z> the advice typically given is to not rush to compartmentalize your code. As you add more and more features, at some point it becomes apparent that you have a collection of related data and functions that interact with that data that would make sense as its own module. But the threshold for "large and unwieldy" will likely be much higher than what you're used to if you're coming from a non-functional background, because the type system makes it really easy to see what everything is doing.
<@U6734UL1Z> number one advice, and hardest to follow, is: don't worry for now. If you run into trouble we'll help you :)
just curious, are the folks that help create libraries and modules for Elm doing so using Elm or Haskell?
total beginner (doing the Pragmatic Studio course btw and things are really finally starting to click!) and am wondering if you also have to learn Haskell before you can ever contribute
People who want to contribute to the Elm *compiler* use Haskell, 0 elm involved.
makes total sense. thank you. i see this place dies on a friday night while I'm just over here amped to be learning Elm (and vim, git, the command line, and html/css)
Well it picks up with bad advice after everyone is nice and liquored.
The cool kids are still here. :neutral_face:
:beers: I can do both
after an entire day... everything compiles.
Ship it
I... don't know how to run this update message...
What is it?
So a button in my view calls `ShuffleList` which calls `SetGame` ... Now `RunGame` is the driving logic for the robot players. So I need to get RunGame going... but Rungame also needs to call itself when it's done.
If you want a delay, Task.sleep 
Sry Process.sleep
Is that command I can pass in `SetGame`? If I use commands in `SetGame`, do they take effect before or after the model is updated?
updates when update returns
<@U23SA861Y> I'm guessing that means the model takes effect after commands? But to be sure, in the case of `Message -&gt; ( { model | canChange = change }, DoAThing )` , the thing is done before the model is updated.
After each msg
No the model is updated immediate and do a thing gets queued up to happen
Oh. Good. I need to look up this Process.sleep
... And learn to use tasks
I'm still not sure why there's a distinction between commands and tasks myself
Tasks can fail and be chained
They indicate a result as opposed to an event
commands are the only things that can be sent to the runtime, right?
and you need to "lift" a task into a command to actually run it?
Yes it needs to be transformed by specifying what to do with both success and failure.
It came up the other day in this or <#C0CJ3SBBM|general> but I didn't really follow the conversation so carefully. `Random` seems to issue commands directly rather than letting you chain them with `Task`, right?
is there a reason for that or is the design still under consideration or something like that?
I imagine randomness can't "fail" in any meaningful way, but my intuition says it should be something like a `Task Never`
There seems to be some implementation details that restrict it. A task may make sense however. 
I gotcha
But ideally, it would be a task if those details were resolved you think?
Likely it would be like Time.now   Task x value
ah, yeah, `Task x Time` is a little more direct, even though `Task Never Time` even though the latter is a bit more principled
It's more direct but it causes chaining issues
right. It would require a bit of plumbing
Question about elm make. I got around to actually packaging my program properly, putting the elm files in `src/` and tailoring everything nicely. And it builds and it compiles my modules and puts the elmo and elmi files in the `elm-stuff/` directory. But I can't figure out where (if anywhere) it is putting the compiled JS files
Oh, it looks like I still need to specify the .elm file.
I wonder. Is there a way to specify the file to build in the elm-package.json?
Not that I know of
No worries.
I have a throwaway project I set up following the tutorial that works perfectly. Can't recreate it for my existing project though... I don't really mind manual but, I have to give it another try later.
everyone seems to use a different setup though...
hi, does anyone know how to display a string unquoted in elm-repl?
i have a function that generates a multiline formatted string (of GLSL), and I want to see what it looks like with actual linebreaks, not interspersed \n escapes
<@U1ZCL9GAX> Unfortunately, there's no print function in Elm. I don't think there's a way to do it --- as odd as that sounds.
ok
`print : String -&gt; ()` with a definition like `print = flip Debug.log ()` might work. Not sure if that escapes things, but worth a try..
oh, I guess `Debug.log` does work in the repl... interesting
Also, I seem to remember that `elm-make` looks for a module named `Main` if not explicitly passed a path to an entry point. That seems like it's worth a try
Basically the same as using the `object[variablekey]` syntax in JS
Nope; since you have no compile-time guarantees that this key exists. One option is using a Dict, another option is using a union type to represent the updatable keys, and use a `case..of` to write the appropriate update logic for each possibility
<@U1ZCL9GAX> my suggestion actually seems to work, even if it adds some extra cruft :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U5W5F6QGP> just wanted to point out that `object[variableKey]` is one of the reasons why Elm exists :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks! 
That's a hell of an API call :aussie_revconga_parrot:, is your use case a big form that posts *all* of the data to the server?
There is also multiple of those forms, all of which have to have data persisted to localstorage
I picked a fun one to start converting to see what my CTO thinks of elm
I _think_ I would attempt to describe my Form as a sort of AST, and have the view and logic be built on top of that; so you final form becomes the result of representing your actual form as that AST
I may come to the same conclusion
I learn through being terrible and ruining everything though, mistakes help me a lot 
I always try not to jump too far ahead of myself
Yeah, that's a great way to learn :slightly_smiling_face:
No harm in discovering (the hard way) why something doesn't work out; and you may still come to different conclusions on a way to handle this that works for you
Yup, it's still easier than jumping face-first into a complex solution that you might not have needed
Is there an easy way to define multiple dictionary members at once upfront? Can't see anything in the docs
I've cobbled something together that maybe worth considering <https://ellie-app.com/3PgPmqNtYRRa1/0>
The idea is to see a mutation to your giant record as a mutation that is modelled with a union type and you just build a log of mutations and then transform this log into a server request
That is a very interesting and left-field way of thinking about this problem
would never have considered that, hmmm
I've successfully used this approach in a tedious UI - I just pushed the mutations to the server as simple json and handled the gritty details there
AND: these other 6 fields show
I do like this approach though, and it may be very relevant to an internal tool I will be making next week
true, if you need your current state you have to jump through some hoops. It is fun to think about, so basically what you would have is a "read-view" that holds the current state to your eventlog and that is being updated every time a mutation is registered and that you want to apply logic to... in that case the 300 explicit fields approach seems the only sane choice if you're not going to make a prototype only consisting of hacks *g*
re defining entries in a dict up-front - `Dict.fromList [ ( "key", "val" ), ( "other", "otherVal" ) ]`
I really appreciate you going above and beyond with that little ellie sample, thanks heaps!
In a run-off-the-mill eventsourced system your dependency logic would be expressed as a saga, you still would have to have a way of expressing "the current state" and somehow let that knowledge flow through the types. I'll meditate on that, sounds interesting
The fight with encoders has pretty much broken my spirit for now
I don't think there's currently any way to create a Json encoder or decoder automatically
It's a feature that will surely show up..... eventually....
I need to write a little parser for Prolog terms, which parser package you suggest to use? There are too many :slightly_smiling_face:
the encoder would be absolutely massive
it was going so well up until now :disappointed:
<@U2J1FUQTZ> I recommend `elm-tools/parser`
<@U5W5F6QGP> writing encoders for records can be a little tedious, though it pays off when you represent your internal state differently from how the API needs it. Now, if you have a `Dict String String`, you could `Dict.toList |&gt; List.map (Tuple.mapSecond Encode.string) |&gt; Encode.object` :wink:
I actually have an Array (Dict String String)
Oh. What seems to be the problem for writing the encoder, then?
thx <@U3SJEDR96> , it supports recursive parser?
Sure. It's a good old parser/combinator library that works on character-chomping with delayed commits, and has the regular "forced laziness" for defining recursive values.
Well now I'm discovering the problem may be my own incompetence here
I have hope again now
Ok perfect, thx again <@U3SJEDR96>
Any ideas?
Hm, can you show the actual code? My example up there ^ is missing the actual `yourDict |&gt; ` in front of it, so maybe that's it?
nope, you were right, for some reason I assumed you could just assign that to a function and it would leave a pipeline waiting for an initial value
Oh, you can, if you replace `|&gt;` with `&gt;&gt;` to compose the functions
hello, I am new to elm and was wondering how stable to syntax is going to be moving forward?
Things aren't set in stone, but I don't expect _huge_ changes anytime soon. Good to know: new versions of the language usually come with tooling to convert old code; both in terms of syntax as well as the core libraries changing
I want to have html links and lists embedded in a string/text block and elm-markdown seems to be a solution. However it generates a &lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt; block around my text and unfortunately the marked native implementation is not understandable for me. Did anybody so something similar in the past and knows the reason? I just want to convert the text into regular html in a div or something similar.
Your string is probably indented by 3 or more spaces
I will check that, because for simple test string it worked as expected. Give me a sec
that would be a really shameful outcome …
<@U3SJEDR96> thanks that was it. Sorry, I should have considered that… However thanks for your help, I can continue now :slightly_smiling_face:
That's really nothing to feel ashamed or sorry over - it's easy to spot once you know what to look for; but knowing what to look for is not that obvious :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U3SJEDR96> your definition of ptint works perfectly, thanks!
Can anyone help with this?  i have lots of widgets that contains loadingState and it seems such not as good solution to make definitions of changings loadingState for all of it
