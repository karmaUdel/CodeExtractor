U0Y7H2F3M : <@U37C5V3HT> why node.js only?
U37C5V3HT : Botkit's framework is based on node
U3PC7KLVC : <@U0W242TL3> Sorry!

U4BAQAQ1G : thanks team for invitation
U4BAQAQ1G : help required in Wordpress post
U4BAQAQ1G : I want to integrate Wordpress post into my slack community channel
U0V93GE5R : Amazon s3 is down, affecting Slack, everyone else seemingly <https://status.aws.amazon.com/>
U0HRQBPE1 : <@U48K69M1Q> <@U0KH7478W> Great questions and thanks for asking. Will write up some answers and share them soon. Virtual fistbump coming your way :punch::skin-tone-5:
U43E2J0FM : so, given <http://users.info|users.info> and a desired custom message:```id : U*******9
team_id : T*******7
```
How would a user go about instructing the bot to send a custom message to the above user? Can I run a webserver in the background that takes a key, id, message as instructions to send a specific message?

U3NFQN97H : jasonchan510: if you thinking of a private between the bot and user, u can use bot.api.im.open (<https://api.slack.com/methods/im.open>) then self.bot.api.chat.postMessage (<https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage>)
U46ARQJF9 : i am using slack-app in more than one sub-domain if I use add to slack from all the sub-domain then I get that all the slack-app register in the slack Team but I am chatting with my slack app then I get more than one output from the slackbot
U0XGCFPRC : hello all, I've built a custom bot using Hubot, but I'd like to package it as a Slack App, i've added a bot user to the app, but I'm unsure how to connect my bot to the Slack App? I've been through the documentation but still unsure how to proceed. any help is appreciated.
U1DM2B4SY : <!subteam^S0HMJEQ9F|@admins> Is there a way we can hide user's email addresses on this team? I just received an unsolicited email directly from <@U2W2JHCL8>, having never interacted with them, promoting their bot and seeking feedback. Given we've never communicated, I have to assume it was a mass email. I don't think that's an appropriate use of this forum or its userbase
U0V93GE5R : Agreed, i'll dm <@U2W2JHCL8>. If the emails persist, let us know.
U37C5V3HT : adambeliveau: I got it as well!
U37C5V3HT : May be we can just remove our email addresses. One can always DM for special discussion/announcement/offer/ etc.
U37C5V3HT : We did this for our slack design community, and made an announcement to all members to remove their phone numbers from privacy standpoint. And it worked!
U2W2JHCL8 : Sorry for the inconveniences <@U1DM2B4SY> and <@U37C5V3HT>.  I'm not promoting a bot, just an opensource project with no commercial intention.
I believed that one of the use of the forum was to collect feedbacks. cc: <@U0V93GE5R>

U1DM2B4SY : I'm okay with doing it in this forum, but this is the forum we've agreed to engage in those conversations. One of the selling points of slack is logically grouping like content. I don't want to jump between here and my email doing the same task. I personally would have had a much different reaction had you chosen to reach out on here, out mutually agreed upon forum for that type of discussion.
U2W2JHCL8 : <@U0V93GE5R> is it ok to DM members?
U0V93GE5R : Not unsolicited.
U0V93GE5R : If you have an existing relationship or an invitation to DM them sure!
U2W2JHCL8 : Sounds good.
U0V93GE5R : But no one wants to get a DM notification when they are trying to work with a random solicitation.
U37C5V3HT : How do you test new slack users to test a slack bot? Do you really have to create email address, send invites, and then test? :thinking_face: 
U43E2J0FM : <@U3NFQN97H> but is it safe to do this using a webserver as middleware?
U46ARQJF9 : how to create dynamic bot through slack api
U3NFQN97H : <@U43E2J0FM> it should be fine(?) I'm no expert, quite frankly i'm new to this, however I too came across similar issue and that was the solution I applied
U43E2J0FM : brilliant, would you be willing to share the code?
U3Y2UBA1E : Hey guys....sujan is here...i want to know that how to format my response message which display like there is multiple attachment which is showing same message ...
U3Y2UBA1E : Actually i am going to add message json data into array and then i send json response in slack when slash command fire
U0GT29N3A : <@U3Y2UBA1E> You can put markdown in attachments (the example you show has bold) by using `{"mrkdwn_in":["text"]}` : <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting>
U3Y2UBA1E : Ohky....thank you...actually i have  already done. But thanks again :slightly_smiling_face: :+1: 
U0KECURAT : sujanpatel: sounds like a  job for <http://www.walkiebot.co|www.walkiebot.co> ! :slightly_smiling_face:
U419E6R60 : I'm reading the Oauth documentation (<https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth>) and in the hook back to my API, I would like the profile details of the user who authenticated.  In making the request `<https://slack.com/oauth/authorize>?....` is there anyway that I can request slack to send the profile details of the authenticating user when it makes a request to my redirect hook?
U272P5K71 : <@U419E6R60>: unfortunately, you have to make an additional user info call after you get the token.
U419E6R60 : Yeah in authing when I pass `identity.*` and any other scopes I get an error message
U419E6R60 : ```Invalid permissions requested
Cannot request both identity scopes and other scopes at the same time

```

U419E6R60 : I notice this error message when I add `identity.*` scopes and other scopes when requesting a page for the user to auth:```
Invalid permissions requested
Cannot request both identity scopes and other scopes at the same time
```

U419E6R60 : this is after makign this request `<https://slack.com/oauth/authorize>?`
U419E6R60 : why can I  not request both identity scopes and other scopes?
U07CW6N3A : Unfortunately, at this time you need to perform the round trip twice -- the identity scopes are _exclusive_ in that they can only be requested on their own without other scopes. But if you go ahead in a second trip to oauth/authorize requesting the other scopes you want, they'll be added on to the existing token progressively
U419E6R60 : I've been trying to find a reason but I cannot find it
U07CW6N3A : The reason why is that Sign in with Slack is a kind of product of its own that just happens to run on the same OAuth used to install apps. That installing an app and Signing in to one are two distinct activities. It can be confusing.
U419E6R60 : i see...ok thank you <@U07CW6N3A>
U07CW6N3A : It trips enough folks up that I think it's likely you'll find that seemingly artificial separation bridged one day.
U419E6R60 : Yeah I was intuitively putting that understanding together seeing as that there is a `sign in` with slack button and `an add to slack ` button
