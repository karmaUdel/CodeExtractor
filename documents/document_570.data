U4WH8STNX : yeah it does have a lot of overhead
U4WH8STNX : well conceptual overhead that is
U4872964V : maybe not a discussion for <#C192T0Q1E|beginners> though
U4WH8STNX : sure :slightly_smiling_face:, got carried away

U0F7JPK36 : Oh no this isn't your fault, the error message for this needs to be way better than it currently is
U6FECHN3B : I have a question regarding how data is structured within Elm vs in JavaScript.if I were to pass in an array of Objects from JavaScript to Elm, is a List of Elm records equivalent enough for that to work i.e. passing from JavaScript the following:

```

U6FECHN3B : ``````

U6FECHN3B : sorry
U6FECHN3B : ```[{key: key, value: value}, {key: key, value: value}]
```

U65B9414J : I'm using Json.Decode.Pipeline . `
type alias User =
    { name : String
    , age : Int
    , githubid : Maybe String
    }


userDecoder : Decoder User
userDecoder =
    decode User
        |&gt; required "name" string
        |&gt; required "age" int
        --|&gt; optional "githubid" (nullable string) (Just "")
        |&gt; optional "githubid" (nullable string) Nothing
`

U65B9414J : commented out line works
U6FECHN3B : would that be represented in Elm as 
```
type alias itemname =
{ key: String, value: String
}
```

U65B9414J : replacing Just "" with Nothing fails. Anyone knows why.
U6FECHN3B : something according to that
U6FECHN3B : I'm looking to pass in an array of key value pairs via a port
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U65B9414J> It compiles for me. What error are you getting?
U65B9414J : <@U48AEBJQ3> The 3rd argument to function `optional` is causing a mismatch.
73|            optional "githubid" (nullable string) Nothing
                                                     ^^^^^^^
Function `optional` is expecting the 3rd argument to be:

    Maybe String

But it is:

    Msg

U65B9414J : I have pasted the whole code here <https://gist.github.com/neerajdotname/b7deadea90d42b49e0b4f41d1b5488bb>
U65B9414J : If key is missing or is null then I'm trying to get Nothing in return and not Just "".
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U6FECHN3B> Ports have to decode incoming data. Elm helps out a bit by providing automated ways to decode simple structures. If you had a port of type `port myIncomingPort : (List ItemName -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg` it should work? I usually just do `port myIncomingPort : (Value -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg` and write my own decoders.
U6FECHN3B : in this case it would be a very simple structure just of key value pairs of type String
