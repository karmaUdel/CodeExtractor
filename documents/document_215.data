U0HT1NBLH : The nice people in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> might be able to help you
U07CW6N3A : <@U3KHRQLTX> can definitely agree that it'd be a little more intuitive with that error, though looking at it from another angle, it's because a bot doesn't technically have `channels:write` as part of it's semi-compound `bot` scope... there are some methods that a bot *does* have scope for but can't actually run due to being a bot, and that error is generally reserved for that scenario instead.
U3KHRQLTX : <@U07CW6N3A> Aha! Thank you, that makes sense
U07CW6N3A : <@U3KHRQLTX> another thing to note in a collected quirks section :wink:

U3EFK8UES : Changed it to
U3EFK8UES : ```I had a wonderful experience! The rooms were *somewhat* wonderful and the staff were helpful.```
U3EFK8UES : and
U3EFK8UES : ```I had a wonderful experience! The rooms were wonderful and the staff were *somewhat* helpful.```
U3EFK8UES : Same percentage on all 3
U3LDUPV2A : interesting… did it pickup on somewhat as a key phrase?
U3EFK8UES : Nope
U3EFK8UES : Hrm, it picks up on Kind of
U3EFK8UES : but doesn't reduce the percent
U3LDUPV2A : i see… in many contexts *somewhat* would probably be a useless word… in this context, it's definitely adding something.
U3EFK8UES : ```I had a wonderful experience! The rooms were wonderful and the staff were kind of helpful.```
