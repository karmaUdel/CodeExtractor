U3YDBDP4Z : I'm not sure where they come from.
U3YDBDP4Z : I would have assumed the Navigation package but it doesn't mention them
U3YDBDP4Z : And the only other package I have is url-parser, which doesn't have them either
U3YDBDP4Z : Which is confusing, since I use them in Update.elm but they are not imported from anything
U48AEBJQ3 : If you are using them somewhere, they are either defined there or they are imported. This is a reason to not import `exposing (..)`, since it makes it more difficult to know where things come from. The navigation package doesn't define any constructors by those names.
U3YDBDP4Z : Haha, you are absolutely correct
U3YDBDP4Z : I was having a brain fart
U4872964V : <@U5FC7BE0G> `if model.something == Nothing then Cmd.none else someCmd` perhaps. If you're not interested in the actual contents of the `Just`
U5FC7BE0G : <@U4872964V> my example was actually a bit wrong. What I actually needed was this:
```
case model.something of
                Just x -&gt;
                    doSomething model.something

                Nothing -&gt;
                    Cmd.none
```

I ended up creating this helper:

```
maybeRunCmd : (a -&gt; Cmd msg) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Cmd msg
maybeRunCmd f maybe =
    maybe
        |&gt; Maybe.map f
        |&gt; Maybe.withDefault Cmd.none
```
... which works like a charm :slightly_smiling_face:

U4872964V : great
U0J8D9M2P : ```But the returned value (shown above) is a:

    { altitude : number, azimuth : number1 }
```

Why does it says `number1`?

U41NK9BM4 : IIRC it is a way to say: could be a different type than the other `number`
U41NK9BM4 : (Int vs. float  - for example)
U635238TG : i'm doing the intro guide and it had me clone over the code examples. however, i want to write these programs myself while I go along. Can I just open up an example.elm file in my text editor, write the code with the tutorial and then...what. Run elm-make to make an html file? and then I can just throw that in the browser to see if it worked?
U0J8D9M2P : you can do it with elm-reactor as well
U0J8D9M2P : which will compile elm files and serve them for you
U635238TG : i see. i guess the examples in the tutorial also happen to be in the directory i installed so I can just open up those exact files with my text editor
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U635238TG> i typically use elm reactor for every meaningful change to quickly test functionality in localhost. elm-make I save for when I'm pushing to remote repo. But I know a lot of folks use automated build tools that run elm-make on every save sometimes.
U0J8D9M2P : You can use `elm-reactor` when you working only with Elm files. If you working with custom setup, e.g. you integrate Elm into html page, then e.g. `webpack` can help with automated compilation.
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U0J8D9M2P> elm-reactor wont work with js interop right?

U60ERSLUQ : Any idea ? If I create the /usr../elm directory manually it will be deleted during installation.
U0J8D9M2P : <@U2SR9DL7Q> It can serve files but it will not automatically compile elm files into specific output file for you (which you can specify with elm-make command). So with `webpack` can handle this work.
U0J8D9M2P : <@U60ERSLUQ> it says `permission denied` are you sure you have correct rights to write into that directory?
U60ERSLUQ : I have run it as root. Permissions of /..../node_modules are 755, owner root:root.
U60ERSLUQ : I could run 'node install bower'
U0J8D9M2P : It's not recommended but have you tried to run that with `sudo` ?
U60ERSLUQ : <@U0J8D9M2P> : Same behaviour with sudo
U0J8D9M2P : <https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm> It has Troubleshooting section
U0CLDU8UB : How about not running as root?
U60ERSLUQ : <@U0J8D9M2P>: I check the troubleshooting section: npm has the latest version, npm cache is ok.
U0CLDU8UB : Anyway, here's a troubleshooting page for npm permission issues: <https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions>
U60ERSLUQ : <@U0CLDU8UB> <@U0J8D9M2P> setting npm config prefix (It was /usr) to a local non-root directory as described in <https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions> finally worked. Many thanks for your help.
U604S603Y : is there a way to decode a "naked" JSON array into an Elm List? I have a type alias "Foo" with a field "x", and I'm trying to decode an array like this:[{ x: 5}, {x: 3}]
I got it working for one "Foo" {x:5}, but not for many.

U1AN4JRFV : <@U604S603Y>: Json.Decode.list does that
U1AN4JRFV : `Json.Decode.list decodeItem`
U1AN4JRFV : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Decode#list>
U604S603Y : ah okay, I tried to call succeed (Json.Decode.list decodeItem)
U604S603Y : thank you <@U1AN4JRFV>
U3SJEDR96 : <@U2SR9DL7Q> <@U0J8D9M2P> <https://blog.ilias.xyz/elm-reactor-and-custom-html-9e7143553807> fyi :slightly_smiling_face:
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U3SJEDR96> knowledge is power :+1:
U601ELFEG : Is equality for records value equality or entity identity?
U601ELFEG : `{ item: "wheel", size: 3.5 } == { item: "wheel", size: 3.5 }`
U601ELFEG : tested it (with the correct syntax) - value equality!
U3SJEDR96 : <@U601ELFEG> everything is or should be, with a few exceptions where it's not really defined
U62KVQVD1 : Can somebody share link to some example how to properly do SPA routing with elm-bootstrap, please?
U17PWHU4D : hi all, quick question, I'm sure its been asked before, but struggling to find the right answer.  
what's the best pattern for requiring ternary values in a view?

ie.

```
    rect
            [ x "0"
            , y "0"
            , fillOpacity (model.isActive ? "1" : "0.5")   &lt;--- here
            ]
            []
```

U17PWHU4D : if i try to create the value inside the let, the compiler says i'm trying to assign a value to `if`.
U17PWHU4D : same with case.
U601ELFEG : I seem to have made the Elm go into an infinite loop by introducing a helper function
U601ELFEG : anyone will to lend a second pair of eyes?
U601ELFEG : (It's about 30 lines of example - post here? or a github gist?)
U5AR0LDQA : <@U17PWHU4D> `fillOpacity if model.isActive then "1" else "0.5"`
U601ELFEG : (I know, it says Haskell, but there is no Elm format for Slack snippets...)
U601ELFEG : So if my Html sends back a Msg of  NoHover --- it works... If it sends back NoHoverCrashes --- it hangs
U601ELFEG : and yet they look the same to me
