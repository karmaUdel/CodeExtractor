U4BMZ90T0 : I basically have a dictionary with 4 main keys, and their values lead to other keys where in turn their values are integers
U4BMZ90T0 : However when attempting to do something like `{'key': self.val1 + self.val2}` where `val1` and `val2` are both integers, I get TypeError that they must be str, not int.
U4BMZ90T0 : So can I not perform addition when setting values in a dictionary?
U0LSCQQNR : dict keys are strings
U0LSCQQNR : so I suspect its your key identification that's ht eissue
U5LNXQHN3 : Most likely you're just wrong about what val1 and val2 are. Probably they are different types
U5LNXQHN3 : Which is one reason why using a dict instead of something typesafe is a bad idea
U0LSCQQNR : what if you do 
`{'key': int(val1) + int(val2)}`?

U4BMZ90T0 : yeah I'll try that real quick
U4BMZ90T0 : Hmm I guess I'm attempting to index a string with a dict key, so something is going on in the for loop to go through the dict. let me check
U5MV460AG : Hi there, I'm trying to solve Project Euler (Moving from WebDev to Math, like that more)... In problem 10, I have to find the sum of all primes from 2 -&gt; 2 Mil... So I wrote this method:```primes = [2]

def isPrime(n):
    if(n == 2):
        return True
    for x in primes:
        if(n % x == 0):
            return False
    primes.append(n)
    return True
```
Question is "is this method correct?"

U5LNXQHN3 : no
U5LNXQHN3 : Consider what happens if you call `isPrime(8)`
U5LNXQHN3 : (Also, stylistically, you don't need the parentheses around the if statements - it's not Java[Script] :)
U2BS4M1RV : <@U0LSCQQNR> Dict keys are strings? Are other data types converted to strings when used as the key then? I've used several non-string objects as keys.
U0LSCQQNR : well, technically keys are hashes
U0LSCQQNR : string hash, I believe
U0LSCQQNR : but I was wrong
U0LSCQQNR : to be used as a dictionary key, 
&gt;To be used as a dictionary key, an object must support the hash function (e.g. through __hash__), equality comparison (e.g. through __eq__ or __cmp__), and must satisfy the correctness condition above.

U0LSCQQNR : <https://wiki.python.org/moin/DictionaryKeys>
U5NMSURAQ : <@U6DUW96PP> hi
U5NMSURAQ : shouldn't it work even if you profile the whole application that loads a module?
U5NMSURAQ : i.e. that module will be profiled too as a part of a bigger profiling...
U6DUW96PP : OK thanks. and what about sub processing ? will it profile those as well ?
U5ZPMJA06 : In other words, you can't use mutable things as dictionary keys.
U5ZPMJA06 : Strings like "Helo" and tuples like (1,2,3) are immutable. But a list is mutable, so you can't use a list as a key.
U5NMSURAQ : I'd guess that no
U0LSCQQNR : bingo
U5NMSURAQ : I mean, depending on what you mean. Time spent on waiting for a subprocess to finish is going to end up on a cProfile output
U0LSCQQNR : or basically any data structure other than tuples
U5NMSURAQ : But no detailed insight, because it's an entirely separate program.
U5NMSURAQ : and fronzensets
U6DUW96PP : yes as I thought , Thanks a lot
U5UQKCC06 : What exactly is a hash? I hear the term all the time but I'm not clear what it means.
U676NMRDK : hash = dictionary in some contexts
U5NMSURAQ : no way
U0LSCQQNR : nope
U0LSCQQNR : <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function>
U0NRYQNAZ : there are some good pycon talks on dicts
U3EEX4N78 : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66P5FMkWoVU>
U3EEX4N78 : That one has some good info on how dicts use hashes to store information
U0NRYQNAZ : <@U0EPQL3LG> loves the dict.
U6E53ESPP : ~Hi ppl, I came to barg.. ask for help _obviously_ :slightly_smiling_face:, about `wand` especially  image.crop() method, I have my nose right in the docs of this method, re-reading at least 20 times, but I can't get this, the description says `img.crop(10, 20, 50, 100)` where `Its parameters are left, top, right, bottom in order.` but what the.. that means ? top what ? it _should_ be rectangle... so I assume it can't be size of sides, obviously it should be points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), but it won't accept zero for top, left~ _During writing my question I found it could be because wand counts from one and not zero._

U1BP42MRS : Hence off by one errors! That's really frustrating
U4BMZ90T0 : What is the best way to package a python application for easy distribution to someone who may not have python
U1BP42MRS : pyinstaller if you are on the same OS
U3EEX4N78 : <http://sedimental.org/the_packaging_gradient.html#bringing_your_own_python>
U1BP42MRS : You can create a binary, effectively, that bundles in an interpreter and the dependencies
U4BMZ90T0 : I have some settings that the user can change based on their needs, should all those settings be put as `input()` to prompt a user?
U3EEX4N78 : You could have your application read a config 
U3EEX4N78 : I think it would depend on how many settings there are to change
U3EEX4N78 : Something like this <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/configparser.html>
U5VCDE5SS : does anybody have experience with AWS file uploads? my app has trello integration and when a file is uploaded, a link is written to the trello card. the problem is that these links expire, so is there a way to replace that link with something that will be re-provisioned once clicked?
U1BP42MRS : <@U4BMZ90T0> If you can I'd usually generate a default on first start if it doesn't exist, then allow that to be customized
U4BMZ90T0 : something like `self.whatever = something if something else input('blah')`
U1BP42MRS : Depends on if your people are technical or not, but yeah you could do that if the config doesn't exist
U4BMZ90T0 : So the `.exe` isn't interactive unless I use a gui like `tkinter` I believe
U5PJK7JHE : does anyone know of a simple maze generation library?
U5PJK7JHE : I can build one but I want to use prebuild so it is easier and faster
U0LSCQQNR : <https://github.com/boppreh/maze>
U5PJK7JHE : yeah saw that might use it thanks <@U0LSCQQNR>
U0EPQL3LG : whoah there
U4BMZ90T0 : Does anyone use `configparser`? Pretty sure I've asked this before, but just wondering
U29163YQH : I usually use `yaml` for configuration
U0NRYQNAZ : i've used it before. it's pretty nice. i also like yaml.
U4BMZ90T0 : I'm just trying to figure out if it's best practice to grab data for each variable with the configparser module individually like when needed, or setup something like `glob.py` and set them all at once in there
U0NRYQNAZ : configparser is ini files so if your used to microsoft world its less parity.
U4BMZ90T0 : Because it seems that when you're compiling if the object that holds all the config stuff doesn't exist and you attempt to import them into some sort of globals file you get errors
U4BMZ90T0 : so I'm trying to see what most do
U4BMZ90T0 : Like should I grab the values and set them as attributes as part of classes/objects
U4BMZ90T0 : <@U0NRYQNAZ> <@U29163YQH> are you just using `pyyaml`?
U29163YQH : yeah.
U4BMZ90T0 : so I can essentially just load in the yaml, store it in a settings variable and import the settings variable everywhere
U29163YQH : exactly. You might want to perform some check on it or put some default value but yeah that's the idea
U0NRYQNAZ : i think pyyaml is the defacto.
U29163YQH : just be careful the import is `yaml`
U4BMZ90T0 : got it.
U4BMZ90T0 : should I use the `- item` or `[item]` for a list?
U29163YQH : Personally I prefer `- item` but depend if you have a long list I guess
U4BMZ90T0 : okay wow this is insanely more simple
U4BMZ90T0 : is there a reason to maintain a globals file for any reason with the yaml
U29163YQH : depends what you want to be user configurable or not
U4BMZ90T0 : I think I'm gonna just leave the .yaml file for someone to add more items to if they want to configure it any more. I'm gonna use `tkinter` to make dropdowns to select an item from lists
U5NMSURAQ : tkinter is alright!
U5NMSURAQ : lots of people thing otherwise
U5NMSURAQ : but it's got TTK for native widgets, pygubu for visual editing of your app...
U69U49FS9 : Hello all,I want to get value of b from the dictionary mentioned below
cursor = {a: [{b: 'Oregon', c: 223, d: 35}], e: 118686L}

U0NRYQNAZ : cursor[a][0][b]?
U4BMZ90T0 : `ValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 1; 2 is required` Getting this issue currently while passing a parent class to a create a new child class. I would like to pass both the parent as well as a list to the class.
U1BP42MRS : can you provide a small code sample <@U4BMZ90T0> ?
U4BMZ90T0 : Yeah
U4BMZ90T0 : oh wait that's the wrong part
U4BMZ90T0 : one sec
U4BMZ90T0 : I was previously destroying root every time, but I'd like to just destroy the frame so it doesnt close out 4 times and open back up...
U4BMZ90T0 : and the settings one is a list
U4BMZ90T0 : well it's a dict of lists
U4BMZ90T0 : `settings['route']` is a list though as well as `settings['base_url']`
U4BMZ90T0 : I tried using `*args`
U1BP42MRS : I think your super calls are a bit weird, you probably want `super(Values, self).__init__(parent, choices)` or if your're on py3: `super().__init__(*args)`
U4BMZ90T0 : Gotcha, probably just looking at old code examples
U1BP42MRS : Not sure of your issue there though
U4BMZ90T0 : Yeah it's odd you could be right though
U4BMZ90T0 : I had super earlier actually it was working find
U4BMZ90T0 : fine now that I think about it
U1BP42MRS : I think it's how you're passing to the super though
U1BP42MRS : I think the signature is `Frame(master, ...options)` - so you may need to unpack your dict as options
U1BP42MRS : `super().__init__(parent, **options)`
U4BMZ90T0 : oh wait, I don't need to pass `self` to super... :facepalm:
U4BMZ90T0 : hmmm, still same issue
U4BMZ90T0 : turns out tkinter Frames object cant take in 3 arguments unless the 3rd is a dictionary
U1BP42MRS : I was trying to find the docs on the signature more, they are certainly lacking
U4BMZ90T0 : Yeah pretty abysmal tbh
U4BMZ90T0 : Nearly done though
U4BMZ90T0 : And another issue... How am I supposed to pass in anything to this class if it cant take more than one argument...
U1BP42MRS : What do you mean? Only the parent can't take more than one - your class can though
U63JBUJUW : are there anymore easter eggs in python than 'import this'?
U60KNBMPX : 'import this' is the surest way to a guilt trip in Python
U63JBUJUW : lol
U07JGLLKF : there's `from __future__ import braces`
U07JGLLKF : and `import antigravity`
U60KNBMPX : `from stackoverflow import quicksort`
U60KNBMPX : ^^^ best help advice you've ever seen in your entire life.
U63JBUJUW : lol xkcd one nice
U1BP42MRS : `import hello`
U6DGQTB5Z : I have a stupid question: I'm doing a tutorial on making command line apps with argparse.  I'm most comfortable working in a Jupyter notebook, though - obviously I'll need to transfer it to a script eventually, but is there a way I could like simulate user input in a Jupyter cell instead of switching back and forth between text editor and shell?
U07JGLLKF : <@U6DGQTB5Z> yup! by default `arg_parse()` just looks for the command line arguments from `sys.argv` but you can pass your own list of arguments to it
U6DGQTB5Z : Aha!  Awesome, thanks!  :slightly_smiling_face:
U0NRYQNAZ : i enjoy building cli apps with argparse but lately click has been my go to.
U07JGLLKF : click is super nice
U07JGLLKF : but i never use it unless i'm pulling in at least one other dependency
U13L8J76J : You can always vendor it
U3EEX4N78 : click is slick
U07JGLLKF : <@U13L8J76J> true true
U4JJH96TS : Hello, `HTTP GET` is giving `400` on one machine but works perfectly fine (`200`) on other machine for the same URL. Any ideas why?
U4JJH96TS : machine 1```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests
&gt;&gt;&gt; requests.get(url)
&lt;Response [400]&gt;
```
machine 2
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests
&gt;&gt;&gt; requests.get(url)
&lt;Response [200]&gt;
```

U4JJH96TS : Both use the same version of `requests`
U07JGLLKF : is there anything in the returning body of your 400?
U5VNFM6HF : Hi all,I want to write a program to get the MySQL status through the command line.
E.g The command what I am doing is 
`msqladmin -u username -p password status`
(there is no space between -p and password.)
But I don't want to provide password through the command line. But give the input as password to the command line on asking password. Like 
```
msqladmin -u username -p status

password ******

```
Is there a way to do it?

U4JJH96TS : oh, thanks <@U07JGLLKF> , just checked the returned `text` from the request. my machine's IP is blacklisted, oops
U07JGLLKF : that'd do it!
U07JGLLKF : <@U5VNFM6HF> technically `subprocess.Popen` has a `communicate` method to do this
U07JGLLKF : but after 10 years of python i still can never get any subprocess thing to handle input properly and i hate it
U07JGLLKF : ooh cool i found a handy library called `sh` that isn't awful
U07JGLLKF : <@U5VNFM6HF> you can use `sh` to easily get this result:```import sh
result = sh.mysqladmin('-h', '127.0.0.1', '-u', 'root', '-p', 'status', _in='password')
print(result.stdout)```
