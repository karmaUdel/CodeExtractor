U2Q5GJNTB : I will check that, because for simple test string it worked as expected. Give me a sec
U2Q5GJNTB : that would be a really shameful outcome …
U2Q5GJNTB : <@U3SJEDR96> thanks that was it. Sorry, I should have considered that… However thanks for your help, I can continue now :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : That's really nothing to feel ashamed or sorry over - it's easy to spot once you know what to look for; but knowing what to look for is not that obvious :slightly_smiling_face:
U1ZCL9GAX : <@U3SJEDR96> your definition of ptint works perfectly, thanks!
U27KX9MEJ : Hello! Can anyone help me with understanding of how to reduce boilerplate code of this 
 ```
changeLoadingState : WidgetState -&gt; WidgetState
changeLoadingState widgetState =
    case widgetState of
        TableState rec -&gt;
            TableState { rec | loadingState = Loading }

        ListState rec -&gt;
            ListState { rec | loadingState = Loading }

        _ -&gt;
            widgetState
 ```

I have a WidgetState union type that can be any type of widget, Any widget type contains its own state record. Some of widget records contains loadingState boolean. 
I want to change loadingState if it exists in the record without defining all of the types like condition
Can anyone help with this?  i have lots of widgets that contains loadingState and it seems such not as good solution to make definitions of changings loadingState for all of it

U27KX9MEJ : i need to find a way to write something like this ```
changeLoadingState :WidgetState -&gt; WidgetState 
changeLoadingState widgetState = 
    case widgetState of 
        ANY_TYPE_OF_WIDGET {record | loadingState : Bool} -&gt; ANY_TYPE_OF_WIDGET  {record |loadingState = Loading} 
        _ -&gt; widgetState 
```

U0JBSEGHY : Can someone show an example of how Dict.filter works? I can't get anything to compile.
U3SJEDR96 : `Dict.fromList [ ( "1", "pizza", ) ( "2", "beer" ) ] |&gt; Dict.filter (\key value -&gt; value == "pizza")`
U3SJEDR96 : (I didn't do anything with the `key` there, but the point is that you could
U27KX9MEJ : For better understanding of my problem that is how i will solve my problem in JS way```
function changeWidgetLoadingState(widgetState) {
    if (typeof widgetState.loadingState !== "undefined") {
        return widgetState.loadingState = true;
    }
    return widgetState;
}
```

U0JBSEGHY : In particular I am trying to figure out how I can get the metas value here. I want the list from metas ```Dict.fromList [("Wade",{ metas = [{ phx_ref = "9/h8FB43bsE=", payload = { online_at = "1500723777", device = "browser" } }] })]```
U3SJEDR96 : <@U27KX9MEJ> so you have a union type where the "content" is always the same?
U27KX9MEJ : no, some of my content records does not have "loadingState" bool
U3SJEDR96 : Ah. Then you'll need to be explicit about it :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : <@U0JBSEGHY> and what do you have to _do_ with those metas?
U27KX9MEJ : <@U3SJEDR96> Bad news because i have a large list of widget types ;(
U0JBSEGHY : Well each one of those Dicts inside the Meta list has details I would like to extract and show
U0JBSEGHY : But right now I just want to count how many there are. As each one is a presence state of a user. So they may have multiple presence states across different devices etc.
U0JBSEGHY : Like count attached to meta
U3SJEDR96 : <@U27KX9MEJ> Right. I would try to see if you can't structure your data better..
