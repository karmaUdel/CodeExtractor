Ah, a misplaced `)` is responsible for the confusion. Thanks for the backup!

I've been using Java since before LinkedList existed. back then, the JDK was a lot smaller and no one anticipated how Java would grow. at the time, it seemed fine!
<@U0ARSC79A>'s question was posted at 4:08am Pacific: "Hi, I'm optimizing my clojure app. Here are results from jvisualmvm. Could you tell me, when clojure.lang.util.hash is invoking? Maybe it should be cached?" /cc <@U064X3EF3>
Hash is called when using a hashed data structure (either hash map or hash set). In some cases it is cached, depends on what is being hashed.
Both keys and vals are hashed, so consider what types end up in keys and vals of hash maps
(thanks Alex — hopefully they'll see that tomorrow when they come back online!)
