U06ELU7JL : and <@U11L3KX9S> is in DND mode :simple_smile:
U06ELU7JL : I don't think it's a good launching strategy when everyone wants to kill that bot :))
U0HBN0L9M : :joy_cat: 
U0ZR7RA3C : lol
U0ZR7RA3C : :smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : it's uninstalled now
U0HBN0L9M : :dusty_stick::feelsgood: 
U0CS6NSF5 : here's the page with the “help &amp; support” and the “report this app” links: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/apps/manage/A115X15M5-asktina>
U06ELU7JL : :finnadie: :v:
U0HBN0L9M : <@U0D7LHNTX> this is cool :) 
U16RPN2UC : hi folks! I'm playing with botkit, which is super fun. but I think I misunderstand message event types. my bot is named "torgo". I'm testing him in a private slack group (not a DM). here's a message that I would expect to be a direct_mention or at least a mention, but it's coming back as ambient:
`torgo: testtorgo`

```
message { type: 'message',
  channel: 'G16QS1GRM',
  user: 'U0299G4UC',
  text: 'torgo: testtorgo',
  ts: '1462561782.000071',
  team: 'T025Q1VP7',
  event: 'ambient',
  match: [ 'testtorgo', index: 7, input: 'torgo: testtorgo' ] }
```

U0CS6NSF5 : <@U16RPN2UC>, this would probably count as a mention, because your username is linked
U0CS6NSF5 : harvey, while this might not, depending on how botkit is implemented
U16RPN2UC : yeah, I assume it's a botkit thing. I'll see what I can see in the source.
U16RPN2UC : ahh, it might be looking for an `@torgo`
U16RPN2UC : yep, that's it
U16RPN2UC : also: hi nolan, if you're the nolan I know. otherwise, ignore me nolan!
U0J283T6E : Has anyone done the maths on what happens if everyone who's writing a bot spams everyone in the channel with a direct message?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0J283T6E>: what maths?
U16C75LRE : Hi all, myself and a few buddies of mine just built a tool for collecting feedback on our bots. It is called Feedbot. I'd love some feedback, as what we have built thus far is still pretty basic. It is super simple: underneath each bot response, there is a small thumbs up or thumbs down. Link to documentation here: <https://github.com/feedbot/code-samples>
U0J283T6E : I just got a dm from <@U16PUMPQT>, seemed a tad spammy
U04S3JCH2 : sounds like good feedback for that bot team!
U04S3JCH2 : spambots will be ruthlessly banished :simple_smile:
U169EH7U4 : Hey, guys, for us webbot/botkit noobs, I created  a short, 10-minute ish video, as a reply to <@U04SM6T2H>  's  request/favor to look it over from a noob standpoint.  The vid's just on how easy and quick it is to build a bot with botkit: <http://bit.ly/1WPmyB7>
U169EH7U4 : Btw, that's our family dog, Professor --&gt; slack bot I whipped up for the vid is called professor_bot--actually professor_bot2, due to tech difficulties :stuck_out_tongue:
U17299E4S : Hey Guys ,Can anyone help me understand how to get username from slack message received in botkit?  I am receiving the message but message.user is undefined. What am i doing wrong?
U0RRCPDK9 : hey fellas! anyone has a good Sketch kit to design Slack interaction mockups? like this one the extraordinary Meekan are using : <https://twitter.com/meekanWorld>
U15AQ2T6X : random question: is there a configuration setting preventing bots from joining certain channels one of our customers is having trouble inviting the bot the the <#C04SM6TAK> channel, its the only channel they cant invite it to. I've been looking and havent found any settings that seem like they would prevent the bot from joining a channel.
U055FHACC : <@U0RRCPDK9>: it's photoshop… want it?
U0G6S4L48 : <@U055FHACC> i would like that
U055FHACC : it's a bit dated, almost from a year ago. Slack changed a little  since then, but it get's the message thru. Enjoy..
U0RDALRU0 : New post on why we designed Kip to connect across platforms :simple_smile: <https://medium.com/chat-bots/why-the-future-of-bots-will-be-multi-platform-67c503afaa7#.oy3rhrd7g>
U14TYLC94 : Hello,Has anyone been able to trigger the `im_history_changed` event?
<https://api.slack.com/events/im_history_changed>

I'm not sure what *bulk changes* are?

U0RRCPDK9 : heh. thanks <@U055FHACC> :simple_smile: you rock dude.
U07CW6N3A : <@U14TYLC94>: typically, `im_history_changed` is triggered by a team admin performing a bulk import of message data (from another service or a Slack export)
U14TYLC94 : <@U07CW6N3A>: I see. I'm trying to get the history of an IM. I've pasted a fairly large amount of text multiple times but it does not trigger.
U07CW6N3A : <@U14TYLC94>: I don't think there's a threshold-based way to trigger it from what I can tell; it's an event sent more explicitly by back-end code when a particular code path is executed that warrants it.
U14TYLC94 : Gotcha. I'm probably going to run a CRON job to get that then. ( the API doc is not very clear...)
U14TYLC94 : thanks
U11FSNKL0 : we are (counting bots) more than 2k!
U17BEF4UR : I am trying to set up a handler for the `im_marked` event by doing something like...
```
controller.on("im_marked", function(bot, message) {

}
```

This never appears to fire for me.  I've done something similar to capture the `reaction_added` event and that works fine.  Anyone have any advice here?

U17BPUG1W : Hey folks. Does anyone know if there are any typings for using Botkit with TypeScript?
U11C8V57T : <@U17BPUG1W>: Try asking in <#C0AV5N8NA>.
U11C8V57T : <@U17BEF4UR>: You should also ask your quesiton in <#C0AV5N8NA>. :simple_smile: (At least that code looks like botkit to me.)
U0GT29N3A : Meh. When posting a message with multibyte chars in username, Slack will truncate at 50 bytes and can cut in a middle of a char. Then postMessage returns `EMPTY_JSON`
U0A16QMP0 : hey folks, i've been working on a "mixpanel for bots" that lets you collect &amp; analyze metrics for your bot with very little code: <https://www.getbotmetrics.com>
U0A16QMP0 : been using it in production with my bot <http://asknestor.me|asknestor.me> for the last 10 days
U0A16QMP0 : here's what the dashboard looks like (real data)
U0ND8KMFG : dude, should've said a week ago :smile:
U0A16QMP0 : and there's a ruby &amp; node client <https://github.com/botmetrics/botmetrics-rb>
