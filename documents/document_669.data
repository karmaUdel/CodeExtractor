```
i have a variable `today = datetime.date.today()`
I would presume it needs to be a string
comma after `today }`
?
That's valid
<@U0PKTUWKH> what's the other end of the stack say?
You could try `today.isoformat()`

Yeah, on line 35
A Date object isn't valid, you need to choose a date format as a string (isoformat is a standard)
something like that?
