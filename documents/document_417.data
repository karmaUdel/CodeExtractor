```
<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Fresheyeball/elm-return/latest> is a package that can remove some of the boilerplate
Thankyou <@U153UK3FA>!!
<@U3LUC6SNS> I wasn't sure if you wanted to sequence the Cmds (which you can't do)
<@U153UK3FA>, that works fine - actually, it works beautifully!
just to be clear, there is no guarantee that your login will complete before your search request.
if they depend that ordering (implicitly passing state through the model) then they'll likely fail under different network conditions
<@U6C09T8HX> Just try to be a decent person who makes the world a bit better. I don't have a rationalization for why I do this.

I hope to get to know Elm a lot better over the coming months, partly for self-enrichment, partly in order to convince my team that Elm is a big step in the right direction for web UIs.
