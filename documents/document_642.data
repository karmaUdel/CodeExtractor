    Html.node "google-map"```
so everything looks the same as html version or rtfeldman one
Are you sure the attributes are named correctly?
it sounds like it's not able to read the api key
yes, I am sure, it's just copied from the same html `&lt;google-map api-key="..." latitude="37.790" longitude="-122.390" style="height: 400px; width: 600px;"&gt;&lt;/google-map&gt;`
That's copied from the talk?
no, this code is from my webpage where I tested it (w/o elm, within the same template where Elm is embedded)
ah, I see
“You have included the Google Maps API multiple times on this page. This may cause unexpected errors.”
so I am just disabled elm app at all, tested this html. then embedded Elm app again and converted this code to Elm
yep, but they isn't
just looking at webpack config - maybe because of HMR or something like this
I'm still not understanding what passing that generic all the way down allows for?
<@U0F7JPK36> I made it working, thanks for writing this.
what event am I looking for to capture a selected option in a drop down?
<@U1S70NKFF> “changed” is the on, but “input” should also work in most browsers
thx!
sorry, “change”
roger that
if you are talking about the &lt;select&gt; element, that is
They're special in that they are actually implemented in native code, which is why you see the generic suddenly being "swallowed". Nevertheless, they are useful in that they make sure that, at the end of the day, the `view` in your main can send out a consistent message-type, and that this can be guaranteed at compile time
