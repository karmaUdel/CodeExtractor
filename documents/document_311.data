U5V0HVAKB : ```decodeGifUrl: Decod String```
U5V0HVAKB : can you show me if I would like to do this how i have to init it
U5V0HVAKB : ``` type alias Decod = String ``` ?
U153UK3FA : <https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/json.html> provides a good introduction to how to write Json decoders
U153UK3FA : The return value of `decodeGifUrl` isn't a String value that you can use, it's a description of how to obtain that String given some JSON
U153UK3FA : In the example this function comes from (<https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/effects/http.html>) the Decoder returned from `decodeGifUrl` is passed to the HTTP request to be used to decode JSON in the Http response and obtain the url of the gif
U153UK3FA : eg. the response is this JSON <https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC&amp;tag=pizza>
U5V0HVAKB : i mean i really understand what the decoder do
U5V0HVAKB : and what return value should be
U5V0HVAKB : but i am pretty new with elm
U5V0HVAKB : and i just want to recreate this ``` 
showME: Test String
showMe= 
"hello" ```

its all about the syntax what "Test" is here

U5V0HVAKB : what it mean
U153UK3FA : ah, you're asking about type parameters
U5V0HVAKB : yes
U5V0HVAKB : :slightly_smiling_face:
U153UK3FA : eg. `List Int` is a list of ints
U153UK3FA : a good example is <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Maybe#Maybe>
U153UK3FA : ```type Maybe a
    = Just a
    | Nothing
```

U153UK3FA : the `a` in that type definition is a parameter, it can be any type
U153UK3FA : You can have a `Maybe Int` or a `Maybe String` etc.
U2FJ2D6M7 : Hello! I'm trying to output some HTML but having trouble breaking up my view. Essentially I would like an input/sentence like "This is a sentence" to be rendered like "&lt;span&gt;This&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;sentence&lt;/span&gt;" but having trouble extracting out a method and keeping the types correct. I think is probably a simple thing I'm missing, but if anyone has a spare cycle, would not mind some :eye:s.
```
renderWord word =
    span [ myStyle ] [ text word ]

renderWords sentence =
    let
        words = String.split " " sentence
    in
        List.concat (List.map renderWord words)


view model =
    div []
        [ input [ placeholder "Text to proof", onInput NewContent, myStyle ] []
        , (renderWords model.content)
        ]
```

As more experienced devs might be able to tell, I'm getting an type mismatch:

```
The argument to function `concat` is causing a mismatch. - Function `concat` is expecting the argument to be:

    List (List a)

But it is:

    List (Html msg)
```

U2FJ2D6M7 : I see why it's wrong, but I'm not sure what my option is.
U5V0HVAKB : List.concat (List.map renderWord words)
U5V0HVAKB : u are returning a list
U5V0HVAKB : oh no!
U5V0HVAKB : List.concat (List.map renderWord words)
U5V0HVAKB : your renderWord
