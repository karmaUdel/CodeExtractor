```
that should trigger your Tick process ~1000ms after a StartGame msg comes through
I know in this situation I'm expecting that Tick will only be called once after 1000ms
alright, the compiler is having a fit haha.
I say roughly because js has a error margin with setTimeout of &lt; 8ms i think…
if you can’t work it out, chuck the msg here and the community will help, according to some we’re ‘excessively’ helpful
actually that is true, last time, i needed a foldl which reduced a Result, and got 3 answers in just as many minutes
sure, incoming...
