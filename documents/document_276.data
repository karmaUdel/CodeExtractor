U5WD40ZA9 : Anyone know a great package for file uploading in elm?
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U26LR8F4H> There are a couple of paths to take, but I think that in your case, I would get rid of `type Results` and change the function to `shorten : (Result Http.Error Bitly -&gt; msg) -&gt; String -&gt; Cmd msg`
U41NK9BM4 : <@U5XHTBFS6> Why are you doing a GET?
U5XHTBFS6 : it should be a POST, that was a copy paste error :smiley:
U41NK9BM4 : OK. Makes more sense now
U5XHTBFS6 : There, fixed it. Thanks for spotting the error
U26LR8F4H : <@U48AEBJQ3> thanks, worked like a charm :slightly_smiling_face:
U2UUNG9KK : Thank you <@U41NK9BM4>
U59AF21LJ : <@U5XHTBFS6> <@U41NK9BM4> I tried and I still get None
U59AF21LJ : But it still doesn't say the Content-type is anything in the Network tab of Chrome.
U59AF21LJ : Just says:```
Accept:*/*
Accept-Encoding:gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language:en,fr-FR;q=0.8,fr;q=0.6,en-US;q=0.4,en-GB;q=0.2

```

U5XHTBFS6 : Hmmm
U41NK9BM4 : Mmm. Content-Length:0
U5XHTBFS6 : Can you post that part of the code?
U59AF21LJ : So```
save : Cmd Msg
save =
  let
    url : String
    url = "update"

    value : Encode.Value
    value =
      Encode.object
        [ ("name", Encode.string "Tom")
        , ("age", <http://Encode.int|Encode.int> 42)
        ]

    body : Http.Body
    body =
      Http.jsonBody value

    request =
      Http.request {
        method = "POST",
        headers = [
          Http.header "Content-type" "application/json"
        ],
        url = url,
        body = body,
        expect = Http.expectString,
        timeout = Nothing,
        withCredentials = True
      }
  in Http.send PostBack request
```

```
#!flask/bin/python
from flask import Flask, request, abort
import json

app = Flask(__name__, static_url_path='')
app._static_folder = '.'

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return app.send_static_file('index.html')

@app.route('/&lt;path:filename&gt;')
def serve_static(filename):
    return send_from_directory('.', filename)

@app.route('/update', methods=['POST'])
def update():
    print request.json
    if not request.json:
        abort(400)
    with open('data.json', 'w') as outfile:
        json.dump(request.json, outfile)
    return 201

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

U5XHTBFS6 : I can't find anything odd with your code =s
U5XHTBFS6 : The Content-length : 0 on the header is very odd though, but I have no idea why that could be.
U59AF21LJ : <@U5XHTBFS6> Well that's odd… Thanks for trying anyway.
U59AF21LJ : Yeah it is.
U41NK9BM4 : Is it the case: `withCredentials = True`
U41NK9BM4 : I mean, how do you pass credentials?
U59AF21LJ : <@U41NK9BM4> Tried with False it doesn't work.
U41NK9BM4 : If there's no creds, leave it False. Don't complicate things
U59AF21LJ : I also tried `body = Http.stringBody "application/json" "Test string"` but Content-length is still 0 for some reason.
