U601ELFEG : I want to code MIDI device access - so I can get SysEx. from a device
U5FU80S06 : <@U0CLDU8UB>  I cannot get it to work, probably because I'm doing something wrong. This is what I have: ```    &lt;body&gt;        &lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;script src="/_compile/src/Main.elm"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
            Elm.Main.embed(document.getElementById('app'),
                {randomInt: Math.floor(Math.random()*0x0FFFFFFF)});

            // ...

        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
``` And I also tried record-free to no avail: ```Elm.Main.embed(document.getElementById('app'),
                Math.floor(Math.random()*0x0FFFFFFF));```

U0CLDU8UB : Is your Elm code in src/Main.elm?
U0JFXEUCT : I haven’t touched MIDI yet, but would be very interested if you find any existing work
U5FU80S06 : yes, it starts there, and the rest of the elm code is all under _src_.
U5FU80S06 : Not to worry, it's not a biggie. I can always do a Debug.log...
U2LAL86AY : what's the error message?
U2GPAEU1L : Hey everyone, I was thinking _next remote meetup_, we could do a meetup targeted at people new to  Elm and managers who aren't sure that they want to use Elm.
*How many people have managers that they have been trying to convince to switch to Elm (even just for a small project/feature)?*

If there are enough people who would appreciate if we tried to convince their managers, then I think it would be well worth it for one meetup.

Please comment in the thread so we have all the comments in one place for reference.

I will post this in the general channel as well.

U5FU80S06 : <@U2LAL86AY> ```Oops! Something went wrong when starting your Elm program.
Trying to initialize the `Main` module with an unexpected flag.
I tried to convert it to an Elm value, but ran into this problem:

Expecting an Int but instead got: undefined``` I click on _Main.elm_ from _File Navigation_.

U2GPAEU1L : <@U5FFVDC4W> can I see your flags defined in Elm?
U5FU80S06 : ```main =  Html.programWithFlags 
    { init = init
    , view = view
    , update = update
    , subscriptions = subscriptions
    }``` and ```init : Int -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init jsSeed = ...```

U2GPAEU1L : Ah I see this is a reactor issue, nvm, I came in late :sweat:
U5FU80S06 : Note that I am doing `elm-make Main.elm --output elm.js`
U0CLDU8UB : Oh, you should run `elm-reactor` and then go to <http://localhost:8000/index.html>
U5FU80S06 : <@U0CLDU8UB>  That gives me a totally blank page
U0CL0AS3V : we use it at NRI via ports
U5FU80S06 : Actually I can run my original index.html (no taco) via reactor and app comes up fine (at <http://localhost:8000/index.html>) -- I just don't see the state of the model anywhere.
U3SJEDR96 : do you see a little "history" thing in the bottom right?
U0CLDU8UB : A black "tab" of sorts
U5FU80S06 : nope
U3SJEDR96 : Wait a moment
U3SJEDR96 : you compile with `elm-make Main.elm` right?
U2LAL86AY : did you checked the output file? Sometimes i use an `old output file` without realizing -&gt; (from a previous run of elm make in another directory for ex).
U3SJEDR96 : the index.html file you're using for the taco stuff, does it refer to `/_compile/src/Main.elm` or `/_compile/Main.elm`?
U5FU80S06 : `&lt;script src="/_compile/src/Main.elm"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`
U3SJEDR96 : right, so what basically happens is it's trying to find a `src/Main.elm` but (judging by your compile command) your `Main.elm` is in the same directory as your `elm-package.json`
U3SJEDR96 : so adapting that to simply `/_compile/Main.elm` should help a bunch
U5FU80S06 : I still do not see the hoped-for widgetry
U3SJEDR96 : Do you see your app at all, <@U5FU80S06>
U2LAL86AY : please show us the relevant directory structure you have: the parent of the `elm-package.json` - and the path to `Main.elm`
U2LAL86AY : i think you have
U2LAL86AY : projectDirectory  //elm-package.json
  // Main.elm

U2LAL86AY : no src?
U5FU80S06 : ```projectDirectory          src
                    elm-package.json
                    Main.elm``` and yes the app comes up and runs fine

U3SJEDR96 : right. And you place your `index.html` at the same level as `elm-package.json` and run `elm-reactor` from that same directory, correct?
U3SJEDR96 : so everything happens _within_ that `projectDirectory/src` folder
U2LAL86AY : i don't think `elm-package.json` likes to be placed in src :smile:
U5FU80S06 : yes yes, and I even deleted elm-stuff and elm.js to re-generate
U2LAL86AY : can you please put it your code on ellie? i will try it here with elm-make see what comes up.
U2LAL86AY : maybe not
U5FU80S06 : ok, shall I bump up `elm-package.json` ?
U3SJEDR96 : <@U2LAL86AY> as long as you run your `elm-*` commands from that directory and `elm-package.json` has `source-directories: ["."]` (which is the default), that should work fine
U5FU80S06 : yes that what I do, and that's what it is.
