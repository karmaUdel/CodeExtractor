U0LR6R73K : Users needs to start DM with your bot or you have no DM ID
U0KECURAT : bots can start dms through the api
U0LR6R73K : Oh? <@U0KECURAT> what endpoint?
U0KECURAT : <https://api.slack.com/methods/im.open>
U0LR6R73K : Oh thanks! That is good to know
U28S48UN7 : Hi all! I just joined because I have a lot of free time on my hands at work so I'm tinkering with building bots. I look forward to building with y'all!
U21UGU36Z : Can anyone help me with a question about responding to the slash commands / message buttons `response_url`?
U21UGU36Z : I have two POSTs going to the response_url, one which is ephemeral and one which is in_channel. The in_channel is meant to replace original, but what happens is the “ephemeral” message is sent as in_channel, and the in_channel replaces it immediately
U21UGU36Z : My action URL responds 200 immediately
U21UGU36Z : and the ephemeral message replaces original, too
U21UGU36Z : Hmmmm```
This field cannot be specified for a brand new message and must be used only in response to the execution of message button action or a slash command response. Once a response_type is set, it cannot be changed when updating the message.
```

U21UGU36Z : Does that mean I cannot POST to `response_url` with ephemeral and in_channel responses?
U21UGU36Z : I want to update the message everyone sees (it increments a count on the buttons) and send a link only to the person who clicked the button
U21UGU36Z : Okay, so yeah, you have to specify `replace_original` explicitly in at least the ephemeral message
U21UGU36Z : I did it in both just in case
U2908LWTY : Hi there, I'm having a trouble when I try to use interactive messages with a bot user, because when I press an option automatically slack bot says "Oops something went wrong". Has anyone knows whats going on?
U1116QM2Q : <@U2908LWTY> u probably need to setup your intereactive messages endpoint on your slack app
U1116QM2Q : if you are using botkit, and use the `controller.createOauthEndpoints` method
U1116QM2Q : then it will setup the interactive messages endpoint at `yourhost:3001/slack/receive`
U1116QM2Q : so you go to yourslack app menu... go to the interactive messages option and set up the endpoint there
U0HBN0L9M : are you sure that would work <@U1116QM2Q> ? I don't think it's a redirect
U0HBN0L9M : I would think you'd need to use ngrok or localtunnel to expose the endpoint
U1116QM2Q : usually when slack gives you the `something went wrong` its causet he endpoint is not set :stuck_out_tongue:
U1116QM2Q : and yes i didn't mention that detail
U0HBN0L9M : like <http://mylocaldev.localtunnel.me/slack/receive|mylocaldev.localtunnel.me/slack/receive>
U1116QM2Q : but your "host" needs to have SSL enabled
U1116QM2Q : so usually what we do
U1116QM2Q : is use either localtunnel or ngrok to setup a tunnel to your server
U0HBN0L9M : localtunnel is HTTPS
U1116QM2Q : and that handles the SSL part
U1116QM2Q : yep
U0ZCQS8QN : with localtunnel you can save a subdomain with your bot name so you don't have to keep changing it in slack: `lt --port 4115 --subdomain yourbot`
U0TGHKPEU : btw guys where can i get invites for my colleague to join this team.. i forgot the link :grin:
U28E8RWE9 : <http://dev4slack.xoxco.com|dev4slack.xoxco.com>
U28E8RWE9 : <@U0TGHKPEU>
U0TGHKPEU : <@U28E8RWE9> thanks
U1P3Q8JKV : Hey I'm writing a wee android app that wants to send an image and some summary text to slack via intent.
I was thinking that the EXTRA_TEXT would show up as the initial file comment, and the EXTRA_SUBJECT would be the upload title.

Instead, the EXTRA_TEXT is being put in the upload title field.
I can see how that makes sense, but is there any way to get it into the format I want using intents?
(Image, subject, comment)?

U1P3Q8JKV : Oh yeah.. It's not specifically for slack, but slack is one of the apps I'm testing against :slightly_smiling_face: 
U0KECURAT : <@U1P3Q8JKV> attachments have special fields for all those things yeah
U1P3Q8JKV : Carefully reading the android docs, it looks like I'm asking too much by sending EXTRA_TEXT and EXTRA_STREAM in the same intent, and recipients are just doing what they can with my weird intent :laughing: 
Thanks <@U0KECURAT>

U2908LWTY : <@U1116QM2Q>  Thanks man! I'll try that.
U2908LWTY : <@U1116QM2Q>  Yes, I'm using botkit and I went to the docs and they explain the same thing that you tell me. So really apreciate it. Thanks man
U1116QM2Q : no problem! :slightly_smiling_face:
U29GZAFCL : Hi all, I have a question about bot authorization. On my website I have a button "Add to Slack" that requests oauth authorization with 'bot' scope. Works perfectly, except when a team integration limit is reached and Slack displays `You can't authorize X because your team has reached the integration limit` error to the user.  Which is okay in general, but I would like Slack to allow user through in scenario, when the app was already added to the team previously (for example, by another user). It looks like Slack checks for team integration limit before it checks if a bot/app has already been authorized for the team. Question is: how can I avoid error message about team integration limit to the user when a bot has already been authorized before? One option is to have two steps, "Add to slack" first and then "Sign in with Slack" (without bot scope) when first one fails, but it's not good user experience.
U0M3CFEJV : <@U29GZAFCL> post in <#C0K8617D5|slack-api>
U0M3CFEJV : :slightly_smiling_face:
U29GZAFCL : oops :slightly_smiling_face: okay, will post there
U20RE7QSW : <@U29GZAFCL> are you sure? I think we're at our integration limit, but I don't get that when adding my own bot (again)
U29GZAFCL : Yes, tried it with different (free plan) teams.
U1RL6RTCY : hey, i'm building a bot with botkit in slack *
U1RL6RTCY : i'd like to make it publish
U1RL6RTCY : what's the easiest way ?
U1RL6RTCY : can someone help ?
U1GTE56R4 : a friend of mine is compiling a complete guide to the entire Bot Dev Stack ecosystem. Are your tools listed here, or did they miss anything?
<http://bit.ly/BotStackcompendium>

U1GTE56R4 : Some folks PMd me about the Bot Stack Compendium, so I'm just going to leave the full table here: <http://bit.ly/BotStackTable>
U2806KW0J : thanks mylogan for that compendium
U29PG4HNX : <@U1GTE56R4>: thanks for the compendium. You helped me in selecting a framework 
U200UBJSJ : Compendium is great. Thanks for that
U29SUUB0S : Hi, a quick question. I want a easy way of exiting a conversation with my bot. So i thought i could listen for `exit` when I start the `bot.startPrivateConversation()` but how do i remove that `controller.hears` listener after the conversation is over?
U0ND8KMFG : <@U29SUUB0S> is this what you are looking for <https://api.slack.com/events/im_close> ?
U29SUUB0S : no, not really. i just want to have a way of exiting a flow of questions.
U1116QM2Q : not sure i follow... there's the `conversation.stop` method why do you want to remove teh controller hears listener?
U0ND8KMFG : ok, so you need to know when a conversation is over. in Microsoft's Bot Framework they have similar behaviour. You can check it in GitHub and see how they do it.
U29SUUB0S : but maybe i should ask this in the <#C0HNPFAF2|botkit-conversations> channel instead... :wink:
U29SUUB0S : <@U1116QM2Q> yes, exactly. but how do i remove it
U29SUUB0S : some pseudocode ```    controller.hears(['new player (.*)'],'direct_message',function(bot, message) {        bot.startPrivateConversation(message, initConv);
    });

    var initConv = function (response, convo) {

        controller.hears(['exit'],'direct_message',function(bot, message) {
            convo.stop();
        });

        convo.on('end',function(convo) {

            if (convo.status=='completed') {
                // do ya thing
            }

            if (convo.status === 'stopped') {
                // here i want to remove the controller.hears(['exit']);
                bot.reply(_message, "okay, c u l8r")
            }

        });

        convo.ask({
            ...```

U1116QM2Q : i'm not sure if you can... remove it actually never had to do that as i don't use the `controller.hears` listeners like that
U1116QM2Q : i usully just use them as top level "conversation" or "feature" starting listeners
U1116QM2Q : that the bot always responsds to
U1116QM2Q : if you want to ask a question or wait for a player input you can use the `convo.ask` method and parse the answer of the player, and repeat the question if it doesn't fit what you want the player to answer to
U1116QM2Q : that way you don't need to setup listeners inside the conversation method
U1116QM2Q : <@U29SUUB0S>
U29SUUB0S : yes, this is how I do it today ```if (response.text.toLowerCase === 'exit') {                convo.stop();
            } else {
                askFirstParentName(response, convo);
                convo.next();
            }``` I just wanted to clean up the code a bit...

U1116QM2Q : i think the way you have it on that snippet is fine, is there a problem still?
U29SUUB0S : just that i have to have it on every question :wink:
