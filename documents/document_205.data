    WebSocket.listen model.hostname Msg``` No need to create a task to get the hostname, just initialise the app with flags instead.
Also, if <@U36C7SUAX> is using the `Navigation.program` instead of `Html.program` then the programs init function already gets a `Navigation.Location` object which the hostname could be plucked out from.
hiya. two unrelated newbie questions here
1. looking at <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Maybe> and it shows int he example for `andThen` an operator `|&gt;` . what is that operator supposed to do?
2. is type annotation not available in the REPL? also, is there a way to create multiline functions on the REPL?
