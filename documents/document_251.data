U4RR7KX45 : at the moment I'm just hard coding it on the api
U4RR7KX45 : and it's just an array of strings
U48AEBJQ3 : `Decode.list : Decoder a -&gt; Decoder (List a)` So you need to hand it a decoder for each item in the list and it will apply it across the whole list.
U4RR7KX45 : but later on, I want to use the api that returns objects:```
{"ID":1368,"title":"Thomas Manss","content":"&lt;p&gt;Decoration is just make-up for the wrinkles of the idea. &lt;\/p&gt;\n","link":"https:\/\/quotesondesign.com\/thomas-manss-2\/"}
```

U48AEBJQ3 : Then it is `Decode.field "myField" (list string)`
U48AEBJQ3 : Later on you will write a decoder for a single object and go `Decode.field "myField" (list myObjectDecoder)`
U4RR7KX45 : what does myField refer to in my case?
U4RR7KX45 : a specific field like title?
U48AEBJQ3 : A field in the JSON object. If your top-level is a list of strings, you *only* use `(list string)`
U48AEBJQ3 : Right, so in the object you gave as an example, you might have `Decode.field "ID" int`
U48AEBJQ3 : If you want to decode the entire thing:
```
Decode.map4 mkThing
    (Decode.field "ID" int)
    (Decode.field "title" string)
    (Decode.field "content" string)
    (Decode.field "link" string)
```

U4RR7KX45 : I think I have a mistake in the import too, as it says Cannot find variable Decode.field
U48AEBJQ3 : You can probably just use `field`
U4RR7KX45 : ```import Json.Decode exposing (..)```
U48AEBJQ3 : or `import Json.Decode as Decode`
U4RR7KX45 : ah ok
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U3YA74FQD> I don't know about elm-bootstrap, you might ask in <#C3U2E3JRX|elm-bootstrap>. Normally, you should use `Html.Keyed` to give the virtual dom extra information about when something is the same or different from something else.
U3YA74FQD : Yeah, I just tried it and it works
U4RR7KX45 : <@U48AEBJQ3> what should `mkThing` do?
U3YA74FQD : I'm writing a spa so I put a key on the problematic pages
U48AEBJQ3 : `mkThing : Int -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; YourFancyType`
This could be (but doesn't have to be)

`type YourFancyType = MkThing Int String String String`

U4RR7KX45 : ah so it should be a type I get it now :smile:
U4RR7KX45 : damn it's so confusing
