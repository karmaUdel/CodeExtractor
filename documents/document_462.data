U3LUC6SNS : What is the meaning of `|-` in <https://github.com/elm-tools/parser/blob/2.0.1/src/Parser/LanguageKit.elm#L252>
U3LUC6SNS : <@U601ELFEG> could you share code on your `localStorage` facility?
U4872964V : <@U3LUC6SNS> seems to be an internal function
U2LAL86AY : actually before i made a mistake - when js comes back inside subscriptions - there can only be 2 messages not more. - one is for when the decoder fails - and another for when it succeeds.
But this Succeed message will not carry just a simple value. 
It will carry an ADT - and inside, you can place whatever info you need from js.

U65GZU4MR : Hi folks, AFAIK there is a shortcut function to get property:```
.prop
-- the same as:
\a -&gt; a.prop
```

Is there a shortcut to write property? Something like this:
```
\a b -&gt; { b | prop = a }
```

U4872964V : <@U65GZU4MR> no there is no such shortcut
U5XC2FJ1Y : <@U3LUC6SNS> looks like it's defined a few lines further down
U3LUC6SNS : <@U5XC2FJ1Y> thanks, should have been more observant!
U3LUC6SNS : Is there an Elm function for determining whether a character is either in a given string or a given list of characters?
U4872964V : <@U3LUC6SNS> there is `String.contains` and there is also the `Regex` module for more advanced stuff
U3LUC6SNS : <@U4872964V> I tried ```
String.contains (toString '.') ".abc"
False : Bool
```
Unfortunately I need to check whether a character is in a string (or, alternatively, an array of characters)

U4872964V : use `String.fromChar` instead of `toString`
U4872964V : `toString '.'` will give you the string `"'.'"`
U4872964V : …many quotes there… :slightly_smiling_face:
U3LUC6SNS : Oi vey!  Still having parser issues after many changes.  I am getting this error:```
&gt; run latexList "a b\nc d"
Err { row = 1, col = 4, source = "a b\nc d", problem = BadRepeat, context = [{ row = 1, col = 1, description = "latexList" }] }
    : Result.Result Parser.Error LatexParser.Parser.LatexList
```
Note the `BadRepeat` at column 4, which is `\n`.  Relevant abbreviated code is
```
latexList : Parser LatexList
latexList =
    inContext "latexList" &lt;|
        succeed LatexList
            |= repeat zeroOrMore latex
```
where
```
latex : Parser Latex
latex =
    inContext "latex" &lt;|
        oneOf
            [ map Environment environment
            , map Macro macro
            , map DisplayMath displayMath
            , map InlineMath inlineMath
            , map Words words
            ]
```
The components of the `latexList` parser have been tested, e.g.,
```
&gt; run latex "a b\nc d"
Ok (Words { value = ["a","b"] })
    : Result.Result Parser.Error LatexParser.Parser.Latex
```

U3LUC6SNS : I am assuming (but don't know) that the parser has consumed the `\n` and so should be ready to repeat and parse some more `words`.
U3LUC6SNS : However, this issue: at `\n` could be what I am not understanding.
U62UFEG4D : Hello Elm people, can someone please explain me the meaning of `(,)` in `map2 (,) genA genB` ?
U23SA861Y : what are the types of genA and genB
U62UFEG4D : <http://Random.int|Random.int>
U23SA861Y : so map two is constructing a random tuples of ints
U62UFEG4D : why is `map3 (,) genA genB genC` not working then ?
U23SA861Y : because (,) takes two parameters
U23SA861Y : you want (,,)


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
	If Yes:
	1.Bad	2.Very bad
	If No:
	1.Good	2.Very good


How confident are you?
	1.Low
	2.Average
	3.High

Optional!
can you highlight place/word/sentence which lead to your decision
