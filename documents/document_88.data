U051SS2EU : but maybe that's old info…
U3L6TFEJF : well, that didn't work :smile:
U3L6TFEJF : talking about interning got me thinking about a great clojure talk I need to rewatch: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NUI07y1SlQ>
U3L6TFEJF : (thanks for the preview Slack….)
U1ACUMJKX : woot i just made a graphics library for clojure! if anyone interested in that kind of thing could run some of the examples, i'd be thrilled to know if they work for you or not.

U6902JG68 : <@U1ALMRBLL> Hi Josh, actually the problem was in my mac, prev I ran this func with long running async task in map,  it was like fetch 6k items and insert into db values for each one, so seems like it was running all this time consuming all available threads, that's why it didn't work, once it has finished I got my code working as expected.
U6902JG68 : The strange thing is that I ran this in REPL and I am sure I have cancelled this task, but somehow it was still running in background consuming all available threads
U15MJHWRX : hello everybody, is there a way to get the namespace of a map with uniformly namespaced keys?
U15MJHWRX : e.g. `(map-ns {:some/key :val :some/other :val ,,,}) ;; =&gt; "some")`
U071CG4QY : ```user=&gt; (map namespace [::a ::b ::c])("user" "user" "user")```

U051SS2EU : the bot is kind of weird, the original hash-map was `{::a 0 ::b 1 ::c 2}`
U6ADT74FR : can anyone let me know why this doesnt work```
(defn what-is [x]
  (cond
    (identical? x 42) "everything"
    (identical? x (* 42 42)) "everything squared"
    :else "nothing"))

(what-is (* 42 42)) ; "nothing"
```

U051SS2EU : <@U6ADT74FR> ```+user=&gt; (identical? 127 127)true
+user=&gt; (identical? 128 128)
false
```

U051SS2EU : there's a cache for the Longs, but only between -128 and 127, they aren't all cached
U051SS2EU : identical? isn't just an equality check, it checks if the data is stored in the same location on hardware
U051SS2EU : when you type in 127, clojure asks for an instance of Long, and java uses a cached set of Longs to look up the value, when you type in 128 clojure once again asks for a Long, but this time java makes a new one
U6ADT74FR : Thanks a lot, i was using the wrong function. This worked ```
(defn what-is [x]
  (cond
    (= x 42) "everything"
    (= x (* 42 42)) "everything squared"
    :else "nothing"))
```

U051SS2EU : there's also `==` for numeric equality
U051SS2EU : eg. it would match 42.0 but = will not
U6ADT74FR : Thank you for the help
U15MJHWRX : <@U071CG4QY> <@U051SS2EU> thank you, i was looking for something preferably in core that behaves kind of like `namespace` does, returning the namespace when all keys have the same, `nil` when not all keys are namespaced, and a set of namespaces when multiple. i'll write my own then :slightly_smiling_face:
