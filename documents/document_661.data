U0F01KLV6 : And are you sure it's going to be too slow? Keep in mind, on my macbook air (slow cpu) I can run through a list of 10.000 elements several thousand times per second.
U2LAL86AY : yes unthil i try it out i will not know for sure. Some stuff will be calculated on resize (mouse move) - which are a ton of events in a short time - and we will se how it performs when the chats contain lots of messages. Is not one chat - there are many in the same canvas. Just wanted to pick a good enough solution form the start.
U2LAL86AY : :beers::beers::beers::beers:
U0F01KLV6 : Try doing it the easy way first. Then optimize if that is too slow.
U0F01KLV6 : It might be that rendering the view (creating the Html) is so slow that it doesn't matter what datastructure you use.
U0F01KLV6 : I'm not saying that you shouldn't use a deque, just that you shouldn't pick a datastructure based on performance.
U0F01KLV6 : (at least initially)
U0JL9RPC4 : excepted for obvious reasons (for instance, if you need random accesses, go with `Array`)
U0JL9RPC4 : who said "premature optimization is the root of all evil."?
U0JFGGZS6 : you can always throw it behind an opaque type to limit places you'd have to change if you change the implementation later
U5YDC1YUW : Yo, so I've got an HTML structure like this:
```
&lt;div class="Quiz"&gt;
    &lt;div class="Quiz__header"&gt;
        &lt;!-- Header stuff --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="Quiz__section"&gt;
        &lt;!-- Question + answers --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="Quiz__section"&gt;
        &lt;!-- Question + answers --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="Quiz__section"&gt;
        &lt;!-- Question + answers --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="Quiz__footer"&gt;
        &lt;!-- Footer stuff --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```

U5YDC1YUW : what's the best way to dynamically generated those `Quiz__section`'s base off a list on the model?
U5YDC1YUW : currently I have something looking like this:
U5YDC1YUW : ```view : Model -&gt; Html Msg
view model =
    div [ class "Quiz" ]
        ((div [ class "Quiz__header" ] [ h3 [] [ text model.heading ] ])
            :: renderSections model
        )
```

U0EUHKVGB : `List.map viewSection model.secions`
U5YDC1YUW : but that's missing the footer section still
U0EUHKVGB : You’ll probably want to do something like this:```
let
  header = ...
  sections =  List.map viewSection model.sections
  footer = ...
in
  header :: sections ++ [ footer ]
```

U5YDC1YUW : yeah just ends up looking a bit gnarly... wondering if I shouldn't just wrap the sections in another div then the function returning a list can just be the function call to `renderSections`
U0EUHKVGB : sure, that’s a valid option
U5YDC1YUW : ```view : Model -&gt; Html Msg
view model =
    div [ class "Quiz" ]
        [ div [ class "Quiz__header" ] [ h3 [] [ text model.heading ] ]
        , div [] (renderSections model)
        , div [ class "Quiz__footer" ] []
        ]
```

U5YDC1YUW : Look's a bit nicer I think?
U0EUHKVGB : Looks great
U0EUHKVGB : That’s how I would’ve done it :slightly_smiling_face:
