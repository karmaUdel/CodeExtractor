<@U31FGNWCT> You don't actually need to decode that, Elm will do it for you
<https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html>
So I just pass it as flags without decoding?
yep
Well, that's pretty convenient!
Thank you, Ill try that.=)
Haha! Awesome! Thank you very much <@U153UK3FA>!
Hmmm... In order to use Bootstrap tooltips, you have to do some JS initialization on the DOM elements after they are created. Does Elm have a JS hook after the DOM has been created or updated?
No, Elm doesn't have lifecycle hooks
:sad_panda: : - then I'm not sure one can make use of the nice declarative tooltips in Bootstrap
I suppose you don't want to use elm-bootstrap?
well.. I didn't think I needed all that... does that have _native magic_ to get around the tooltip issue?
I have no idea, I've never used Bootstrap :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U601ELFEG> I think the packages published on <http://package.elm-lang.org|package.elm-lang.org> are not allowed to have native code. Just pure Elm
