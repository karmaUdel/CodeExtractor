```
What happens when you rename it to `some-other-conn#`?
tried that, didn't work. Trying again now just to make sure
is that a real pound sign, or some unicode nonsense?
Well the second usage of `conn#` expands properly. (in the map)
yeah, which makes me  suspect the first has some weird shenanigans
Wait, I think I found the issue
`some-other-conn# (:conn datomic#)]`
the "space" between # and ( has charcode 160
instead of 32
oh lol. :slightly_smiling_face:
hah!
unicode malarky
did you copy past some of this from a github page?
nope, I wrote it myself
no idea what happened there
well, I copied an earlier version of that code, which worked
then added that line myself
from where?
it might have picked up a character from somewhere
github
oh
weird
I just checked and none of the characters from the snippet I copy/pasted had character 160
oh well
sorry for the trouble
there is actually an open jira issue that has had some recent activity about changing how clojure handles unicode whitespaces
`char code 160 would be &amp;nbsp;`
the fun thing about this is, thats 160 is not even considered whitespace by java
oh, I guess the issue it got declined
Probably what happened is that OS X and/or Atom (the editor I am using) has some shortcut or some way to enter this type of whitespace, and it fat-fingered on the shortcut
