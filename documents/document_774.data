U0LPMPL2U : under the hood, `Json.Decode` may have some fancy stuff but you never need to deal with that
U6D1E91QV : i'm specifically looking for that fancy stuff though
U6D1E91QV : i am trying to construct a record piece by piece from results
U6D1E91QV : from a form record
U0LPMPL2U : You can do that in pure elm using the functions provided by `Json.Decode`
U6D1E91QV : there's no json involved there, i am merely trying to copy the api
U0LPMPL2U : Ah, so you have many `Result` values that you want to combine together?
U6D1E91QV : in a way -- and collect in a record
U6D1E91QV : can i paste stuff in here?
U0LPMPL2U : sure that would be helpful :slightly_smiling_face:
U6D1E91QV : ```type FieldValue raw val err
    = Empty
    | Partial raw
    | Invalid raw err
    | Valid val
```

U6D1E91QV : that's a field type for a for field, which gets updated upon input and may or may not be valid
U0LPMPL2U : OK
U6D1E91QV : ```extractField : FieldValue raw val err -&gt; Result (List err2) val
extractField =
    value &gt;&gt; Result.fromMaybe []
```

U6D1E91QV : this will turn any FieldValue into either a `val` or a list of errors
U6D1E91QV : example use```
extractUsername form username = (extractField &lt;&lt; .username)
```

U6D1E91QV : given some sort of form record with a field `username`, this will extract said value as a result
U0LPMPL2U : Where does the list of errors come from? Doesn't the `Invalid` tag only allow one error?
U6D1E91QV : (excuse the typo please)
U6D1E91QV : the list is always empty initially
U6D1E91QV : the errors collected are not on a field, but on a form level
U6D1E91QV : i mean to add additional validators that validate on a form level, e.g. can check if password1 and password2 are the same
U0LPMPL2U : hmmmm... since `extractField` only deals with a single field, shouldn't it only return a single error?
