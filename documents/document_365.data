```
So this this should work ? `Html.img [ on "load" (Json.succeed message), src "image.jpg" ] []`
<@U48AEBJQ3> <@U0K92QFST>  <@U0FP80EKB>  Thanks a lot!
<@U3DQT3ZGC> if the load event listener works as I suspect, then yes, it should work.
Ok, I'll try it, thanks!
It's interesting, I want to load 25 images and know when they're all loaded. And in JS I did this by the use of Promises. Any idea on how to do this in Elm without counting the times I get the `load` event?
I guess if the code above works, thats probably the way to keep track..
But feels a bit hacky
<@U3DQT3ZGC> if each image has some sort of unique identifier, you could add it as a tag to the message that represents an image being loaded
then in your model you can track which images have been loaded
note though that `load` doesn't always trigger, afaik
<@U0K92QFST> Ah that's nice as well
<@U3SJEDR96> Ah ok, is that the same in JS or specific to Elm?
Ok it does work indeed, now I wonder how reliable it is
Hi there, I was trying to define a function where you can pass in the field of the record that you want to update
Firstly, is that possible?
