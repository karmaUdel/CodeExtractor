It looks like the second `unwrap` does something with an int!
Whereas with the first, we know that the first argument to the function we pass in is useless.
Yes, I just wanted a sanity check that the technique is nomal Elm with no special magic.
Is the `()` syntax guaranteed to stick around?
Err.. Yes?
Hard to answer that really, but yes.
It’s as guaranteed as tuples, functions and lists.
It's an empty tuple
jfbourget: It's not compatible with advanced optimizations. Should work fine in "simple" mode though.
I know there has been some discussion on removing `()`, as you can always use `{}`. But that seem like something `elm-upgrade` would handle if that were to happen.
Thanks.
There will always be a way to represent unit, and it will be a trivial upgrade if the time comes for that, yeah.
I wonder if anyone has rolled an elm app up into a web component?
Yep

huh
does that still work, it seems to consume Signal
The concept is exactly the same today.
umm, I see no signal in core today. I was under the impression all the FRP stuff was stripped out
oh never mind those are just ports so they would be replaced with subscriptions
Yes
