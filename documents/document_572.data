Is that right?
yep, because thats the only way to successfully create the record without an age
OK, I'm going to meditate on this for a while.  Thanks very much.
do you have an existing UI for editing the thing you described -&gt; _Both the organization and person have a contact information which in turn has phone numbers... And all those fields are in one view. A person and an organization have an address._
I might have been a bit unclear, you have the Elm  Model that represents the view and all the changes I want to record. Some of those fields need to be saved to the database through different database models(Person, ContactInformation, etc..). I am wondering what is the best way to collect them thinking about the encoding, etc...
so, you could be making changes to multiple database models in one save, is that what you mean?
yes, that is what I mean
You said it in a much more concise manner :slightly_smiling_face:
Hi!  Is anyone working on a Visual Studio 2017 editor for Elm?
well, IMO it's kind of complex because it depends both on how your UI works and on what your server needs
your choices might be very different depending on if you have a REST backend, GraphQL, websockets... etc.
I assume you have some kind of REST thing if you are using Rails ?
Sorry, I missed your message. Yes, it is REST for the main part.
so do you have endpoints for things like "create a new person with also this contact info" and "change the contact info for this existing person"?
"change the person info and his or her contact info"
"change the person info and create new contact info for them" etc.
or is it like `POST /person`, `PATCH /person/1`, `PUT /person/1/contact`, etc.
I'm not maintaining that `autocomplete` package. Please see <https://github.com/sporto/elm-select> instead
oops, thanks!
it's a lot easier if you have just one endpoint for every type of update you want to make from your Elm app. Even if this means less fine-grained endpoints like `POST /person-contactinfo/1` etc. with a complex JSON payload that the server can figure out what to do with.
Is there a styletron like library for elm?
not that i'm aware of - but you can check out the`Tachions` library if you need high performance - and easy to reason about css. <http://tachyons.io/> - is not what you want - but its worth looking into it..
Yea I'm definitely thinking of just using that
if i want to command js to do something without having any argument to give it - is this how my type annotation should look like?
`printDocument: () -&gt; Cmd msg`
Yep
