U0LPMPL2U : the `logBase 10` approach works for infinity but returns `-Infinity` for 0
U60SXAF96 : Oh, I see what y'all are saying.
U60SXAF96 : Yes, you don't have to special case `0` in the `String.length &lt;&lt; toString` version.  Sorry, I thought when <@U3L8MM10T> said "Not in my version", he meant, "Not in the codebase where I will be implementing this function". I've been misreading things.
U60SXAF96 : Ignore my comments as attempts to correct errors that people weren't making. :stuck_out_tongue:
U3L8MM10T : Actually, my version is correct -- all you have to do is turn `8` sideways. :slightly_smiling_face:
U60SXAF96 : The number of digits in 1000 * 1000 is not infinity.
U60SXAF96 : There's a very finite number of digits there, thankyouverymuch. :smile:
U0LPMPL2U : ```&gt; 1000 ^ 1000
Infinity : number
```

U0LPMPL2U : this number is bigger than Elm can handle
U0LPMPL2U : The number of digits in `Infinity` is `Infinity` :smile:
U0LPMPL2U : ```&gt; (((+) 1) &lt;&lt; floor &lt;&lt; logBase 10 &lt;&lt; abs) 1000 ^ 1000
Infinity : Int
```

U3SJEDR96 : we have JS to thank for that ¯\_(?)_/¯
U5X2ZRFDF : And IEEE
U23SA861Y : be thankful it is IEEE754 compliant, because JSON is not
U3L8MM10T : Interestingly, my elm-repl (Windows10 64bit) insists I use `toFloat`: ```abs i    |&gt; toFloat
    |&gt; logBase 10
    |&gt; floor
    |&gt; (+) 1```

U0LPMPL2U : So apparently `logBase : Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float`
U0LPMPL2U : that would be why
U23SA861Y : that would make some sense
U0LPMPL2U : ```&gt; length i = abs i |&gt; logBase 10 |&gt; floor |&gt; (+) 1
&lt;function&gt; : Float -&gt; Int
```

U0LPMPL2U : this function doesn't work for decimals though:
U0LPMPL2U : ```length 3.14
1 : Int
```

U0LPMPL2U : so you may want to constrain it to only use integers
U3L8MM10T : Perhaps someone can help with the test. Do I need to import `Infinity`for `Expect.equal Infinity  (digitCount (1000^1000))` ? _Cannot find symbol "Infinity"_
U0LPMPL2U : Not sure how you can access `Infinity` directly :confused:


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
	If Yes:
	1.Bad	2.Very bad
