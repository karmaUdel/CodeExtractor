U4872964V : problem with haskell is that it's _so much_ going on in there
U2SR9DL7Q : Go... I hear good things. Mainly that it's a dream for concurrent applications.
U4872964V : you don't have to use it all of course, but if you are several people working on the product, then it's a bit of a problem
U4WH8STNX : yeah it does have a lot of overhead
U4WH8STNX : well conceptual overhead that is
U4872964V : maybe not a discussion for <#C192T0Q1E|beginners> though
U4WH8STNX : sure :slightly_smiling_face:, got carried away

U4WH8STNX : Fixed: <https://ellie-app.com/3TrzZNYf4F3a1/1>
U0F7JPK36 : Oh no this isn't your fault, the error message for this needs to be way better than it currently is
U6FECHN3B : I have a question regarding how data is structured within Elm vs in JavaScript.if I were to pass in an array of Objects from JavaScript to Elm, is a List of Elm records equivalent enough for that to work i.e. passing from JavaScript the following:

```

U6FECHN3B : ``````

U6FECHN3B : sorry
U6FECHN3B : ```[{key: key, value: value}, {key: key, value: value}]
```

U65B9414J : I'm using Json.Decode.Pipeline . `
type alias User =
    { name : String
    , age : Int
    , githubid : Maybe String
    }


userDecoder : Decoder User
userDecoder =
    decode User
        |&gt; required "name" string
        |&gt; required "age" int
        --|&gt; optional "githubid" (nullable string) (Just "")
        |&gt; optional "githubid" (nullable string) Nothing
`

U65B9414J : commented out line works
U6FECHN3B : would that be represented in Elm as 
```
type alias itemname =
{ key: String, value: String
}
```

U65B9414J : replacing Just "" with Nothing fails. Anyone knows why.
U6FECHN3B : something according to that
U6FECHN3B : I'm looking to pass in an array of key value pairs via a port
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U65B9414J> It compiles for me. What error are you getting?
