U4872964V : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gilbertkennen/bigint/1.0.1/BigInt> is also available
U6AH7SUH5 : <@U0CLDU8UB> interesting approach, but I'm afraid that library will be far too slow to be usable
U0EUHKVGB : Just a PSA for anyone who is new, <#C0K384K4Y|news-and-links> is a great place to hang out if you like to see what's happening in the world of Elm :slightly_smiling_face: Everyone is welcome to share their projects there!
U0KNG2NHH : evening, folks, let’s see who’s up
U0KNG2NHH : given ```
type Bla = A Int | B Int
valA1 = A 1
valA2 = A 2
```
is there a way for me to check whether `valA1` has been constructed with the constructor of `valA2`?

U1CE9DL9H : not generically
U1CE9DL9H : but  `Maybe.map2` or `Result.map2` do something like it
U1CE9DL9H : actually, if you're feeling hacky, you could do something with `toString`, but...
U0KNG2NHH : <@U1CE9DL9H> no `toString` please :}
U1G51S63S : is anyone have an experience with elm-form? I can't skip validation at all. found this issue <https://github.com/etaque/elm-form/issues/88> but not sure how to use it :disappointed:
U1G51S63S : so when I am using it just like `succeed Contact` I got ```[TYPE MISMATCH]The definition of `contactValidation` does not match its type annotation.
The type annotation for `contactValidation` says it is a:

    Validation () (Contact)

But the definition (shown above) is a:

    Validation () (String -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; Contact)

Hint: It looks like a function needs 5 more arguments.```

U0EUHKVGB : <@U0KNG2NHH> There is not magical way to do that in Elm.
U0EUHKVGB : You can do `toString x |&gt; String.split " " |&gt; List.head == toString y |&gt; String.split " " |&gt; List.head`
U0EUHKVGB : Or define your own functions on a as-needed basis.
U0EUHKVGB : E.g```
isA : Bla -&gt; Bool
isA bla = 
  case bla of
    A _ -&gt; True
    _ -&gt; False
```

U0KNG2NHH : <@U0EUHKVGB> understood. thanx.
U2SQV6FRT : Anyone run into an issue where calling a port in the `init` of main doesn't actually trigger a call on the JS side?
U2SQV6FRT : Seems similar to <https://github.com/elm-lang/core/issues/595> but in the reverse direction (from Elm to JS)
U2SQV6FRT : I suspect its happening before my port is subscribed to on JS. I have to defer my subscribe call because of a dependency
U2SQV6FRT : working around it by deferring the Elm app bootstrap until my dependency is available, but that isn't great
U153UK3FA : <@U2SQV6FRT> subscribe before your dependency loads and buffer the messages
U2SQV6FRT : so, move it out of the init you're saying
U153UK3FA : or you can delay the port send by having `init` use `Process.sleep` to trigger a `Msg` that gets `update` to do the send later.
U2SQV6FRT : I guess I really want to know if that is a bug or not
