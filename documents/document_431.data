<@U2BCXMGKW> … thanks. Yes in deed - seems absolutely clear now to me… was a dump question;-)
:smile:
<@U0CQ254F5> what do you exactly want to model?
its kind of a strange concept…but essentially a `SingleQuestion` or a `GroupedQuestion`
i took an initial pass at it, but it's a mess
i was hoping to use the `Config data msg` pattern in the elm-sortable-table repo
