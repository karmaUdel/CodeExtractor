I had started with a similar approach but their verification tool was not reporting errors properly.
<@U68L8RAG0> sorry, didnt see the new one.
code that ran perfectly in my Jupyter was failing.. So split it up and simplified it .
This approach looks much better then what I was doing.
This is what I originally tried but I hit memory errors.
In case anyone is interested in triggering the Google code challenge. I've been spending a lot of time searching for Python, crawlers, NLP, analytics, algorithms, etc... This is the second time it came up for me in the last 2 months.. I  was on vacation last time it came up so time ran out.
<@U6829S5NZ> I have a quick question about your example. One line 6 there is SUM of the permutation and then you are checking if it is divisible by 3. Then on line 8 your yield is the joined integer. Is this a faster way or an error?
So 33333, if added together equal 15, which in turn equals 6
so I would add all elements of list and see if that sum is % 3
^this
Not sure if that fits
Thank you.. Its funny. I never really have to deal with this type of problem.
not sure if it is faster than modulo-ing the int, that's just what came to mind
I can time it and see if it helps performance
<@U68L8RAG0>, just doing a modulo a la `if int(''.join(p)) % 3 == 0:` is a little faster, i'm guessing because the other way adds a list comprehension step. good catch
Thank you both.. <@U653RFLBD> <@U5VGKQ2SY>.. I think this should unblock me..
Thanks again! Hopefully I can get through the rest and get an interview. :smile:
yup
<@U5U4MSHC1>
whats the function of the last line of this code
i see the difference with and without it in the output is this:
Out[1]: [‘English', ‘Math', ‘Science']
What is Out[1]:
?
yea, I am happy that something out of my school math class helped. :stuck_out_tongue:
<@U6944D5GU> It sorts the dictionary based on the keys
what is Out[1]?
<@U6944D5GU>  it sorts the keys Alphabetically
May be you are using some interactive python shell like Jupyter
so the list() gets it printed automatically?
<@U6944D5GU>  What tool are you using to write/run the code anyway?
i see. so the sorted() does not really have any effect on this dictionary
<@U5U4MSHC1> <@U6829S5NZ> :taco:
`Sorted` sorts the dictionary based on the keys in increasing order since you are passing the list of keys here, here it is in alphabetical order.
yup i got it :slightly_smiling_face:!
Cool :thumbsup:
good luck. when google hires you, don't forget us little guys :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
<@U6944D5GU> to elaborate more on <@U5U4MSHC1> ‘s answer, the function `marks.keys()` returns a list of keys in the dictionary and `sorted()` returns the sorted list. Although why is there a conversion to list when it will return a list anyways?
<@U6829S5NZ> mmm good point..
idk either
Good luck,
interesting to note is that it doesn't effect your dictionary in any manner, it will return a list of sorted elements anyways. even if you pass a string to `sorted()` function but if you use the `list.sort()` function , it changes the list.
