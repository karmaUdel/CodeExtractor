U66RFDZ8F : Hello everyone, I have the following pipeline```
test a =
    a
        |&gt; required "isFailed" bool
        |&gt; required "isSuccess" bool
        |&gt; required "reasons" (list reasonDecoder)
        |&gt; required "errors" (list reasonDecoder)
        |&gt; required "successes" (list reasonDecoder)
```
This i meant to be a generic pipeline because this code is common to all responses.
What I can't seem to know how to do is add additional items to the pipeline for the other responses.
How would I go about this?

U23SA861Y : without additional information, that will be difficult to answer. It is possible that writing a "generic" pipeline like this might be the wrong abstraction.
U4872964V : <@U66RFDZ8F> so, you'd want to put more stuff after that pipeline, correct? in which case you'd just do `test yourFunction |&gt; theRestOfThePipeline` I suppose
U65B9414J : I'm using `type Msg = PlanetMsg (Result Http.Error String)` to capture http response as string. I would like to get Response object. <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-http/3.0.1/Http#Response> .  I tried a few options but nothing worked. Anyone has anything they can point me to.
U66RFDZ8F : yes <@U4872964V>
U66RFDZ8F : let me try that
U23SA861Y : it really does come in waves... <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/lukewestby/http-extra/2.0.0/Http-Extra>
U66RFDZ8F : that works <@U4872964V> didn't realize it was just a pipe lol
U65B9414J : Thanks jonf. Will give it a try.
U3SQ42JJW : Hi there :slightly_smiling_face:Is there a way to destruct a tuple on the fly in a shorter way so there would not be a need for the let block?
```
let
    ( start, stop ) =
            record.range
in
    List.range start stop
```

U6AU4N1HR : Hello, does Http.send set cookies send from server as Set-Cookie?
U3SQ42JJW : <@U6AU4N1HR>  as far as I know not automatically - because all those sends are asynchronous…
U4872964V : <@U3SQ42JJW> you can use `first` and `second`
U6AU4N1HR : <@U3SQ42JJW> hm, then i'm confused by the notice here: <https://github.com/elm-lang/cookie>
U3SQ42JJW : Right ! :smile: Totally forgot about those… but somekind I knew there was sth… Thanks :wink:
U66RFDZ8F : I see you figured it out <@U3SQ42JJW>
U3SQ42JJW : <@U6AU4N1HR> maybe I didnt got your question. I understood it like this: If one uses Http.send, the question is if the cookie for the host and path is automatically send along to the server … which isn't..
U0JFGGZS6 : you could also do `uncurry List.range record.range` I think
U4872964V : <@U0JFGGZS6> indeed
U0JFGGZS6 : but uncurry and curry always confuse me a bit looking at them... I'm used to `flip` but not these for some reason
U6AU4N1HR : <@U3SQ42JJW> yeah, i want to authenticate against django which is sending Set-Cookie in the response.. Can I set it manually in http.send?
U4872964V : yeah, they are a bit tricky, but thinking of them as operators on functions works for me
U66RFDZ8F : <@U6AU4N1HR> using custom requests, you can set your own headers
U66RFDZ8F : under the hood, I think Elm just uses `xhr` so it should take cookies from browser
U6AU4N1HR : ok thank you both
U3SJEDR96 : No, but it should be sent along.. Iff you set `withCredentials` to `True` on your request
U3SJEDR96 : You can't manually force custom cookies to be sent along, but you can ensure that cookies from a given domain are sent along using that ^
U3SJEDR96 : more info here: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials>
U3SJEDR96 : No, no headers
U3SJEDR96 : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#request> &lt;- that last entry there
U3SQ42JJW : Ah… then I was wrong.. sorry…
U3SJEDR96 : No problem; we all are, occasionally :slightly_smiling_face:
U6AU4N1HR : <@U3SJEDR96> great, thank you :slightly_smiling_face:
U0F7JPK36 : lol this is wild
U23SA861Y : I blame Baader-Meinhof
U66RFDZ8F : <@U3SJEDR96> `withCredentials` should only have an effect on `cors` requests
U3SJEDR96 : Yeah, and cookies are automatically sent on same-origin requests
U3SJEDR96 : Since cookies weren't sent, that implies it was a cross-origin request
U3SJEDR96 : Unless I'm confusing the issue here, which is super-possible because I was mostly reacting to the "setting cookie headers yourself" comment
U66RFDZ8F : ok
U66RFDZ8F : I haven't tried setting cookie headers, but just wanted to point out the possibility was there
U3SJEDR96 : That's the thing, you actually can't. Cookie headers are under exclusive control of the UA, can't be directly set through XHR. Same with `Content-Length` and a few others :slightly_smiling_face:
U5ABF3BH7 : Hi again Gilbert! When I look a the following method in
U5ABF3BH7 : ```    validateInput : Int -&gt; Int -&gt; String -&gt; Maybe String
validateInput low high =
    Validate.eager
        [Validate.ifBlank ("Please type a number from " ++ toString low ++ " to " ++ toString high ++ ".")
        , validateResult (\_ -&gt; "Entered value is not an integer.") (validateInRange low high) &lt;&lt; String.toInt
        ]```

U5ABF3BH7 : Is the result a Maybe String, or a function (String -&gt; Maybe String)?
U6E5PS83X : I started my app with this in my `index.html`:
```
var main = document.getElementById('my-elm-app');
Elm.Main.embed(main);
```

now i've got

```
var app = Elm.Main.fullscreen(localStorage.session || null);
app.ports.storeSession.subscribe(function(session) {
    localStorage.session = session;
});
window.addEventListener("storage", function(event) {
    if (event.storageArea === localStorage &amp;&amp; event.key === "session") {
        app.ports.onSessionChange.send(event.newValue);
    }
}, false);
```

Is there a way I can use session storage while still using `embed` instead of `fullscreen`?

U6E5PS83X : actually, does `embed` still return an object i can assign to `var app`?
U6E5PS83X : though i'm not sure how to pass `localStorage.session || null` to `embed`
U6E5PS83X : Aha, I've figured it out:
```
var main = document.getElementById('friday-calls');
var app = Elm.Main.embed(main, localStorage.session || null); // &lt;-- the magic

app.ports.storeSession.subscribe(function(session) {
    localStorage.session = session;
});

window.addEventListener("storage", function(event) {
    if (event.storageArea === localStorage &amp;&amp; event.key === "session") {
        app.ports.onSessionChange.send(event.newValue);
    }
}, false);
```

U5ABF3BH7 : Hi again! I have an input field, I want to show an error if the character entered is different from a digit or '-'. How can I accomplish that in Elm?
U23SA861Y : presumably you have a field in your model that has the string you want to validate
U23SA861Y : then you would need to construct a function `valid: String-&gt;Bool`
U23SA861Y : then in your view check the string and display or not display your warning
