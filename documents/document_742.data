U37HUSJ4R : no as nice then :stuck_out_tongue:
U3SJEDR96 : well it's not very nice JSON :stuck_out_tongue:
U3SJEDR96 : if you have a set of possible keys, you can use them create a `oneOf` decoder, which would be nicer
U37HUSJ4R : yeh I always know that it'll either be one of them
U3SJEDR96 : ah :smile:
U37HUSJ4R : sorry, thought I said! my bad
U3SJEDR96 : <https://ellie-app.com/3MzHwFpBZpLa1/4>
U37HUSJ4R : you sir are a very good man
U37HUSJ4R : thank you :smile:
U3SJEDR96 : Though if there really are only two possibilities... <https://ellie-app.com/3MzHwFpBZpLa1/5>
U37HUSJ4R : another interesting one, how about a list of json like so:```
{"default":[[],[855,1900],[855,1900]}
```

U37HUSJ4R : with the type
U37HUSJ4R : ```type alias Times =
    { start : Int
    , close : Int
    , message : Maybe String
    }
```

U37HUSJ4R : `openingTimes : List (Maybe Times)`
U37HUSJ4R : can you do 'keyless' decoding
U37HUSJ4R : so far I have `(Decode.field "default" (Decode.list currentTimes))` as a property of a `map`
U37HUSJ4R : and current times returns `currentTimes : Decode.Decoder (Maybe Times)`
U0LPMPL2U : that looks right. is it not working?
U0CL0AS3V : This looks like a good candidate for <https://github.com/elm-lang/error-message-catalog>
U37HUSJ4R : not sure the correct way to decode it in `currentTimes`
U3SJEDR96 : you can use `Decode.index` to get at specific indices in an array
U37HUSJ4R : interesting, so in `currentTimes` how would I loop through each index?
