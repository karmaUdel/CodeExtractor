U0DJC1V3R : that error message seems crystal clear to me /s
U0DH86UA1 : so if I do the right thing and use `msg#` instead of `msg` it works
U0DH86UA1 : So yeah. Not a bug, just a mistake on my part, coupled with an awful error message :confused:
U051HUZLD : what is the general approach to "expanding iteration"?```
(path-to-paths
  [:a]
  {:a #{:b :c}
   :b #{:d :e}})
  
;=&gt; [[:a :c]
;    [:a :b :d]
;    [:a :b :e]]```
Is this a `loop/recur` client? Or are there any alternatives?
If this is a `loop/recur` – is there any intuition for how to know how many things I need to keep track of in `loop` bindings? I seem to spend much more time on these than it should take me.

U0DH86UA1 : <@U0DJC1V3R> i just added this: <https://github.com/bhb/expound/blob/master/README.md>
U0DH86UA1 : and got this:
U0DH86UA1 : that's pretty neat...
U0DJC1V3R : that's indeed pretty cool!

U0DH86UA1 : Thanks <@U051HUZLD>
U08HJGLPQ : is there any recommended way of fixing ``` java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: clojure.tools.logging.impl.LoggerFactory```? This is happening on a fresh project created with `lean new luminus &lt;app name&gt;` (running `[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"][org.clojure/tools.logging "0.4.0"]` )
U1C03090C : <@U067DHTFF> you can consider asking in the <#C077KDE3A|luminus> channel. I'll see what I can find
U08HJGLPQ : ok, will do!
U6GFE9HS7 : <@U08HJGLPQ> I seem to remember a similar issue in one of my projects, and the solution was to AOT compile the logging implementation by adding this to my lein `project.clj`:```
  :aot [clojure.tools.logging.impl]
```

U42CK0UBU : If somebody is ever interested in using ULID:s I ported library for Clojure <https://github.com/theikkila/clj-ulid>
U5JUDH2UE : How can I check if something is not equal to one of a few things.
U5JUDH2UE : Like `(not (= % 1) (= % 2))`
U050MP39D : (not (#{a few things} thing))
U5JUDH2UE : Ah, sets, I knew there would be a simple thing I wasn't thinking of.
U5JUDH2UE : Thanks <@U050MP39D>
U050MP39D : np
U051SS2EU : you can use contains? with the set if you need to check for nil / false
U051SS2EU : (along with other non-nill non-false values)
