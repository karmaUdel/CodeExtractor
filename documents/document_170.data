```
Does that mean I cannot POST to `response_url` with ephemeral and in_channel responses?
I want to update the message everyone sees (it increments a count on the buttons) and send a link only to the person who clicked the button
Okay, so yeah, you have to specify `replace_original` explicitly in at least the ephemeral message
I did it in both just in case
Hi there, I'm having a trouble when I try to use interactive messages with a bot user, because when I press an option automatically slack bot says "Oops something went wrong". Has anyone knows whats going on?
<@U2908LWTY> u probably need to setup your intereactive messages endpoint on your slack app
if you are using botkit, and use the `controller.createOauthEndpoints` method
then it will setup the interactive messages endpoint at `yourhost:3001/slack/receive`
so you go to yourslack app menu... go to the interactive messages option and set up the endpoint there
are you sure that would work <@U1116QM2Q> ? I don't think it's a redirect
I would think you'd need to use ngrok or localtunnel to expose the endpoint
usually when slack gives you the `something went wrong` its causet he endpoint is not set :stuck_out_tongue:
and yes i didn't mention that detail
like <http://mylocaldev.localtunnel.me/slack/receive|mylocaldev.localtunnel.me/slack/receive>
but your "host" needs to have SSL enabled
so usually what we do
is use either localtunnel or ngrok to setup a tunnel to your server
localtunnel is HTTPS
and that handles the SSL part
yep
with localtunnel you can save a subdomain with your bot name so you don't have to keep changing it in slack: `lt --port 4115 --subdomain yourbot`

Oh yeah.. It's not specifically for slack, but slack is one of the apps I'm testing against :slightly_smiling_face: 
<@U1P3Q8JKV> attachments have special fields for all those things yeah
Thanks <@U0KECURAT>
<@U1116QM2Q>  Thanks man! I'll try that.
<@U1116QM2Q>  Yes, I'm using botkit and I went to the docs and they explain the same thing that you tell me. So really apreciate it. Thanks man
no problem! :slightly_smiling_face:
Hi all, I have a question about bot authorization. On my website I have a button "Add to Slack" that requests oauth authorization with 'bot' scope. Works perfectly, except when a team integration limit is reached and Slack displays `You can't authorize X because your team has reached the integration limit` error to the user.  Which is okay in general, but I would like Slack to allow user through in scenario, when the app was already added to the team previously (for example, by another user). It looks like Slack checks for team integration limit before it checks if a bot/app has already been authorized for the team. Question is: how can I avoid error message about team integration limit to the user when a bot has already been authorized before? One option is to have two steps, "Add to slack" first and then "Sign in with Slack" (without bot scope) when first one fails, but it's not good user experience.
<@U29GZAFCL> post in <#C0K8617D5|slack-api>
:slightly_smiling_face:
oops :slightly_smiling_face: okay, will post there
<@U29GZAFCL> are you sure? I think we're at our integration limit, but I don't get that when adding my own bot (again)
Yes, tried it with different (free plan) teams.
hey, i'm building a bot with botkit in slack *

Some folks PMd me about the Bot Stack Compendium, so I'm just going to leave the full table here: <http://bit.ly/BotStackTable>
thanks mylogan for that compendium
<@U1GTE56R4>: thanks for the compendium. You helped me in selecting a framework 
Compendium is great. Thanks for that
Hi, a quick question. I want a easy way of exiting a conversation with my bot. So i thought i could listen for `exit` when I start the `bot.startPrivateConversation()` but how do i remove that `controller.hears` listener after the conversation is over?
<@U29SUUB0S> is this what you are looking for <https://api.slack.com/events/im_close> ?
no, not really. i just want to have a way of exiting a flow of questions.
not sure i follow... there's the `conversation.stop` method why do you want to remove teh controller hears listener?
ok, so you need to know when a conversation is over. in Microsoft's Bot Framework they have similar behaviour. You can check it in GitHub and see how they do it.
but maybe i should ask this in the <#C0HNPFAF2|botkit-conversations> channel instead... :wink:
<@U1116QM2Q> yes, exactly. but how do i remove it
