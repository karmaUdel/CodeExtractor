U1BP42MRS : Which part?
1. Automate repetitive tasks: This should be pretty small to start, maybe you check for a stock price every day. Just do it with python instead of logging into a website

2. Small webapp: This is much bigger since you need to also know HTML and CSS

U42LCHFD2 : thats how I also got started <@U1BP42MRS>   - i still get excited about all the new ways to do things, that I learn every day lol
U5MV460AG : Will try it, If I get stuck... Well, this is why the channel was made :stuck_out_tongue:
U5NT83K1C : I'm trying to convert the categorical values to dummy numerical. but I get error. how can i fix it?
U5CRANMFV : ```  &lt;script async src="{{ site.baseurl }}/scripts/loadCSS.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  &lt;noscript&gt;
    &lt;link href="{{ site.baseurl }}/style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
  &lt;/noscript&gt;```
but if I need to add another stylesheet, how to do it?

U5LNXQHN3 : You can have as many link elements as you want
U5CRANMFV : and where do I add styles?in noscript? - it's not working.

U5LNXQHN3 : The noscript stuff only runs when there is no script. So I'm guessing that 'loadCSS.min.js' handles all your stylesheets. I'm guessing that's part of some client-side framework you're using
U5CRANMFV : In General, I can't understand how to make styles with loadcss
U5LNXQHN3 : Why are you using it?
U5CRANMFV : ```  &lt;script async src="{{ site.baseurl }}/scripts/loadCSS.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  &lt;noscript&gt;
    &lt;link href="{{ site.baseurl }}/style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
  &lt;/noscript&gt;```
this example is not correct?
Want to speed up the website and listen to `google page speed`, <@U5LNXQHN3>

U5LNXQHN3 : You need to understand how loadCSS works if you want to use it
U5CRANMFV : it true:slightly_frowning_face:
U5LNXQHN3 : The standard way to use CSS is the `&lt;link&gt;` element, as seen in the noscript section. If you have those link elements outside of the noscript, they will work
U5LNXQHN3 : I suggest getting it working properly first, and worrying about optimisation later
U3G7RJP61 : Opening a file in Python - is it relative to the file location calling the file open?
U3G7RJP61 : I'm hard coding a path for now, and have `fp = open("../../../media/images/e772778c-9002-4268-a515-b3ced6175723.png", "r")` but it isn't finding it. That file does exist though
U3G7RJP61 : Or is it best to go from the root?
U5LNXQHN3 : Opening a file is much the same in most languages - it's relative to the current working directory, which _might_ be the directory that the program lives in, but it can be anything
U5LNXQHN3 : What is quite typical is to have the program configuration specify a base directory, and for the application to find files relative to that
U5SUV9BPD : what is the best (=efficient, pythonic) way to scrape a lot of (ca. 100k) urls which are stored in a list of dicts (e. g. `[{'url': '<http://foo.com/bar|foo.com/bar>', 'category': 'moon'}, ...]` ) and return their status code? i am currently using `urllib2` library which takes about 22s for 100 urls - which would be awfully long when doing it for 100k urls.
U3G7RJP61 : Opening files is something I've done very little weirdly :smile: I'll give base directory a try though, cheers
U3G7RJP61 : `requests` is preferred over `urllib2` nowadays I think
U3G7RJP61 : <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>
U3G7RJP61 : Could also try running it async? I guess it'll be taking so long because it'll be waiting for the request to come back before moving onto the next one
U5SUV9BPD : <@U3G7RJP61> could you explain this a bit more? i am not completely clear on how to setup async code
U5SUV9BPD : <@U3G7RJP61> i have experienced issues with `requests` on multiple occasions where the url would not be opened correctly vs. `urllib2` never had this so far. thats why i have opted for the latter
U3G7RJP61 : Are you running Python 2 or 3?
U5SUV9BPD : currently 2.7
U5SUV9BPD : and on mac (if that changes anything for you)
U3G7RJP61 : Ah, I'd have suggested `asyncio` but I'm not sure if that has been back ported to 2.7, I think it got released in 3.3. I'm sure others in here might know the answer though :smile:
U3G7RJP61 : <http://stackabuse.com/python-async-await-tutorial/>
U3G7RJP61 : I've followed this before and it was pretty good. Might give you a hand on understanding a bit more. But as I say, I think it is Python 3.3 onwards
U5NMSURAQ : <@U5SUV9BPD> `grequests` is not a bad place to start
U5NMSURAQ : just try to not get banned
U5KJL4CPM : Hello. Any suggestions for a reliable package to implement token based authentication with Flask? 
U5LNXQHN3 : You might want to try <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>
U0LSCQQNR : <@U5SUV9BPD> there's a <#C5PHT9EGK|webscraping> channel :slightly_smiling_face:
U1BP42MRS : Is this flask of Django? They each have a helper to generate the urls for static assets. For flask: `url_for('static', filename='style.css')` and Django you need to load the static plugin and use their helper (it escapes me off the top of my head)
U3G7RJP61 : Anyone have experience with Stripe's API in Python?
U3G7RJP61 : Currently trying to upload a file to stripe, their example code is -
```
with open("/path/to/a/file.jpg", "r") as fp:
  stripe.FileUpload.create(
    purpose="dispute_evidence",
    file=fp
  )
```

When I run this *exact* code under Python 3.5 I get the error `UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x89 in position 0: invalid start byte`. Adding in `with open("media/image1.png", "r", encoding="ISO-8859-1") as fp:` (which I assume I don't want), the file goes through to Stripe which they throw back as error `We don't currently support that file type. Try uploading a file with one of the following mimetypes: image/jpeg, image/png` but it is a png :disappointed:

U1NSCAY6R : encoding mismatch
U3G7RJP61 : Also tried `PIL` `Image` type which didn't work.
U1NSCAY6R : you are opening it with ISO-8859-1, it wants utf-8
U1NSCAY6R : just becaues it has `.png` doesn't mean it's a valid png, meaning its mimetype wouldnt be png
U3G7RJP61 : When I pass in `encoding="utf-8"` I still get back the same error above `UnicodeDecodeError`
U5LNXQHN3 : How about "rb" instead of "r"?
U3G7RJP61 : `ValueError: binary mode doesn't take an encoding argument`
U3G7RJP61 : With `rb` ^
U5LNXQHN3 : so take the encoding argument back out
