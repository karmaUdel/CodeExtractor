Yeah, so now `curl` works perfectly. So we can assume the server side is correct.
Great.
Thanks for this part/
Can you attach the full code? Maybe the problem is not on the `save` value, but where it is used.
<@U5XHTBFS6> I guess I should trim it to a minimal example.
I'm triggering an onScroll event on a div and it only gets passed to the update ftn once the scroll event  ends.
<@U59AF21LJ> I see you reverted to using `<http://Http.post|Http.post>` with `Http.jsonBody`. Can you try again with the raw `request`?
