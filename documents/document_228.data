U0KH7478W : Final answer from Slack:&gt;&gt;&gt; I confirmed with our developers that the issue is fixed for new messages, but Interactive Buttons in messages posted with as_user = true between 6:15pm to 10:55pm PST will continue to fail.

U3Y0G664R : why does our bots conversation continue from one user to another ? if i start a thread with it and my friend continues with the next steps the bot answers him instead of keep waiting for me to reply.. anyone else had these issues ?

U45J5F2NL : Hello all!
U45J5F2NL : I am struggling to integrate slack bot with <http://recast.ai|recast.ai> using botkit, any step-wise tutorial or well-documented reference would be a great help. Thanks in advance.
U46DFLBFW : Hello <@U45J5F2NL> you can check this repository on github : <https://github.com/ouadie-lahdioui/botkit-middleware-recastai>
U45J5F2NL : Let me check, Thanks for your response :slightly_smiling_face:
U3Y0G664R : why can't my bot keep two different conversations going on with multiple users at the same time ? user 1 interrupts user 2's conversation and the other way around... common noob mistake ?
U1G2B0V60 : rainbowshrimp: Yep, take a look at botkit middleware documentation
U45MYC0HF : hi, I need to access a user's profile custom fields, but it seems like this is not available? <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/e1e07567ab22b4cf065b2bdd3ee933312531ad86/lib/Slack_web_api.js#L101> - the method `users.profile` is not available
U45MYC0HF : if I add that to the list of methods, I get this error:```

U45MYC0HF : { ok: false,  error: 'missing_scope',
  needed: 'users.profile:read',
  provided: 'identify,bot:basic' }

U3K4NT00H : I ran into several related issues as well from about 9:30PM EST until this morning at about 9:30AM.
U3H7PR52P : <@U45MYC0HF> try in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit>
U460DQGJE : Hi all, would anyone be kind enough to offer some advice on using the Shopify Python API to programmatically pull report data from a store? Many thanks, Mike
U46RRR98V : anyone know of a script that can handle merges in order after waiting for circle to build (mvn release changes the version and we have to wait for develop to get that commit after circle builds), or am I going to have to write it myself?
U3RSSPQ83 : Hello everyone, I have a bot on slack using botkit. How could I rename my bot using botkit?
U3Y0G664R : change the name in <http://api.slack.com|api.slack.com>
U3Y0G664R : why would you need to change the name more than once ? if thats the purpose i would look at their API, should be available calls for that
U46TQK06P : so weird; i couldn't login to the slack app with password; i had to magic link my way in.
U37C5V3HT : I'm back after so many days due to work..And I missed a lot of conversations while i was away. Hello Everyone! 
U37C5V3HT : I wanna continue with my botkit project where i left last time lol. I need to refresh a lot. Well, i have a question..
U37C5V3HT : Can someone tell me how do i go about telling my bot to greet all new users privately (dm) when they join my default slack channel? 
U04SM6T2H : there is a startPrivateConversation function <@U37C5V3HT>
U04SM6T2H : which you can trigger off of the user_channel_join event
U37C5V3HT : I see. So i have to use `user_channel_join` right <@U04SM6T2H> 
U37C5V3HT : And any botkit version conflict? 
U04SM6T2H : no
U1TAT1DMY : shalvah: :partyparrot:
U42B3H3NV : So far I've only been able to figure out how to update a message using BotKit's bot.replyInteractive
U3ES7AM6X : I just published a story about machine agents and deep learning aka "artificial intelligence" <https://medium.com/dronzebot/our-fears-about-machine-intelligence-make-is-less-prepared-to-face-our-future-35549863fa74#.ujao1wah1>
U3ES7AM6X : There is a big part of the article on Tay.
U0K4TM8N8 : Anyone seen a bot or app that creates a publicly accessible archive?
U4157USUU : Hi All, I have a python slackclient module question
U4157USUU : relates to this SO question: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34044690/bot-postmessage-missing-icon-and-name>
U4157USUU : basically my 'hello world' python code.. will show up fine.. as 'bot' with no user icon.. but will not show up as the '@security-bot' user with icon that I set up under 'Custom Integrations' --&gt; 'Bots'
U4157USUU : I've tried setting the 'as_user' parameter to true.. but then the message doesn't show up at all

U4157USUU : oh.. right.. slack is invite based ... okay.. I'll stop babbling now... have a good night all
U47SAG9A9 : hey team I have a bot user approved and would like to get the messages posted to a channel. how do i do it through a RTM ?  or should i go for events api ? i have a bot token approved.  but do i need to have a specific oauth token generated ?

U47SAG9A9 : i m using slackclient python SDK
