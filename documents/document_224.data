     div [ style [("color", color)] ] [ text message ] ```
its working but maybe its better to do a function ?
that return true or false?
<@U5V0HVAKB> I would put either the result in your model or convert it to a maybe type and store that.
<@U5V0HVAKB> rather one that returns `(String,String)`
<@U5XHTBFS6> what kind of error is the browser console showing?
<@U5V0HVAKB> err, nvm you need to set the field with the string value. Yeah you could probably refactor that code into something that returns a list of validation errors and then renders the list or shows ok if now validation errors are present
<@U23SA861Y> No errors. When I open the the network tab on the inspector, I can see that the request is sent, but my headers are missing from the "request headers section"
And I did a simple server that prints the headers received, and it prints the samething as the browser
just general accept, user-agent etc., but with my headers missing
if your page is served from localhost then CORS is not the issue (it would return a browser error for that either way)
