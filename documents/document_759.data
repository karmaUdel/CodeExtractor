U3R7CKQRX : Because I don't want to leak event handlers I would like to use my own listener that I can control.
U3R7CKQRX : thus I looked into the Navigation package code, opened this issue <https://github.com/elm-lang/core/issues/886>
U3R7CKQRX : ... and here I am :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : Right. So I hadn't realized that `onWindow` isn't a subscription, but a `Task Never Never` which can only (reasonably) be used in an EM
U3R7CKQRX : can you please give me a short intro to EMs or point me to some resource?
U3L8MM10T : Since `Color` is in Basics, why must I import it? I don't import `List`.
U3SJEDR96 : the implicit imports are listed here: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/>
U3L8MM10T : Thanks for solving the mystery!
U16AT5E7L : how can i call Task.perform with an Action that doesn’t takes args ?
U4872964V : <@U16AT5E7L> what’s the type of your Action?
U16AT5E7L : ```type Action
    = Init
    | Load Int
    | Press Int
    | Next
    | Prev
    | Noop
```

U4872964V : I don’t understand your problem, why do you want to call Task.perform?
U16AT5E7L : On Press is a specific key is pressed…
U4872964V : I’m sorry, I don’t understand what the problem is
U16AT5E7L : `Task.perform (always Prev) (Task.succeed Prev)`
U16AT5E7L : this works but in a wrong way
U4872964V : but why do you want to call `Task.perform`?
U4872964V : That’s for running tasks as commands
U16AT5E7L : ```                if (char == nextKeyCode) then
                    ( Model.initial
                    , Task.perform (always Next) (Task.succeed Next)
                    )
                else if (char == prevKeyCode) then
                    ( Model.initial
                    , Task.perform (always Prev) (Task.succeed Prev)
                    )
```

U4872964V : so you want to send messages to your update function from your update function?
U16AT5E7L : yes
U4872964V : why do you want to do that?
U4872964V : why don’t you just update the model directly
U16AT5E7L : because you can click the right arrow or a button
U4872964V : yes
U16AT5E7L : ok I’m getting what you are trying to say :+1:
U16AT5E7L : <@U4872964V> thanks!
U4872964V : no problem :slightly_smiling_face:
