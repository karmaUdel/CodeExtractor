U0LPMPL2U : I don't think `let`  `in` is lazy
U23SA861Y : I like how all of this discussion is necessary simply because a function with sideeffects exists.
U37HUSJ4R : is there an online tool where you can see the compiled JS elm creates?
U37HUSJ4R : something like <https://lebab.io/try-it>
U4F64AKQV : <@U37HUSJ4R> Not that I know of, but I will usually compile with elm-make and then look at the JS output in my text editor when I need to do that.
U0EUHKVGB : There was something that luke hadmade a while ago to do just that.
U0EUHKVGB : <@U37HUSJ4R> There is this documentation that I started writing to cover some of the info required: <https://github.com/eeue56/elm-ffi/tree/master/docs#elm-compiled-documentation>
U3KSN5MAL : what was that library for checking an old model against the new model and discarding anything that doesn't match?
U3KSN5MAL : oh, is it elm-validate?
U5Q42DDMJ : Is it possible to combine union types and extensible records?
U5Q42DDMJ : Here are my types:```
type alias Entity a =
    { a | uuid : String }


type ApiState a
    = Saved a
    | Saving a Bool
```

U5Q42DDMJ : I can write something like that then : ```
type alias ApiEntity a =
    ApiState (Entity a)
```

U5Q42DDMJ : but I get errors such as ```Hint: Looks like a record is missing the `uuid` field.```
U3SJEDR96 : I think that should work, yes
U3SJEDR96 : <https://ellie-app.com/3BzRvvyshnya1/0>
U5Q42DDMJ : yes it works but not in every case
U5Q42DDMJ : I'll try to reduce my problem to a simple example I can share
U3SJEDR96 : In every case where you actually _have_  a uuid field, that should work. If you can share something that doesn't, I'm sure we can help figure out what goes wrong :slightly_smiling_face:
U5Q42DDMJ : it's when I try to use type constructor like Saved on an Entity for instance
U5Q42DDMJ : bu yes I'm working on a small example
U0CLDU8UB : Maybe this is the problematic situation? <https://ellie-app.com/3BzWtRXHTdJa1/0>
