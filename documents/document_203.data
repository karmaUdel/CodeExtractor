trying to avoid making code edits to slack client
if you're in control of creating slack api client
and you can pass opts.retryConfig = 0
that might prevent retries
what's the format of `SLACK_CLIENT_OPTIONS` ?
JSON?
I am using `[GET] chat.postMessage` API to post an _interactive message_ which has 5 attachments. 4 of these attachments have 2 interactive menus each, and the last attachment is an interactive button (which is carrying a slightly large stringified context as its action-value). I get a ‘JSON parse error' as response if I use all the attachments. Are there any known *limitations* (size / number) to what `chat.postMessage` could handle. Reason i ask that is because when i send any 3 interactive menu attachments, the post goes thru fine, when i send the button with large stringified context as its action-value alone, the post goes thru fine. But any other combination doesn't go thru and keeps coming back with this `JSON parse error` message. Any pointers will be appreciated
It's not documented but in our experience the maximum payload size is 8kb total
thanks <@U0GT29N3A> for your reply, let me think of alternates to work around that
phillyhacks: The client is available at `robot.adapter.client`

Hi all! I am the founder of a VC-funded startup that is looking to hire devs to assist in the build of a Slackbot using Howdy. Would be great to connect to anyone interested!
How do I use a variable to inform another message in Botkit studio?

I'm trying to reference a bot-uploaded file (an image) in an attachment message, but can't seem to get it working. You can't make a url public as a bot, and referencing the permalink as the image_url is a no-op
The file/image needs to be shared into a public channel during the initial upload, then you can reference the  `url_private_download` in your attachment.
*Reminder* You can _never_ contact anyone on this slack with an unsolicited DM or email of any kind. Please respect our users privacy! If someone has contacted you, DM their info and I will pass this information along to them personally.
Access to email addresses in profiles has been disabled.
thank you!
Please don't post that kind of thing in general <@U0LLUCLP3>
There are 5200 people here, your unexplained self-tweet is not helpful to people joining the community.
hey all, does anyone have experience with `chat.postMessage` by channel name not working because of `channel_not_found` inexplicably (channel does exist, API call worked yesterday but doesn't today, posting to other channels by name does indeed work)?
you can check if that channel id is found in the botkit storage when you call controller.storage.teams.get. I was getting this error when botkit coulnd't find the team info
<@U0706A8RE> i've always needed to use channel ID rather than channel name when using `chat.postMessage` but maybe it depends on the method?
also :point_right: <#C0K8617D5|slack-api> is probably a better place for this convo
thanks, I'll go there..there are &gt;350 channels so I never would have found that
we'll clean those up here soon! :slightly_smiling_face:
Currently, I am trying to integrate JIRA with Slack using Python. I have a problem. When I enter 3/4 slash commands per second, it takes quite a long time. It seems that it is working sequentially. How to fasten it up? Which Python library shall I use?
I would be pleased to see some of you joining Aventus Slack team. Aventus is a fair, secure, and transparent blockchain-based event ticketing solution that practically eliminates fraud and unregulated touting. You can join and say hello after visiting this link: <https://slack.aventus.io/> I hope to see you there
<@U0K7U9LUC> please limit the amount of promotional posts you send to <#C04SM6TAK|general>. Feel free to post in <#C0JQ4TX7Z|announcements> or in a personal channel like <#C5KP91HKM|aventus>
<@U0V93GE5R> please apologize.
How can I run a google script from my slack app?
I'm using botkit as my framework (so it's in Node.js)
<@U35PF1DB5>: We found the easiest way to tie into Sheets was their NPM (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/googleapis>), but your use case could be different.
What solutions are people using for choosing conversational paths - let's say you have something simple - 3 possible conversations that could be started by a user… then those branch off obviously. Is anyone doing something like RiveScript or AIML? If so, how are you integrating it?
Or… is it a lot of conditional logic? if.. if… if…
Have you considered indexing the JIRA content yourself? Maybe even dumping it to something like elastic?
<@U5GSX4F8F> oh man that takes me back. I did a lot of fiddling with AIML way back in the day but it's just so clunky.
<@U11H2RMTR> ya as soon as I saw XML I kind of thought “well… lets just keep this as a backup”
I've been reading this:
<https://chatbotslife.com/ultimate-guide-to-leveraging-nlp-machine-learning-for-you-chatbot-531ff2dd870c>
Nice! looks meaty
I came from the interactive fiction community and so I've built a couple things on top of twine, for instance
This is more along the lines of what I was looking for. Its really explaining what I was having a hard time with - how do I model and match the chats to responses.
it's a tough question for sure
sounds like you would be looking to have the bot backend call a google api, so if you're in node, whatever way you would normally approach calling an api. do that.
For anyone using Amazon Lex, what's the standard way of handling “greetings”. For example, Hi, Hello, etc. Do people create greeting intents? Curious if I'm missing something.
matthew: look through all of these before rolling almost any intent on your own — there's a lot there (edit: this is still a useful list, but I forgot how limited Lex on its own right now, can't use Standard Built-Ins from Alexa): <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/howitworks-builtins.html#howitworks-builtins-intents>
Thanks for this!
is there any chatbot for websites
<@U2ST09C5V> there are a few tools like this: <https://botsify.com/>
And there have been some neat demos of 'hybrid' apps which seem pretty appealing in the support space: <https://chatbotsmagazine.com/keep-humans-in-the-loop-with-botkit-wordhop-bd295bec5cf9>
Everyone: What do you think about pruning some channels? I think unused channels are easy enough to ignore but I've heard some complaints that it makes it hard to find relevant channels.
It is my first day today, when I saw 355 channels I sighed with relief my 23 are nothing in comparison with that...but I really didn't want to look :wink:
peterswimm: Are there any channels set to be joined by default? I don't know how others feel about this, but I find it tedious to have to always subscribe to all channels every time I join a new Slack group, so it's nice to be automatically added at least to a few of the bigger ones.    
Only general -that's why we are so strict about posting in it 
Wouldn't be crazy to pin a channel directory (for at least most active) in <#C04SM6TAK|general>
I usually recommend sorting by headcount to new members 
That's kind of our idea of <@U3NTT2Z3K> but also not bad idea to make some pinned posts. 
Could someone please recommend an easy to use and FREE chatbot platform for beginners?
We have been playing with <http://motion.ai|motion.ai> but when we wanted to deploy on SMS it asked to pay. Have just tweeted at CEO and they said it is not their cost, but telecoms. Sadly, teens don't use Facebook (otherwise we could have used Chatfuel), nor do they use Slack that often
This is to teach teenagers btw :slightly_smiling_face:
elena_sinel: How about making a Twitter bot and interacting through DMs?
Interesting! How do you do that, please <@U0AQ8GPGR> :slightly_smiling_face:
Do you have a link to a good tutorial?
elena_sinel: Check out <https://botwiki.org/tutorials/twitterbots/>
Sadly you probably won't get a free SMS bot
Maybe you can talk to a provider and get some free credits 
<@U0AQ8GPGR> you are a genius - thank youuuu :slightly_smiling_face:
peterswimm: I have just asked <http://motion.ai|motion.ai> and their said no :disappointed: I think they would need to bear the cost
It's super simple to use node.js and the Twit module, if you can host the bot on something like DigitalOcean. If you need something simple and with less setup required, there's Glitch, but it has some limitations: <https://glitch.com/edit/#!/twitterbot-autorespond> 
We are going to try and work out Twitter and if it gets too complicated, we will stick with Chatfuel and dreaded Facebook
Have they not invented one for Instagram? Whatsapp? :no_mouth:
My pleasure :simple_smile: Let me know what kind of a setup you need and I can provide more guidance.
Ah! I have just noticed Chatfuel does Whatsapp :slightly_smiling_face:
<https://chatfuel.com/platforms>
you can use Twilio SMS for free for
a little while
they give you $20 credit
so that is a LOT of free sms
at 0.0075/per
fwiw
And there is a Botkit+Twilio branch :slightly_smiling_face:
<https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/734>
Thank you so much <@U04SM6T2H> - will study the link :slightly_smiling_face:
Hi guys, I have been working on a lightweight django bot framework that currently integrates with Slack and <http://api.ai|api.ai>. Check it out :slightly_smiling_face: <https://github.com/shaileshahuja/django-bot>
hello...I've been working with botkit and it's been great. I am new to it however and I'm not seeing documentation on conversations...specifically I'm trying to gather multiple pieces of information from the user and then use that info. I looked at the "pizza" example in the examples and it seems to be in line with what I need, but it's not clear how that information is used. How is the pizza ordered once we get that info? Where does it go? Sorry if that's a lot! Thanks!
andyg555: Hey Andy, the response from the user is in the “response” parameter of the callback function. Check out the <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> for botkit specific questions

chrisb_blueprinted: Hi Chris, did you get any help with this, or work out how to solve it? I'm having exactly the same issue with google app script too. cheers, Lisa
so my question is, is there any way to disable/enable it based on environment? :thinking_face:
I've been using botkit-mock for unit testing
Which has been working really well for me
<https://github.com/gratifychat/botkit-mock>
Re: development, I don't have a great pattern there, but basically I have one key for prod and one key for development so I can run them both at once, and I only invite my dev bot to a special channel. Otherwise it is running the standard botkit setup.
And I will often turn off all but the skills I'm actively working on
I see. thanks. will look into botkit-mock :thumbsup:
Anyone aware of any tools to use with BotKit that can help create and manage bot responses?  Example: responses to _Hello_ would be hi, howdy, hey, yo...
script-kiddie: <https://studio.botkit.ai/docs>
I was running through <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack> and got `OAuth Error: redirect_uri did not match any configured URIs.` at `<https://myteam.slack.com/oauth?client_id=2153311854.193742711073&amp;state=botkit&amp;scope=bot&amp;team=1>` when trying to perform the step where I open up the bot at `<http://localhost:3000/login>` and hit Log In. Any pointers, even if to a better place for asking tech questions or running into issues :wink:
Thanks!  Took a quick look and the scripts capability seems to be what I was looking for but cant figure out how it would work with 3rd party NLP engines. Am I missing something or should I keep looking?
I've seen some people using <http://API.AI|API.AI> for NLP but haven't dug into that yet.
<@U5MCLC8SC> are you hosting the bot locally ? Sounds like your endpoints are not accessible from the outside world. Try using ngrok or localtunnel (or run it on glitch!)
<https://api.slack.com/methods/api.test/test>
You will definitely find something new. Enjoy:v:
glebl: this is awesome! thank you
We are going to start some spring cleaning! If your channel is public but dead for over a year, we will archive it. We want to cut down on confusion for new users, but still keep relevant info for our regular members.
If you have any questions, ask <@U04S3JCH2> or myself

Ok, more n00b questions. Where does one typically put application logic in botkit? i wanted to make a new application.js sitting next to bot.js but don't understand require and the controller situation well enough to know how that file should be set up
Different issue, when I try and access controller.api.* in a skill, the application errors out `TypeError: Cannot read property 'channels' of undefined` … does controller.api need to be initialized or included somehow?
Anyone can help me? I'm trying to follow the <https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Ruby-Onboarding-Tutorial>, but it's always return NoMethodError at /events
Guys we are using "Sign in with Slack" and recently we found that Slack is doing authorisation ceremony every time, new user or returning user.
I that's happing for other bots/apps too ? Is this due to recent changes in oauth flow ?
Hi, can anyone help me with setting up Hubot.
unandipati: try <#C0J3B9M26|platform-hubot>
<@U07CW6N3A> Could you please take a look at <@U5M16RYPN>'s message above and help out. Thanks.
<@U57TB4BMH> <@U5M16RYPN>  We're still working out some kinks in our OAuth flow for sign in with Slack -- though it's possible the absolutely-zero-clicks variant might not make a reappearance.  Best way to direct feedback or report buggy behavior on this is to reach out to our support team directly with `/feedback` or <https://tinyspeck.slack.com/help/requests/new>
<@U5C3P8PGT> where'd that come from?

zerocool: my company happens to do just that!  We're in private beta right now, but I'd love to hear about your use case and can send you a demo video and invite.  don't want to be spammy in <#C04SM6TAK|general>, but if you (or anyone) wants to DM a followup I'll shoot you the deets.
Hi, does anyone know of a easy way to grab a user's information (like first or full name) with only a slash command?
<@U5SL9NDRB> you'd need to use the web API in conjunction with your slash command to retrieve that kind of extended information. Most commonly, folks either have a bot user and use that token, or you ask for the `users:read` scope and use the user token you receive during installation to occasionally poll `users.list` and keep the maps in memory OR look up on demand by user ID with `<http://users.info|users.info>`.
Yeah, I was trying to do that as well but I keep messing up somewhere and everything is always undefined. I don't suppose you know of a readily available example of such an API call?
