U1TDW0L1Y : Hey <@U16USBQBH>  can you DM more about?
U1TMT1R1C : Hi!, im traying to make some "interactive messages" to do one or two process more easiest, but im having problems with the buttons. I made my app and a bot inside it... (i made an external bot too just for use it like an alternative). I setup the app with the links required but, after a lot of hours wasted, i cant get the interactive messages working. I was looking for video tutorials but i couldnt find anything.
U1TMT1R1C : There isnt a video or something like that with buttons, only to use or create bots.
U04SM6T2H : <@U1TMT1R1C>: are you using botkit?
U04SM6T2H : If so, check out <#C0AV5N8NA> for a few recent examples of working with interactive messages
U1TMT1R1C : Yes, im building the external bot with botkit. I downloaded one or two files with button examples but i cant get it works. Maybe im forgetting something or i dont understood how to deploy it
U04SM6T2H : have you configured your slack app to send the callbacks to the publicly available endpoint?
U04SM6T2H : IE you have some <http://___.com/slack/receive|___.com/slack/receive> url
U04SM6T2H : set up inside slack's app config
U1TMT1R1C : Ammm... i guess not. Where i can configure it?. I read about an redirect url and the url for the messages, but i didnt read about the receive
U1116QM2Q : <@U1TMT1R1C>: if you're using botkit's example named `slackbutton_bot_interactivemsg.js` and if you use the botkit's pre-defined and default express server... when they call the following method:
``` controller.setupWebserver(process.env.port,function(err,webserver) {
  controller.createWebhookEndpoints(controller.webserver);

  controller.createOauthEndpoints(controller.webserver,function(err,req,res) {
    if (err) {
      res.status(500).send('ERROR: ' + err);
    } else {
      res.send('Success!');
    }
  });
});  ```

Then it will auto-configure the endpoint for the interactive messages callback to be wherever your host your app plus `/slack/receive`

So let's see this.. if i were to be running that example on localhost using a tunnel like ngrok

then the url i would put there would be something like this:

`<https://my-ngrok-address.io/slack/receive>`

U1116QM2Q : cause the method that botkit has `createOauthEndpoints` sets up the interactive messages callback to that `/slack/receive` endpoint
U1TMT1R1C : Yes, im using it, but when i try to deploy the bot, there are a lot of errors in the code. Sorry, im new in this platform and there's some things that im dont understand yet. I installed Node, installed npm and all of that, but for any reason i cant deploy the example. Maybe after get it works i could get finish my work
U1116QM2Q : what kind of errors?  how are you running the example?
U1116QM2Q : usuallly u would install node and npm like u did... u either install botkit via npm or clone the git repo, then u cd into that directory (assuming u cloned the repo to have the examples) and into the examples folder, u do npm install to install all the dependencies. After that as it says on the example :```` # RUN THE APP:
  Create a Slack app. Make sure to configure the bot user!
    -&gt; <https://api.slack.com/applications/new>
    -&gt; Add the Redirect URI: <http://localhost:3000/oauth>
  Run your bot from the command line:
    clientId=&lt;my client id&gt; clientSecret=&lt;my client secret&gt; port=3000 node slackbutton_bot_interactivemsg.js```

U1116QM2Q : u would run it as  `clientd=&lt;yourAppId&gt; clientSecret=&lt;yourAppSecret&gt; port=&lt;3000 or another port u want&gt; node slackbutton_bot_interactivemsg.js`
U1TMT1R1C : Some errors with the environment variables, but i could fix it. Now im stuck in the "login" step. In the code says that i have to enter into login page stored in the localhost.
My console printed this

U1TMT1R1C : I changed the port to 8080 because my xampp is configured in that way. And the login page isn't in my local host, or im omitting something
U1TMT1R1C : Ok. my mistake, i had running xampp and for this reason the "login" page wasnt accessible. Now im running the integration. I'll test it, thanks for the help
U1JQ8B5BM : hello, i am facing some problems regarding bot in slack. that after some time bot stops listening, what ever users write in DM or channel
U1JQ8B5BM : logs shows nothing
U1U831FNE : <@U1JQ8B5BM>: I've had that problem too and for now just restart the bot every couple of days.
U1DM2B4SY : <@U1JQ8B5BM>: Could also be that it is stuck in a conversation, make sure every branch ends with convo.next().
U1JQ8B5BM : no it is not listening
