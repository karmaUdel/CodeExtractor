U0JBSEGHY : The thing is having `HandleField String` throws errors on all my `onClick` handlers
U0JBSEGHY : That is once I remove the `onInput`
U0JBSEGHY : ```The 2nd and 3rd entries in this list are different types of values.
325|                 [ Html.form []
326|                     [ input
327|                         [ onChange HandleField
328|                         , value model.numberToCall
329|                         , placeholder "Enter a Phone Number"
330|                         , class "login-form"
331|                         ]
332|                         []
333|                     ]
334|                 , h4 [] [ text model.numberToCall ]
335|&gt;                , button [ onClick (MakeCall model.numberToCall) ] [ text "Make Call" ]
336|                 ]

The 2nd entry has this type:

    Html (String -&gt; Msg)

But the 3rd is:

    Html (Msg)```

U14Q8S4EM : Thats weird. What is `MakeCall`?
U14Q8S4EM : Whats the type?
U0JBSEGHY : ```type Msg    = Answer String
    | MakeCall String```

U0JBSEGHY : ```update...            MakeCall number -&gt;
            ( model, call number )
```

U14Q8S4EM : I dont know why you are getting that error. Thats weird.
U14Q8S4EM : This wont solve your problem, but you could also do `Msg = MakeCall | ..`
U14Q8S4EM : and then in your update do `(model, call model.numberToCall)`
U0JBSEGHY : This is my `onChange` ```onChange : msg -&gt; Attribute msgonChange message =
    on "keydown" (JD.succeed message)

```

U14Q8S4EM : What happens if you exclude the second element, does it compile?
U0JBSEGHY : I was hoping to simply pass whatever that gives me to `HandleField` then use debug to see what it gives me. But it keeps saying there is varying types
U0JBSEGHY : Yes if I exclude the onChange it compiles
U14Q8S4EM : Oh, thats interesting. I meant if you exclude the `h4` element tho.
U0JBSEGHY : It starts throwing me everywhere :confused:
U14Q8S4EM : Okay I think I see the problem.
U0JBSEGHY : But it's not concerned about the h4
U0JBSEGHY : until I remove the onInput
U14Q8S4EM : change your `onChange` to `onChange : Msg -&gt; Attribute Msg`
U14Q8S4EM : And tell me what happens.
U14Q8S4EM : Capitalize the `Msg`
U14Q8S4EM : When its lowercase it can be a variable for anything including `Msg` and `String -&gt; Msg`
U0JBSEGHY : ```The argument to function `onChange` is causing a mismatch.
328|                           onChange HandleField
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^
Function `onChange` is expecting the argument to be:

    Msg

But it is:

    String -&gt; Msg```

U14Q8S4EM : Yeah, so maybe I dont understand what you are trying to do.
U14Q8S4EM : Do you want the string of the new value in the field on `HandleField`?
U0JBSEGHY : I was following this for the  Custom Event Handler <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Events#on>
U0JBSEGHY : I was just trying to track a keydown and then I guess pass the string
U0JBSEGHY : then I wanted to figure out how to track a cut and paste as well
U0JBSEGHY : and backspace etc
U0JBSEGHY : basically track anyway that the field could be modified
U14Q8S4EM : Okay. I see.
U14Q8S4EM : Ive never done this exactly, but I bet you could make a custom html event handle that returns `(KeyCode, String)`
