U3HQVHERX : it says "emitted bundle.js" but i do not see it anywhere
U14Q8S4EM : Although I would name it something other than `HandleField`, maybe something more specific to what you are doing
U0JBSEGHY : Yea I am just trying to get it to compile for me first
U0JBSEGHY : The thing is having `HandleField String` throws errors on all my `onClick` handlers
U0JBSEGHY : That is once I remove the `onInput`
U0JBSEGHY : ```The 2nd and 3rd entries in this list are different types of values.
325|                 [ Html.form []
326|                     [ input
327|                         [ onChange HandleField
328|                         , value model.numberToCall
329|                         , placeholder "Enter a Phone Number"
330|                         , class "login-form"
331|                         ]
332|                         []
333|                     ]
334|                 , h4 [] [ text model.numberToCall ]
335|&gt;                , button [ onClick (MakeCall model.numberToCall) ] [ text "Make Call" ]
336|                 ]

The 2nd entry has this type:

    Html (String -&gt; Msg)

But the 3rd is:

    Html (Msg)```

U14Q8S4EM : Thats weird. What is `MakeCall`?
U14Q8S4EM : Whats the type?
U0JBSEGHY : ```type Msg    = Answer String
    | MakeCall String```

U0JBSEGHY : ```update...            MakeCall number -&gt;
            ( model, call number )
```

U14Q8S4EM : I dont know why you are getting that error. Thats weird.
U14Q8S4EM : This wont solve your problem, but you could also do `Msg = MakeCall | ..`
U14Q8S4EM : and then in your update do `(model, call model.numberToCall)`
U0JBSEGHY : This is my `onChange` ```onChange : msg -&gt; Attribute msgonChange message =
    on "keydown" (JD.succeed message)

```

U14Q8S4EM : What happens if you exclude the second element, does it compile?
U0JBSEGHY : I was hoping to simply pass whatever that gives me to `HandleField` then use debug to see what it gives me. But it keeps saying there is varying types
U0JBSEGHY : Yes if I exclude the onChange it compiles
U14Q8S4EM : Oh, thats interesting. I meant if you exclude the `h4` element tho.
U0JBSEGHY : It starts throwing me everywhere :confused:
