```
JSON needs to have string keys.
`{ "target": ... }` vs `{ target: ... }`
Doh

Sweet. Things are moving along!
Hi, how can convert a list of strings, into a single string with its values separeted by ", " ?
or a list of int to a single string separated by ","
I think this can work but not sure if it is the best... String.join "," (List.map (toString) a)
I believe there is a single built info for what you want
<@U2DF486HL> it's the best! 
ahh, yeah String.join is exactly what you want
