U5YK35TAM : How to create a Cmd that will end up in the Msg I want?
U153UK3FA : <@U5YK35TAM> you don't need to call `update` you can just have `init` return `(initialModel, getRandomGif model)` directly
U5YK35TAM : jessta: perfect! that works, thanks :slightly_smiling_face:I guess what I was fixated on was trying to invoke the `MorePlease` Msg, so the call to `getRandomGif` is not duplicated (in case the behaviour is changed later)

U5AR0LDQA : Im using <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/lukewestby/elm-http-builder/5.1.0/HttpBuilder>
What is the best way to handle an empty body response? Im doing a `POST`

U5AR0LDQA : Or any ideas in general? :smiley: Thanks friends
U153UK3FA : You can avoid the duplication by putting it in a function and calling that function from both `init` and ` update`
U153UK3FA : <@U5AR0LDQA> <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#expectStringResponse>
U153UK3FA : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/lukewestby/elm-http-builder/5.1.0/HttpBuilder#withExpect>
U5AR0LDQA : Perfect thank you <@U153UK3FA> :heart:

U0JBSEGHY : Hey I am a little stuck. I'm looking at the Elm Phoenix Socket library and trying to look at the examples but I keep getting this error ```I cannot find module 'Phoenix.Socket'.
Module 'Chat' is trying to import it.

Potential problems could be:
  * Misspelled the module name
  * Need to add a source directory or new dependency to elm-package.json```

U0JBSEGHY : This is the `elm-package.json` ```{    "version": "2.2.0",
    "summary": "Pure Elm state manager for Phoenix channels",
    "repository": "<https://github.com/fbonetti/elm-phoenix-socket.git>",
    "license": "MIT",
    "source-directories": [
        "src"
    ],
    "exposed-modules": [
        "Phoenix.Socket",
        "Phoenix.Channel",
        "Phoenix.Push",
        "Phoenix.Presence"
    ],
    "dependencies": {
        "elm-lang/core": "5.0.0 &lt;= v &lt; 6.0.0",
        "elm-lang/websocket": "1.0.2 &lt;= v &lt; 2.0.0"
    },
    "elm-version": "0.18.0 &lt;= v &lt; 0.19.0"
}```

U0JBSEGHY : I can't seem to see what is wrong here.
U0JFXEUCT : have you added the module to your elm-package.json?
U0JBSEGHY : It's a module that lives within the directory. It is in `exposed-modules` in the `elm-package.json`.
U0JFXEUCT : That's a little confusing, so you have a package in a local dir?  is Chat.elm in the src directory with it?
U0JBSEGHY : I've literally pulled down this library <https://github.com/fbonetti/elm-phoenix-socket>. Gone into the examples and got those errors
U0JBSEGHY : I'm still really new so I've never seen the exposed-modules in elm-package.json. I'm completely stumped as to how I can correct the error
U0JFXEUCT : ah, got it, so you need to be in the examples dir and call elm-make from there
U0JFXEUCT : instead of calling `elm-make examples/Chat.elm`
U0JFXEUCT : you cd into examples and call `elm-make Chat.elm`
