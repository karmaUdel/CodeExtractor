U1BP42MRS : :sweat: Now we are on docker-compose 3 too :wink:
U0NRYQNAZ : the example is the click cli that hypothesis (pyramid app) uses. then you can put this in your make file. <https://github.com/hypothesis/h/blob/master/Makefile#L30>
U1BP42MRS : Oh nice - I'll keep that in my back pocket. I like keeping things stupid simple as long as I can
U0NRYQNAZ : with flask, webpack, and react it's nice.
U1BP42MRS : Yeah - that totally makes sense
U5NMSURAQ : wow that's handy
U1BP42MRS : Yep, honcho is great. already in love
U0NRYQNAZ : glad you likez. :smile:
U3JGK19NV : are there any good channels like this for javascript? im having a small bug

U5CRANMFV : Hi, all.I have three pandas data frame.
Challenge them to unite and write the result to a file.
The first two has common headers. a third plug on the left.
```len(frames)
Out[1]: 3
result = pd.concat(frames)
result.to_csv("file_name.csv", sep='\t', encoding='utf-8', index=False)```
Everything is good, except a wrong result, not beautiful.

I hope for your help, just don't know what I'm doing wrong.
Thank you.

U5NMSURAQ : Looks like you need `merge`, not `concat`.
U5CRANMFV : <@U5NMSURAQ> the first two data frame which has common columns normally unites, the problem with the third.the third has no common poles with the first two.
the `merge` would be for the first and second if I understand correctly.
But why? And so they're fine.

U5NMSURAQ : Due to having no common columns and no index, the third df is just appended to the end
U5NMSURAQ : df.merge will merge the third df and the big one despite no common data between them
U5CRANMFV : nothing happens.first two should be together? Then the two third?

U5CRANMFV : ```f = pd.merge(frames[0], frames[1])g = pd.merge(f, frames[2])

U5UAMM3RB : [silly] question for the slack bot experts: in many examples I keep seeing a variable named BOT_ID, what is this ID? All I get from slack is the bot token
U29163YQH : that's not a silly question. It's the id of your bot that slack return when you use <https://api.slack.com/methods/rtm.connect>
U29163YQH : or `rtm.start` it's useful to filter message coming from your bot
U29163YQH : but normally they shouldn't need it as they can easily retrieve it for you
U48F1FMEJ : this is a pretty basic questions - but when an exception is thrown the rest of the code after where the exception occurred is not executed unless it was handled in a `try` `except`?
U48F1FMEJ : I'm deciding whether I should test code with a context manager of an object that throws an exception, although I don't think I am correct in the what happens
U29163YQH : yes. you can add a `finally` if you want a piece of code to always be executed
U29163YQH : it depends on the what but in some case it can overlapp yes
U48F1FMEJ : so let's say that's the code and we're expecting a new_object to be created based on the paramteters, but an exception can occur like a URLError or something
