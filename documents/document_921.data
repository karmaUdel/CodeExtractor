U5VGKQ2SY : <@U6EN2E1LG> can you reword that and maybe provide some code?
U6EPLSP32 : does anyone have experience with async tasks in django?
U6EN2E1LG : do you get what I am saying <@U60KNBMPX> <@U5VGKQ2SY> ?
U28MDQRL2 : try <#C0LMFRMB5|django> <@U6EPLSP32>. Ask your question there and someone will answer you if possible
U6ETHP4JD : Hi
U2V0Y2WHF : <@U6EN2E1LG> I don't understand what you are trying to do. Can you create a very small example that illustrates what you want? The code you listed here is too long and contains a lot of extra details that have nothing to do with your current question.
U6ETHP4JD : Is there a way to Click on "More" button in Review section in this website and scrape the data using Python and SeleniumThe website is

U2V0Y2WHF : Yes, there is a way.
U2V0Y2WHF : What have you tried? What problems have you encountered?

U6B5YDMHT : I'm trying to extend the User model and have that incorporated into Django Admin. For example add a phone number. I added this to models:`models.py`
```
class UserProfile(AbstractUser):
	phone = models.CharField(max_length=40, unique=True)

	REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['phone']
```

and in `setting.py`
```
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'MyApp.UserProfile'
```
but I'm getting the error `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: AUTH_USER_MODEL refers to model 'MyApp.UserProfile' that has not been installed`

Anyone know what I'm doing wrong, here?

U5VGKQ2SY : <@U6EN2E1LG> are you using 2.7 or 3.x?
U6EN2E1LG : 3.x 
U47RVMQ77 : <@U6B5YDMHT> is related app added to INSTALLED_APPS?
U5VGKQ2SY : <@U6EN2E1LG>  also, see if you can put that while loop somewhere else. Maybe fore the condition checks. So while not in the list of acceptables, repeat the question, otherwise check. Refering to line 21.
U5VGKQ2SY : <@U6B5YDMHT> Try <#C0LMFRMB5|django> or <#C0W0D17MJ|django_learning> channels. There are some really seasoned Django devs in there. Just share your question into one of those 2 and sit back and wait for the magic to happen.
U1BP42MRS : <@U6B5YDMHT> I believe <@U47RVMQ77> is correct, double check that the new app is listed in your `INSTALLED_APPS` - if that isn't it, come join us in <#C0LMFRMB5|django>
U6EN2E1LG : before the condition checks?
U6EN2E1LG : What would you suggest I do for line 21?
U6EN2E1LG : ok so back to my original question, what can I do in my original code to continously go through the program and not reset the list all over again?
U5VGKQ2SY : get user_input.while user_input not in valid_results, print error, ask for input again.
if input in valid_results, continue on w/ conditional checks (`if user_input == 'a'...`)

U6EN2E1LG : Ok I fixed it
U6EN2E1LG : what can I do in my original code to continously go through my program and not have to reset the list all over again each time I run it through?
U5VGKQ2SY : Where is 'the list'? What line number? When does it 'reset'? There are a couple of people who have already suggested that the question is unclear and that the 150 lines of code sort of distract from the core issue.
U5VGKQ2SY : And really, b/c this:```
else: 
    while ret not in ('r', 'x'):
      ret = input("Press R to return or X to exit")
```
is all over the place, I would consider trying this approach
```
get user_input.
while user_input not in valid_results, print error, ask for input again.
only when input in valid_results, continue through to conditional checks (`if user_input == 'a'...`)
```

U6EN2E1LG : It's in line 24 or 25 
U6EN2E1LG : Under the books (selection) function
U6EN2E1LG : Oh I understand now
U5VGKQ2SY : lines 31 and 32 are resetting the lists. The list of books and costs gets dropped down to original
U5VGKQ2SY : lists when that function is called.
U5VGKQ2SY : that call happens in lines 24/25
U6EN2E1LG : Right and I'm trying to figure out how to fix that problem
U5VGKQ2SY : change last line to```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
Move menu() in line 3 to line 2.
Break off the menu part into its own function where it outputs menu options text.
Look into how to pass lists to functions, as you are doing with `selection`
