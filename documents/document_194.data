Hi, I have problems with "interactive messages" .  When I press one button I get the message: ```Oh no, something went wrong. Please try that again.```. I've setup a Request URL in my Interactive buttons panel in my app.  Do I need to use another token? My app does not do the OAuth 2.0's authorization code grant flow  but I use the credentials on the 'basic information' tab.
I'm doing it in Python. If there is some example code. that would be super
Hi. I'm developing a bot that gives access to some admin-level backend systems. Once I've installed the bot in slack, everyone can use it right? There's no way to add some authorization / privileges system to the bot, I've to code it internally, right? Thanks!
<@U0E9LFL3F> correct
fine. better to know before starting a big development iteration for nothing :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U0E9LFL3F> Some bot frameworks, like Lita, have auth functionality built-in.
somebody knows why interactive buttons deliver _Oh no, something went wrong. Please try that again._ ??
this allows multiple people to ask different questions and get respective answers, but cant really collaborate on a single conversation, basically like a public dm
<@U2VMTE1FD> is this answer for me?
<@U4GQR1QM7> when you're sending the message containing a button, are you doing so from your app, the same one that has a registered action URL with it? (or are you posting the message possibly via a custom integration webhook or bot user?) the messages must be posted by the same app that acts as receiver for actions  ---  if you are posting messages from the app, are you receiving _any_ kind of requests to your action URL (even ones that might be erroring or timing out somehow?)
no <@U4GQR1QM7> that was just a general question for everyone
<@U07CW6N3A> yes, I'm sending it from the same app. it has a flask server that serves the action URL. it responds in the browser. however, from slack its not called
how are you posting the message exactly? is the host you're using externally reachable (either with a tunnel to your local machine or on a publicly accessible server)
yes tunneling with ngrok
if you're still having trouble and have checked all this, recommend moving on to Slack's great support team that can help look deeper at the specifics of your setup.
ok. yeah I tried to look into the 'scopes' but things are not clear.
I'm sending the message with regular webapi call chat.postMessage
good point. gonna look into the console
when you send via chat.postMessage, did you get the token you use as part of the install process or are you using one generated by the legacy/test token generator?
yeah I'm initialising the SlackClient with the OAuth &amp; Permissions/OAuth Access Token
"api call "chat.attachmentAction" not ok" ... and an error object with '"invalid_action_url"' inside
not doing any other authentication
That error would indicate that the message, for whatever reason, isn't considered part of your app -- maybe you installed it before you added those permissions and need to do install it for them to be attributed to the tokens you're using.
oohhh. interestin. it kindof works now. The call gets through. I'm getting the response as simple message but before that still the message _Oh no, something went wrong. Please try that again._
the function responses with _return make_response('nice try', 200, )_ maybe that has to be in a specifc format... even tho I still get the message 'nice try' in slack
maybe now you're seeing some kind of timeout behavior -- at least you've got somewhere to go from here :slightly_smiling_face: be careful to respond 200 OK as quickly as possible -- the timeout is pretty short.
its basically the only thing which happens in the method after a print into the console... but indeed. I'm from europe... so gonna call it a day. Thanks alot! :slightly_smiling_face:
good luck! it gets easier from here :slightly_smiling_face:
Hi, guys. Programming Learner here.
I joined today
Hello guys
Hi to all!
<@U2VMTE1FD> we do one bot per team.
thanks! and does it do multi turn conversation?
and does it get confused when multiple people try to talk to it at the same time
obviously if its just one question one answer, it wont get confused
<@U3ES7AM6X> ^
<@U2VMTE1FD> we consider it a convo between 1 person and bot
So others can't answer by default
Even if other people are talking in channel
<@U2VMTE1FD> its a real problem, we use concepts to separate conversations and allow collaboration across multiple team members.
so are you saying that somehow your bot does some kind of topic check to see if it should start a new conversation or continue with an existing one?
<@U04SM6T2H> so just playing devils advocate, but if its just one person per convo, why not just use dm?
<@U2VMTE1FD>: DM or thread def a good option if the interaction is long or not appropriate for public
But a lot of convos add info and context as they happen and also convos in public are indexed 
Yeah threads are very interesting idea for this
Could be 1:team, 1:user, or even 1:thread maybe
Any help is appreciated.
Is there any method or way by which we can set the text in textbox (on occurrence of an event )and the message get posted only when the user hits enter . URGENT !!!!!
poojamandavia19: for slack? no
yes
poojamandavia19: use message buttons instead
I've used message buttons . On basis of those button I want to set the text in text box which user can modify accordingly and then sent it back
try this

Can anybody tell me if yoy know of any contactless payment system for donations. So the user touches the "thing" and a defined amount of money is taken off the card/phone. Any companies that offer a product like this? Ive seen stuff in coffee shops, but there must be something out there.

<@U2Y9F6C3U> This is not the right place :thumbsup_all: 
<@U46ARQJF9>, suggestion: whenever you want to share a link which is so big.. you can short it using URL shortener like <http://goo.gl|goo.gl> :relaxed:
alexbudin: I've seen a <https://www.dipjar.com/> before in the wild. Not sure about anything smaller/contactless.
wow, this looks interesting. Thank you so much. Its a start

I want to control the Phillips hue bulbs in my home office when I get a new notification on any of my Slack teams. This isn't for my team, just for me.  I don't have  administrative control of these teams. Any thoughts or general direction I could start Googling?
<@U4KFSM6CW> you will need _some way_ to install a bot or other integration onto your team
<@U04SM6T2H> That's what I was worried about, and I don't think it will be possible. I've also been looking into using AppleScript to write hooks for notifications locally.
also there is this :slightly_smiling_face:

people who run public Slack channels (like this one): do you deal with reaching invite limits? Is that a navigable hurdle?
Ive only run into invite limits when we did the talkabot channel, and emailing support with a reason why got the limit lifted
I think they prefer optin against an url rather than invite en masse via email
yeah i set up a form via that slack-invite-automation thing for an HBR subscribers slack thing that we're trying — getting an “invite_limit_reached” error message though. in fairness many people have already signed up.
try emailing support about it, they can probably reset your throttle, worked for me
will do, thanks!
<@U4HNCG9LY> please dont run bots in general
rules ¯\_(?)_/¯
thank you <@U0Y7H2F3M>
Hey botmakers!  We're having a super chill Bots + Beers meet-up tomorrow in SF and would be super cool to see some more bot faces out and building community with us! <https://www.meetup.com/Bots-and-Beer/events/238470478/>

I am a boarding school student which cannot go out conveniently. And also, my school is in Oregon, which is a little far from there. Thanks.
is it possible to send data with oauth link which can be obtained where the code is handled ?
I'm trying to use the send/receive middleware to log all conversations to a database.  I can't seem to find how to identify the user.  The message object only contains a channel (no message.user).  Any idea about what I'm missing?
BTW, this is happening on bot.reply
my method is to add message.user manually..
Anyone have experience doing a white label service for bots? Is there an API or service that can be used to generate new Facebook Messenger bots and run through the application process or do you just have to do the good ole legwork in the Facebook developer dashboard?
does anyone have experience downloading files that are uploaded to slack. - in particular with python.. When I use _requests_ and get what is under the *url_private_download* I get the file (mp3) but the metadata (sound-length) is stripped away. with _urllib2_ I find a complete html file under this url :thinking_face:

hello!
<https://diewubbel.typeform.com/to/tNGMmr>
the current installation model is one where the installing user is the owner of the issued tokens, though most apps still act on a kind of team-based context.   You might want to look at using a bot user and requesting the `bot` scope, which will yield you yet another token -- a bot user token, which encodes the agency of your app a bit more clearly
Which hosting is better for slack app in between Heroku and Beepboop if you have used any one of these!
Beep Boop has lots of nice extras for your bot
Heroku is just generic hosting
I see, thanks Ben!
Are there any examples of current widely used bots implementing link unfurls?
davidt: Does the native Twitter integration count?
Not sure. I'm just curious to see any creative uses that people come up with :slightly_smiling_face:
not yet, that feature is super fresh :slightly_smiling_face:
Can I add something like that to my own app ?
Hi all - I'm trying to make a thread with a robust websocket connection using python-slackclient. Anyone have an example of what exceptions I need to catch and how to reinitialise the slack client server when things go wrong? Unfortunately the slackclient tries to protect the caller from exceptions, so I'm not sure what things I need to handle.
(this is for the RTM interface)
Or will the websocket automatically reconnect as necessary behind the scenes?
<@U3U7G58P6> where are you doing this?  message.user is present in the .hears block.  However, after bot.reply call, it's not passed into the send middleware.
which bot are u using
facebook or slack?
What's up? What if we can have a single list of conferences and their participants in AI and chatbot space? <https://medium.com/standuply/best-ai-and-chatbot-conferences-in-2017-55f020acb782>
