U0JAVM98A : or it's only me
U0JAVM98A : we have tons of cloudfront answer
U0KECURAT : <@U0JAVM98A>: us too. RTM errors though
U0JAVM98A : k: ok, for us it's mainly api call
U0GT29N3A : We had lots of 504 timeout errors, but it's good now
U0KECURAT : Yeah, I think we got RTM errors because the bot kept disconnecting due to another error and retrying the connection. I guess we mostly just got ratelimited
U0JAVM98A : 504 rulez
U11FSNKL0 : <https://status.slack.com/>  Connectivity issues for some teams
U0KECURAT : Did slack remove the timezone info from the user object? It doesn;t seem to be on <https://api.slack.com/types/user>
U0GQ2JCCA : i don't see it there, but i do see it on a request (i used `<http://users.info|users.info>`)
U0GQ2JCCA : ```"tz": "America\/New_York","tz_label": "Eastern Daylight Time",
"tz_offset": -14400,```

U0MUZB415 : Is there a plan for Slack to update API documentation? Right now there are a ton of inconsistencies with responses, and very hard to know which fields are optional and which are required
U0MUZB415 : Looks like <https://api.slack.com/methods/oauth.access> has 2 different response schemas based on the scope being requested
U0MUZB415 : Is <http://swagger.io> a consideration?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0MUZB415>: reprot the exact inconsistencies to Slack and they'll work on it
U0MUZB415 : Is there a better channel for that?
U0JAVM98A : gregr: the better channel is to send them an email directly, they fix quicky
U0MUZB415 : awesome, will do
U0MUZB415 : thanks guys
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0KECURAT>, <@U0GQ2JCCA>, there's plenty of undocumented attributes in the API. My suggestion always is to ask Slack to document them or avoid relying on them.
U0CS6NSF5 : consider anything undocumented to be subject to change or removal without notice.
U0TGHKPEU : normally how long does it takes to make the app in slack app directory? :worried::worried:
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0TGHKPEU>: depends on how busy they are
U0CS6NSF5 : patience is adviced :slightly_smiling_face:
U0TGHKPEU : hmm yeah I think i got no choice after all :smile:
U1B3K1WA1 : Hey, I'm trying to use slack-node-sdk RTM inside a `docker` container but can't seem to connect. I think I need to `EXPOSE` a particular *port* but can't figure out which one.Does anyone have any insight?

U11C8V57T : Since the RTM API uses an outbound WebSocket connection, I *don't* think you need to expose any ports from your docker container. What's the actual error you're seeing? (Is it a timeout, a DNS lookup failure, something else? Does the HTTP request to fetch the WebSocket URI fail, or does the actual connect to the WebSocket fail?)
U1B3K1WA1 : <@U11C8V57T>: it actually just hangs ad infinitum :thinking_face: `debug: { '0': 'connecting' }`
U1B3K1WA1 : Since I'm using the node-slack-sdk I don't manually fetch the websocket URI and I'm not sure how to determine if it fails
U1B3K1WA1 : <@U11C8V57T>: I tried to fetch the `ws://` manually and it failed! Thanks for the tip - must be a DNS problem inside docker
U1B45H5DE : Hi there guys! :wink:
U0HBN0L9M : hi
U0HBN0L9M : :slightly_smiling_face:
U196ZMU3Y : Hey, I just had a user of my slack app send me an email telling me that whenever someone on their team uses my app it crashes Slack on their HTC One. Can you guys think of any reason why? I can't think of what could cause it that would be because of my app, but they say no other installed app does it.
U196ZMU3Y : Specifically an HTC One on Android 6.0
U0HBN0L9M : can you see smthg in your logs ?
U0HBN0L9M : what does your app do
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U196ZMU3Y>, report it to Slack, sounds like a problem on their Android app, rather than your integration
U0CS6NSF5 : unless you have developed an Android client :slightly_smiling_face:
U196ZMU3Y : I did not develop the client :wink: thats why I was pretty sure it wasn't my app. My app is just a <http://frinkiac.com|frinkiac.com> image search basically, so it returns an image based on the query text
U0HBN0L9M : :stuck_out_tongue:
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U196ZMU3Y>, tell the user to report it to Slack
U0CS6NSF5 : whatever your integration does, it should never crash a client. if it does, Slack will want to fix it
U196ZMU3Y : Awesome, thank you!
U0YQS1FAR : I once crashed the android app by inviting a bot to a dm channel (I just checked again and it's been fixed)
U1B5MNHNU : Can anyone tell me how to set the log level in say the slack_bot.js example?
U04SM6T2H : <@U1B5MNHNU>: var controller = Botkit.slackbot({
  debug: false
  //include "log: false" to disable logging
  //or a "logLevel" integer from 0 to 7 to adjust logging verbosity
});

U04SM6T2H : debug and log pretty much cover everything
U04SM6T2H : i don't think anything logs at any other levels
U1B5MNHNU : Cool, just read the readme. :slightly_smiling_face:
U04SM6T2H : heh
U04SM6T2H : does that help?
U1B5MNHNU : Yes, it did.
U1B5MNHNU : I am pretty new with node, but if I have to deamonize this as a service, I just run it as a background process?
U04SM6T2H : you might want to look into pm2
U04SM6T2H : <http://pm2.keymetrics.io/>
U1B5MNHNU : ok, will checkout
U04SM6T2H : once your bot is all set
U04SM6T2H : you can run it with pm2
U04SM6T2H : and it will make sure it restarts if it crashes :slightly_smiling_face:
U04SM6T2H : amongst other benefits
U04SM6T2H : but it runs any node app as a service
U1B5MNHNU : ok, looks like this is what I need. Thanks for the suggestion
U04SM6T2H : very handy
U0AQ8GPGR : Hmm, not sure if this is the best channel for this, but I'm thinking about auctioning the domain name <http://botfactory.org|botfactory.org> <https://auctions.godaddy.com/trpItemListing.aspx?&amp;miid=195449451>
Thought this might be interesting to folks here :upside_down_face: 

(Feel free to point me to a more appropriate channel!)  

U14TYLC94 : Hello! Here is some interesting thoughts about chatbots / :slack: bots ::arrow_right:  <http://osvproduct.com/chatbots-whats-the-real-impact-behind-the-hype/>

U1BEXUC8G : Hi there, Nobody had the idea to create telegram bot ?
U0HBN0L9M : there are a number of successful telegram bot makers in here
U0HBN0L9M : <@U0HLC2479> for example
U0HBN0L9M : if I'm not mistaken
U1BEXUC8G : Thanks <@U0HBN0L9M> And for you what's best toolkit/tool for create a multiplatform bot, FB Messenger and Telegram ?
U1BEXUC8G : maybe use botkit with api-ai for that ?
U0HLC2479 : <@U0HBN0L9M>: I got thousands of users back in the days and I learned a lot about the interactions, but I will not call it successful :wink: It was mainly a playground for experimentation.
<@U1BEXUC8G>: we've created a platform for doing multiplatform bots (Messenger, Kik, Telegram, SMS and LINE), but mainly you don't need to code much, only stateless endpoints and your <http://wit.ai/api.ai|wit.ai/api.ai> integrations. So, maybe you want to code it all yourself, in that case I would definitely go for botkit (which I used for a Slack bot, and I loooved it)

U1BEXUC8G : <@U0HLC2479>: Thanks, Really intersting. So, you don't share your beautiful multiplatform integration :disappointed: ? :smile:
U0HLC2479 : checkout <http://reply.ai|reply.ai> :wink:
U1BEXUC8G : nice :slightly_smiling_face: it's your agency :smile:
U0RRCPDK9 : So my teammate Gary has a pretty unconventional approach to what bots should be :slightly_smiling_face:<https://blog.yalabot.com/making-a-conversation-ui-read-this-first-a40ce6b75432#.iq07y2c9s>

U0HUTFBHS : That was a nice read.
U0HUTFBHS : He's spot on, too.
U13PFSATD : Has anyone seen a customization or an app that allows 2 channels to be displayed next to each other.  I believe others have figured out how to add a channel in the right column where the team directory, files, etc can be displayed.  It seems that these guys have succeeded w/the customization (<https://www.wallstjesus.com/>).  I'm a bit surprised that there wouldn't be an app available to accomplish this.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U13PFSATD>: <https://stacktodo.com/timeline>
U13PFSATD : Thanks for the suggestion Ernesto.  I had tried stacktodo and visually it doesn't work as the columns were too narrow.  They definitely have a Tweetdeck feel to them.  Also one of the channels were using is a Twitter feed and for some reason stacktodo won't display the tweets.
U1BRX2BLJ : I'm using the Howdy Botkit to "listen" to ambient messages in a channel.  Works fine unless the message in the channel is posted by another bot,  Is there a way to get visibility to those bot messages?
U1BPBKXK5 : Pretty sure messages from a bot don't get sent to other bots
U1BPBKXK5 : Skynet dontchaknow
U11C8V57T : <@U1BPBKXK5> At a Slack level, this is definitely not true. (Bot messages appear just like any other.)
U0HUTFBHS : `COST_OF_BECOMING_SELF_AWARE = 999999`
U11C8V57T : But it could be that Botkit filters those messages out.
U11C8V57T : <@U1BRX2BLJ>: Try asking in <#C0AV5N8NA>.
U0RRCPDK9 : Yo - posted a Medium article about some nifty bot micro-interactions. :slightly_smiling_face: I'd love to know what you guys think, and if you have any other examples! <https://blog.yalabot.com/3-sweet-bot-micro-interactions-bb737b9ae357#.q0a3zekyj>
U04SM6T2H : Nice post <@U0RRCPDK9> 
U04SM6T2H : Those are nice 
U04SM6T2H : Howdy does the icon swap trick too
U04SM6T2H : Everyone -- we have been working on something special and exciting at Howdy for YOU the members of this community -- TALKABOT, a developer conference deeply focused on bots! 
U04SM6T2H : It will be a 3 day event at the end of September in Austin with 2 days of speakers and a workshop day
U04SM6T2H : Early bird discounted tickets are on sale TODAY and we wanted members of this community to be the first to know
U04SM6T2H : Please come!!
U04SM6T2H : <http://Talkabot.ai>
U04SM6T2H : We have some amazing speakers lined up - the cofounders of SmarterChild!!! The founders of the GetPurple bot!! Folks from Pullstring who built the Hello Barbie ai-powered talking doll!!! And technical experts from Slack, Microsoft, Kik and other platforms and tools
U04SM6T2H : It is going to be the best bot event ever!!!
U04SM6T2H : We have been working on this since literally the day we launched this community! 
U04SM6T2H : Join me in <#C1C09P2JK|talkabot> if you'd like to get involved
U04SM6T2H : And buy tickets now at the cheaper price before they sell out!!
U04SM6T2H : (Oh and fwiw 2 days after Talkabot is the ACL festival where radio head and lcd sound system are playing amongst 40 other bands!)
U0HBN0L9M : congrats, that looks awesome
U04SM6T2H : <@U0HBN0L9M>: thanks 
U0HBN0L9M : this, the twilio api, ... you guys are on :fire:
U04SM6T2H : Just wait and see!!
U0HBN0L9M : :scream:
U18HVKW5P : I'm using the Slack Web &amp; RTM API. What I want is when the `slack.channels.create(..)` method is called that the person who actually called this method to be the one that created the channel.
U18HVKW5P : currently all channels created using this method state that they were created by me, even though other team members have invoked this mehtod
U18HVKW5P : My app isn't registered and I'm using a test token
U18HVKW5P : Any help on how the person who called the method can be made the creator of the channel ?
U04SM6T2H : <@U18HVKW5P> you will need tokens from those other users 
U18HVKW5P : is that what `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` and `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` are for?
U04SM6T2H : Not really
U04SM6T2H : You could do it that way
U04SM6T2H : Have your team login
U04SM6T2H : What you want to do is slightly tricky I think
U0AFABJAJ : Holy shit.
U0AFABJAJ : Nice lineup and timing <@U04SM6T2H>
U0AFABJAJ : + ACL
U0AFABJAJ : All. The. Way. In.
U04SM6T2H : <@U0AFABJAJ>: Booya
U04SM6T2H : Just in can its not obvious, the list of speakers at Talkabot is 3x as long as on the site right now
U04SM6T2H : We will be announcing more folks every few weeks
U04S3JCH2 : if anyone here has questions about the conference or might be interested in sponsoring a bit of Talkabot - please DM me! :cool:
U1C4RHSM8 : what are available bot frameworks our there, i have seen howdy and micorsoft botframework. any discussion on which one is better?
U0CSJUB1D : Botkit has a huge community, much more resources, and is more mature 
U0CSJUB1D : Can't say much about Microsofts 
U1C4RHSM8 : I went through Botkits code in last few days, its not in a very good state i feel, not much unit tests either, is it really ready for production use?
U1C4RHSM8 : are you folks using Botkit to power real world bots? i would want to hear from people who are using it.
U0YQS1FAR : I'm using it in production (many others are as well)
U0YQS1FAR : Our bot is on 600 teams
U0YQS1FAR : and botkit is doing great
U1C4RHSM8 : thanks <@U0YQS1FAR> what is your use case, does ur bot talk across ur org or outside the org
U0YQS1FAR : What do you mean?
U1C4RHSM8 : when you say our bot is in 600 teams what do you mean?
U0YQS1FAR : 600 different Slack teams have installed it
U1C4RHSM8 : i see, cool.
U04SM6T2H : <@U1C4RHSM8> we are very very active in supporting Botkit
U0YQS1FAR : Why don't you head over to <#C0AV5N8NA> with more specific questions
U04SM6T2H : There are many many bots in production
U04SM6T2H : Thousands of teams 
U04SM6T2H : Happy to discuss in detail if you'd like
U1C4RHSM8 : sure,  i had some code related question on why things are implemented the way they are...
U1C4RHSM8 : every time a new conversation is created, you folks create new task and then add the conversation to the new task.
U04SM6T2H : Let's do this in DM if you don't mind
U1C4RHSM8 : sure.
U1C4RHSM8 : sent you a DM <@U04SM6T2H>
U1AQ8MY3U : is there an api call to remove a user from a slack team?
U04SM6T2H : <@U1AQ8MY3U>: I don't think so
U0K7U9LUC : Hello. I am on a very active and large slack team of nearly 5,000 members. Connection on some clients start to be slow because of the traffic. Any tricks/hints/best practice  to bypass this issue  ?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0K7U9LUC>: cross fingers for Slack to do performance enhancements
U0CS6NSF5 : last number I heard, performance started to go down significantly with 3.5K active users
U0CS6NSF5 : although that was a while ago, so the number is probably up
U148BK6NM : Hi everyone. I started developing slack bots lately. Is it possible for bots to add new channels via api? I get missing_scope error when I try this
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U148BK6NM>: bots cannot create channels, you need to create channels with a user token and the `channels:write` scope
U148BK6NM : <@U0CS6NSF5>: Ok, how are these combined?  user token and the scope, sorry for the naive questions. I am a newbie
U148BK6NM : Is it a request that can be invoked from  a webpage, say you have a form that let's you input a channel name with an option of adding to your team
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U148BK6NM>: you request both the `bot` and `channels:write` scopes with the Add to Slack button and will receive two access tokens, one to act as the bot and another one for the user. With the user's access token you will be able to create channels as long as the user has permission to create channels in the team
U148BK6NM : <@U0CS6NSF5>: ahh..for example when I view team detailsI usually see 2 tokens, one for bot and another for createdBy
U0CS6NSF5 : With the right scope on the user token you can create channels :)
U0CS6NSF5 : What you would be doing is: open a channel with the user token, invite the bot to the channel with the same token
U0CS6NSF5 : There are some caveats: a user cannot invite a bot/user to a channel it is not part of
U148BK6NM : Do you use Request for this?
U0CS6NSF5 : Are you using botkit?
U148BK6NM : yes
U0CS6NSF5 : Ask in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit>, I've never used it :)
U148BK6NM : Ok. Thanks <@U0CS6NSF5>
U0CS6NSF5 : Anytime
U0LLUCLP3 : Anyone have good ideas for paid Slack channels? See here to submit:<http://www.ideahunt.io/ideas/8a249f44-53f2-451a-a728-870231258c6d>

U1CFS6GLT : regarding botkit I see mocha is used for testing, wander if possible to test the conversation level like, user.say('hi'), expect(bot.answer).to.equal('Hello!') if does not exist will love to help on this
U04SM6T2H : <@U1CFS6GLT>: we would welcome a PR like this!
U1CJQRMK6 : hmm… might've figured it out by the time someone responds; but am I missing something obvious? when using bot.say():* I get an empty callback (i.e. no message timestamp etc.)
* my message isn't converted (i.e. `&lt;url|title&gt;` shows just as that, instead of showing as “title” with a link)

U1CJQRMK6 : (using webhooks prevents me from posting as “user”; which is also unwanted)ps: “slackbots” does support this; but they don't support conversations and I wanna stick to 1 module

U0K7U9LUC : Hello. Is anyone here aware of any kind of gateway between slack and discourse ?
U0HKDKHD4 : Hey slackers, I wrote a piece on the building blocks of the bot development ecosystem for codeship's blog. Would love to hear your thoughts: <https://blog.codeship.com/building-blocks-first-bot/>
U1CNW7X55 : <@U0HKDKHD4> Some links/platforms there I haven't heard of, thanks. I also noticed "one of the follow NLP-as-a-service providers" did you mean "following" 
U0HKDKHD4 : Yep, I'll send the edit to the editor
U0HKDKHD4 : thanks pal
U1BEXUC8G : <@U04SM6T2H>: Nice for your event, The livestream will be possible ? Thanks
U04SM6T2H : Not sure if it will be live but it will be recorded somehow 
U1116QM2Q : that's unfortunate about the livestream, but if we have a decent recording of it i'm sure it will be very valuable to those of use who can't make it! :slightly_smiling_face:
U1BK91EVD : <@U0HKDKHD4> nice piece, it's definitely helping!
U1BK91EVD : I didn't know there were so many APIs ready to parse human language for me. And _for free_.That part seems a little too good to be true. 
I understand that these companies actually benefit from all these real snippets from actual people, but I have learned to be wary of free services. Especially such a crucial one (it's ok if google fonts is down, this is way different).
Those of you with experience with such services have any thoughts on that ?

U0CS6NSF5 : <@U1BK91EVD>: if you want to develop a toy, go for it. if you want to do anything serious, I would stay away from any service that is unsustainable :slightly_smiling_face:
U0HBN0L9M : <@U1BK91EVD> to the extent that <http://wit.ai|wit.ai> is own by FB, so their business model is different
U0HBN0L9M : but in general, I agree
U0HKDKHD4 : I don't trust the <http://wit.ai|wit.ai> platform. I'm authoring a botkit middleware and a automatic migration script from wit to <http://api.ai|api.ai>
U196ZMU3Y : That's interesting you don't trust wit, I personally just found <http://api.ai|api.ai> to be a better platform.
U0GQLTU75 : how many are intending to attend chef conf? <https://chefconf.chef.io/>
U0HKDKHD4 : <@U196ZMU3Y>, on multiple occasions the entire interface behind <http://wit.ai|wit.ai> has gone down. The direction of their APIs I don't exactly believe in and until facebook Parses it and open sources it I'll be skeptical. To your later point, <http://api.ai|api.ai> is a better platform.
U1BK91EVD : well, thanks for the feedback, i'll give <http://api.ai|api.ai> a try
U1C5VL0EQ : Also, <http://wit.ai|wit.ai> has a habit of drastically changing things on occasion. I think that if you're developing anything serious that isn't immensely complicated you're almost always better off rolling your own NLP with open source libraries like natural (<https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural>) or NLTK (<http://www.nltk.org/>)
U04SM6T2H : ^^ ++
U04SM6T2H : IMHO we should build a botkit-nlp thing
U04SM6T2H : that uses those
U04SM6T2H : and allows you to train and own your own training data
U196ZMU3Y : I would be interested in that
U04SM6T2H : nice!
U0HKDKHD4 : <@U04SM6T2H> <@U1C5VL0EQ> Have you guys checked out the Syntaxnet from Google's Tensorflow project? <https://hub.docker.com/r/brianlow/syntaxnet-docker/>
`echo "Name this boat" | docker run --rm -i brianlow/syntaxnet-docker`

U1C5VL0EQ : I've not, but it looks pretty awesome. Might be a good alternative to <http://wit.ai|wit.ai> or <http://api.ai|api.ai> if you are building something serious and have the time to configure syntaxnet to do what you want.
U0V93GE5R : Added a new channel <#C1D1QF6V7> in response to this thread: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/41>
U1A72QLGL : Hi guys.  I just started perusing this channel.
U1A72QLGL : Have y'all played around with Microsoft's LUIS?
U1A72QLGL : I'm trying to figure out whether I should start messing around with LUIS, <http://wit.ai|wit.ai>, or <http://api.ai|api.ai> first
U1A72QLGL : Btw, I had no idea <http://wit.ai|wit.ai> was owned by FB.
U1A72QLGL : <@U04SM6T2H>: You should definitely build botkit-nlp!
U04SM6T2H : api or luis!
U1C5VL0EQ : To confuse you further, IBM also has a horse in the NLP race: <http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/nl-classifier.html>
U1A72QLGL : Any thoughts on exportability?  It looks like LUIS lets you export apps.  Same w/ all these other guys?
U0HBN0L9M : <@U1C5VL0EQ>: IBM's product is quite different
U0HBN0L9M : I wouldn't park it with the others
U0HKDKHD4 : All, I just wrapped up our <http://Api.ai|Api.ai> middleware, I welcome pull requests: <https://github.com/abeai/botkit-middleware-apiai>
U04SM6T2H : sweet <@U0HKDKHD4>!
U150ECGLS : Hey there! I'm trying to use my own Express server and integrate it with Botkit for a Messenger bot. 
I've read the "Use BotKit with an Express web server” section in the readme but the example provided is a slackbot and I'm trying to do something similar with Facebook; I can't. Do you have any resources or example that could help me?

U04SM6T2H : <@U150ECGLS>: anywhere you see it using controller.webserver
U04SM6T2H : just pass in your own express app
U150ECGLS : <@U04SM6T2H> I just read about this in the FB readme! Thanks a lot! :smile:
U0MUZB415 : Question - Can you add arbitrary custom fields to slack messages that can be read back by the RTM api?
U0K43G63U : has anyone used `builtin.datetime.date` in the LUIS API?
U0563E81H : <@U0MUZB415>: You can use the “id” field, and look for it in the reply_to field <https://api.slack.com/rtm>
U0563E81H : <@U0K43G63U>: It's working, but I have personal/Professional problems with such entities, especially when used in ambiguous settings:- When you say “tomorrow”, without knowing your current timezone it can't make it into an accurate date (tomorrow in Australia and Hawaii are two different dates).
- Cultural settings such as “next week”, or even “next Tuesday” are resolved without regard to a user's locale.
- Personal settings such as “evening”

U0JPS3SHX : Any suggestions for a natural language parser for dates expressions? 
U13DWUG8Y : <http://sugarjs.com|sugarjs.com> is not perfect but can be helpful.
U1BK91EVD : <@U13DWUG8Y>: last update of sugarjs was 3 years ago...
U13DWUG8Y : <@U1BK91EVD>: No it's not. That's the last update of docs directory. Check the latest commit:<https://github.com/andrewplummer/Sugar/commit/f8bd9364062241e72b132dc9cfbe91a6da7d3b65>

U1BK91EVD : apologies, it looked that way on the site (last blog update is 3y ago, featured tweets are 4y old)
U1CNW7X55 : <@U0HKDKHD4> I see your install doc says ```npm install --save botkit-middleware-witai``` I assume that should be `-<http://api.ai|api.ai>`
U0JPS3SHX : <@U13DWUG8Y>: looks like is quite close to what I need but what i am having a hard time is to recognise time expressions from a sentence,
U0MUZB415 : <@U0563E81H> - best news ever, thanks!
U0MUZB415 : <@U0563E81H> - actually a followup question - is that available for REST api?
U0HKDKHD4 : ah yes, I'll make a change, used the template from the <http://wit.ai|wit.ai> middleware for consistency
U0ZNF2Q9J : quick question : anyone have already stress test a node.js application that listen to slack for message ? what is your tricks ?
U123A06V6 : <@U0JPS3SHX>: There's also <https://github.com/wanasit/chrono>, based on the excellent chronic Ruby lib
