U5NMSURAQ : Or should it be the whole domain name?
U29163YQH : this will point `www.my_awesome_website` to the same IP as `c.storage....`
U29163YQH : no you don't need to put the whole name
U5NMSURAQ : so this should work :confused:
U29163YQH : yes
U29163YQH : if you do `dig www.my_awesome_website` you should see the result
U5NMSURAQ : yep
U5NMSURAQ : kinda...
U5NMSURAQ : But of course it doesn't work, therefore my question :slightly_smiling_face:
U29163YQH : well it seems to be pointing the right way
U5NMSURAQ : ```--2017-07-03 21:02:46--  http://.../
Resolving ... (...)... 2a00:1450:4010:c08::80
Connecting to ... (...)|2a00:1450:4010:c08::80|:80... failed: Network is unreachable.

```

U5NMSURAQ : Maybe I'm unlucky and DNS take an unusually long time to update?
U29163YQH : `2a00:1450:4010:c08::80` is the correct IP
U29163YQH : are you sure your network is correctly setup ? can you try on IPv4 ?
U5NMSURAQ : ```wget www.[domain] -O -
--2017-07-03 21:04:04--  <http://www[domain]/>
Resolving www.[domain] (www.[domain])... failed: Name or service not known.
wget: unable to resolve host address ‘www.[domain]'
```

U5NMSURAQ : Huh, now dig returns way less data then 1 minute before.
U5NMSURAQ : Alright, it's probably Namecheap shenanigans
U5NMSURAQ : There is a reason they are not "Nameexpensive"
U29163YQH : did you change something ? I had one time a saved that wasn't taken into account so I just redid it
U29163YQH : they are usually not too bad
U5NMSURAQ : :slightly_smiling_face:
U5NMSURAQ : Thanks for your help
U1BP42MRS : <@U63CJP83X> you'll need to add a lot more context, such as environment (is this selenium?) etc
U1BP42MRS : Libraries you're using, that kind of stuff
