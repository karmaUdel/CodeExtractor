```
<@U5YHX0TQV> It's actually a docker container I use for my dev environment. I have set that environment variable to no avail. Have you had this issue?
<@U08UTJ5PB> is it something that happens to leiningen regardless of the project code? is it a specific network operation in the code that is getting that error?
