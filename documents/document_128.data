all you really need to do is have some ring middleware that populates a session key containing a user-id in the ring request. then your controllers can take that user-id and build whatever authz (role-based, fine-grained permissions based on models, etc) that you want
there are a bunch of helpers for doing things like working with encrypted+signed session cookies
