I also get the data with ```Cmd.batch [ ..., ..., getRolodexLists]
<@U5ABF3BH7> are you sure the http request isn't erroring?
what does the json from the response look like?
Could someone provide me with an example of `uniqueBy : (a -&gt; comparable) -&gt; List a -&gt; List a`?
Like `unique [1,1,2] == [1,2]`
`unique ?? [1,1,2] == [1,2]`
from List.Extra
<@U3HQVHERX> I don't know if this is right, but my guess would be something like unique (\p  -&gt; p.age) personList
or to be a bit more concrete, unique (\x -&gt; abs x) [-1, 2, -3, 4, 1, -2]
:point_up:
thanks!

Could it be that it takes too long to load ( about 3 to 5 seconds)
?
I  am getting an empty like instead
<@U5ABF3BH7> what do you see in the web Dev console when Elm makes that request?
Does the request actually succeed?
You should add some code to your Err case to display something if the request fails so it doesn't silently fail
I get 404 in the console
I don't know why it is failing.
Lots of context the web server can use to give a different response
Do you control the server?
I stupidly forgot to add .json on the url!
Sadly, it is still not worker. <@U153UK3FA>, I am not sure what you mean by if I control the server. I control the json url (through frontend controller)
^ not working
<@U5ABF3BH7> Open up the network tab of devtools &amp; look at the differences of each request, might be some headers you need to add
