U4KTWEHQC : Hey developers! :wave:
Have you ever chosen between NLP and Buttons?
At Statsbot, we did :smiley:
And have made a bet on both approaches.
Happy to share our experience via Slack Developers: <https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/why-bots-should-use-buttons-5f729df17c0#.4d7m8fa1s>

U37C5V3HT : Need some help how to end an existing convo in case of different keyword inputs by user. 
The corebot.js has the following

botkit.utterances = {
        yes: new RegExp(/^(yes|yea|yup|yep|ya|sure|ok|y|yeah|yah)/i),
        no: new RegExp(/^(no|nah|nope|n)/i),
        quit: new RegExp(/^(quit|cancel|end|stop|done|exit|nevermind|never mind)/i)
    };

But how will I QUIT an active conversation let's say if user has enter... "Kdjdjkss" or "la la la" etc that doesn't match with the predefined keywords :thinking_face:

U4LH15MNY : what is the difference between bots and bot user?
U4NSHGFPT : Anyone have experience with nodeJS and Slack's WebAPI ?
U4MQSDJSD : <@U4NSHGFPT>  I have experience with it
U0FQHMRU3 : Hi everybody,
We currently have an issue with rtm.start request for a team: we receive a `org_login_required` error. Someone have seen this error before?

U0FQHMRU3 : For someone that have this error: the team is in migration to enterprise plan. 
U4FSUJLLU : i'm getting an error `cannot find module 'botkit' `when adding  this code:
  ```var Botkit = require('botkit'),
    mongoStorage = require('botkit-storage-mongo')({mongoUri: '...'}),
    controller = Botkit.slackbot({
        storage: mongoStorage
    });  ```
```
module.js:328
    throw err;
    ^

U4FSUJLLU : help
U4N0U55PX : <@U4FSUJLLU> try "npm add botkit"  or "npm install" if already referenced in package.json
U4FSUJLLU : <@U4QCW0MPZ> by 'botkit' in the require does it refer to the howdy's botkit or just a module of it ?
U0AFABJAJ : gilles.mailclark: Did you find documentation somewhere on this error? We are now seeing it too.
U37C5V3HT : Can anyone share live examples of slack interactive buttons that cal from external url? 
U4FSUJLLU : <@U4QCW0MPZ> no add option .. and install doesn't solve the problem
U0V93GE5R : You probably need to reauth after the migration. 
U4N0U55PX : <@U4FSUJLLU> this error means that the botkit node module is not installed. Just install it with the npm add command.
U0CT32R88 : How's everyone's weekend going so far? anyone working today? :nerd_face::heart_eyes:
U37C5V3HT : Hello Everyone! 
need some help. Can you tell me why `team_join` gives the following error wherein `user_channel_join` works 100% error free. This is the error for `team_join` _TypeError: Cannot read property 'say' of undefined_

U37C5V3HT : Okay, another question. How can I validate if my current channel is <#C04SM6TAK|general> ? In botkit. 
U4FK1HA49 : abinash_mohanty: In the payload object is the list of channels, one will be general
```
{ id: ‘CHANNELID',
       name: 'general',
       is_channel: true,
       created: 1459633882,
       creator: ‘USERID',
       is_archived: false,
       is_general: true,
       has_pins: false,
       is_member: false },
```
You can check for is_general: true and record the channel id somewhere to check against

U37C5V3HT : Thanks <@U4FK1HA49> let me try this out!
U0FQHMRU3 : No. I've don't find any documentation. I've ask at slack support. Btw, we currently still have the error. It seems that migration could be very long. 

U0FQHMRU3 : The migration has ended. The bot is reconnected. :rocket:
U0GT29N3A : <@U0V93GE5R> and we didn't need to re-auth :wink:
U0V93GE5R : Cool so it was some weird in-progress issue from the migration, or support fixed you?
U0GT29N3A : Basically we can't connect to the websocket while the team is being migrated
U4Q4HTAD9 : Is there an absolute beginner room?
U0V93GE5R : <#C0J61PA31|botkit-basics> is one
