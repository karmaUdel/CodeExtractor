```
directory exists
just noticed that what is in `COPY` is correct, but different from what error shows. Missing `/` at begining
a `VOLUME` is a better option
was just reading that... `-v` right?
oh... VOLUME in the actual Dockerfile?
and that will keep them synced so I can dev on local and updates container on the fly?
just `VOLUME /usr/share/nginx/html`
that'll map to whichever folder Dockerfile is in?
and the `-v` option  when you run your container,something like `docker run -v /home/lex/Development/Web:/usr/share/nginx/html bla..`
YOUUUUUUU!
