[:find ... :where [clojure.core/identity ?foo]]```
I just picked a random thing with identity in the name, but I hope it translates
ah
I guess I should have explicitly mentioned the `~'` idiom to prevent namespacing
is there a way to do the opposite? selectively pick the symbols I want to namespace qualify
that's harder
instead of the ones I do not want to namespace qualify
mmh ok
nevermind then
thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
