Yes that is what I am missing from Mount :slightly_smiling_face:
Your `example-system` is a Composition Root

<@U0BKWMG5B> Out of curiosity, why did you make the choice of using multimethods for Integrant?
It seems to me (as a clojure beginner) that it introduces a form of global that makes stubbing a bit harder
e.g. wouldn't it be nicer to pass a second argument to `ig/init`: a map from keys to implementations?
I am sure you had a good reason for using multimethods and not the approach I'm suggesting, but I would like to understand it
<@U0BKWMG5B> is it related to hot-reloading?
do clojure files have to have a namespace?
and if so, should tooling not assume that there will be a namespace form at the top?
they don't
and you can put other things before the namespace
(the ns form)
ok
never really know where to go to find the hard requirements on these things so thanks for the info
it is super common to have the ns form be the first thing, so some tooling does assume it
ok. i was not positive if it was convention or spec
so some tooling requires it, but clojure does not
well, if possible, i'd like to conform to clojure requirements and not some subset
there were some namespace cache changes in CIDER that seems to affect files without a ns form so wanted to see what the requirements were. thanks a bunch
@puredanger Are your deps slides available anywhere, until the talk is online?
I mean <@U064X3EF3> ^^
hi all, good morning
how do I check wether a process is alive?
i mean i launched a subprocess
whether with sh or conch
and i'd like to know whether it's finished or not
I'll put some stuff out early next week - slides, code, and some more info
