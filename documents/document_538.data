``` should do the trick.
<@U2D7NUGS1> Thanks for that! Now I need to solve the next issue of atom-elm-format not finding the elm-format binary
Hmm. I have it working. Let me look at my config.
It's probably because there is no executable named `elm-format` anymore. Use `elm-format-0.18`.
<@U2D7NUGS1> That did it. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks mate!
Cool :slightly_smiling_face:
where `StringHappened` is a constructor for my `Msg`. It just so happens that the `detail.value` is a `bool`. Currently in my app nothing happens. I want another variant of `Msg` to be used, say `ErrorHappened`. How can I do it?
It's been addressed at <#C192T0Q1E|beginners> .
Is there an elm version of something like classnames? <https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames>
looks like it would work poorly with Elm’s type system
what do you want to achieve with it?
Elm-html merges class attributes automatically, if that’s what you want. So you can use multiple class attributes
