U3U8Q9B1S : Thank you !
U1BC67ULB : sure thing
U3VGTE66T : hey Guys, when it comes to routes, do you know what is the difference between declaring child routes and just doing it directly? So I can have a route /a and declare a child route that I call b, so I will have a/b or I can just have a and then declare a second route (not as child) and give it a path of a/b
U3VGTE66T : is there a considerable difference?
U2JTYR6L9 : <@U3VGTE66T> , when declaring child routes, the child components will be wrapped by it parent
U3VGTE66T : what are the pros and cons? I noticed that the child routes components are children of the parent component. The thing is, not everytime I am at a parent route I go further to a child, meaning that in this situation the children components (from the child routes) are not used...can this be a downside of it?
U2JTYR6L9 : eg
U2JTYR6L9 : ```&lt;Profile&gt;
  &lt;Dashboard .../&gt;
  &lt;Friend ... /&gt;
  &lt;Following ... /&gt;
&lt;/Profile&gt;```

U2JTYR6L9 : it means that some logic/authorization may be put in `Profile` and the children got benefit from it

U43CA9E5R : Hi. Does anyone know how can i render React components from html string (which i received from my database) ? if i use dangerouslySetInnerHTML i can't bind any methods onClick or other manipulations
U2JTYR6L9 : <@U43CA9E5R> , I think you shouldn't do that. Component should be packed to bundle before using it for best performance
U43CA9E5R : <@U2JTYR6L9>  thank u for ur answer. How can i bind any methods for content that i render from HTML string? for example, i have HTML string with text and images and i have to make each image clickable to show it full version.  How can i perform this? maybe i should not store it as HTML string but as raw content from draft.js. But even in this case i have to parse it on fly when i receive server response

U48T17H6G : hi mates, I have a problem
U48T17H6G : I have a component Element. I have a loop where I create multiple Elements
U48T17H6G : each Element has an state calls owner
U48T17H6G : and when the component its created I call and action in order to update the owner
U48T17H6G : but the states of all Elements update with the same value
U48T17H6G : like they were sharing their states
U48T17H6G : How could I fix that? :confused:
U1BC67ULB : what’s your code look like <@U48T17H6G>
U48T17H6G : my component:
U48T17H6G : function mapStateToProps(state) {
    return {
        owner: state.owner,
        extraInfo: state.extraInfo
    };
}

function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {

    return bindActionCreators({ requestOwner }, dispatch);
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(GalleryElement);

U48T17H6G : the reducer:
U48T17H6G : import { OWNER_INFO_REQUESTED } from '../constants';
export default (state = {}, action) =&gt; {

    switch (action.type) {
        case OWNER_INFO_REQUESTED:
            return action.payload
    }
    return state;
}

U48T17H6G : the action:
U48T17H6G : function fetchOwner(result) {    return {
        type: OWNER_INFO_REQUESTED,
        payload: result
    }
}

export function requestOwner(owner) {
    const url = `${API_URL}`;
    return function(dispatch) {
        axios.get(url)
            .then((response) =&gt; {
                dispatch(fetchOwner(response))
            })
            .catch((err) =&gt; {
                dispatch(fetchOwner(err))
            })
    }
}

U48T17H6G : And how I render the component:
U48T17H6G : return this.props.elements.map((element) =&gt; {            return (
                &lt;GalleryElement key={element.id} element={element} &gt;&lt;/GalleryElement&gt;
            )
        })

U48T17H6G : so, when I call requestOwner action from each component, the state is shared to all of them and this shouldn't happen
U43PCD4KC : emesislol: You should do the request outside of your GalleryElement. Let’s say on gallery container. And then, store each information you want to fetch within an array with a common state key, for example `{ ‘gallery-owners’: [] }`. Then when you’re mapping each GalleryElement you should pass the corresponding index of that array of information you want to pass.
U48T17H6G : thanks <@U43PCD4KC> ! I will try to do that :smile:
U43PCD4KC : Let me know if you find a better approach :slightly_smiling_face:

U4MN5U6H5 : Hello
U4MN5U6H5 : I have a question about arrays mapped to &lt;ul&gt;. When I change a value in the array, it’s appending me the whole list again, rather than rendering that value. Any ideas how to fix this problem?
U1BC67ULB : can i see your code? <@U4MN5U6H5>
U4MN5U6H5 : <@U1BC67ULB> Here it is <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42893798/react-is-not-updating-elements-on-firebase-event/42894671>

U4MN5U6H5 : <@U1BC67ULB> Found the problem. It wasn’t a React problem, it was just JS problem. I was not emptying the list, so of course React was appending :laughing:
