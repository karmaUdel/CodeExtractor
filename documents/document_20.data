Great, thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
where test.txt was one of many files within test.zip and the contents of test.txt were "Hello World!\n\n"
returns a string in this case or nil if no entry was found
<@U5YHX0TQV> thanks for the so link - looks more or less like what I came up with
Awesome! Thank you!
And be careful with slurp'ing in data, you'll have all in memory
Hey! I was wondering if repeated subvecs would ever allow the excluded data to be garbage collected if there was no way to access it any more? Or would I need to use `(vec (rest x))` if I wanted to _actually_ drop the first item in a vector?
I would use a persistent queue but I want in place updates too, performance of `(vec (rest x))` being O(n) is a non-issue for me too, looking for the "idiomatic" solution more than anything :slightly_smiling_face:
damn didn't realize `for` re-evals the inner range expression
