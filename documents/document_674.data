yeah <@U0L8Y8ZEW> helped me on the django channel. btw have a :taco:
<@U5NMSURAQ> :taco: I missed that you could just provide order.index instead of a full on lambda. This will be much better
:heart:
Do you have a specific question about dns ?
<@U29163YQH> I'm using namecheap
Does this record look alright?
Or should it be the whole domain name?
this will point `www.my_awesome_website` to the same IP as `c.storage....`
no you don't need to put the whole name
so this should work :confused:
yes
if you do `dig www.my_awesome_website` you should see the result
yep
kinda...
But of course it doesn't work, therefore my question :slightly_smiling_face:
well it seems to be pointing the right way
