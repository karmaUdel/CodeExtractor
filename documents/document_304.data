yes, exactly <@U0CLDU8UB> !
Okay so what is the problem you are facing?
so this is my first attempt with json decoders.  and i'm able to correctly decode all other data.
but as far as i know i need to specify an alias, so the decoder, can use it to create the Elm object.
in my ex. above.  after Decode.map5.
