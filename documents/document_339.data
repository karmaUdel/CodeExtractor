<@U0FP80EKB> would be nice if elm-format allowed you to put empty lines between parts of that long list, for annotating different categories of related messages
As you start noticing groupinng of messages (such as ones that update the data for our `Embed`), you can pull them into a new one and collapse them, such as `EmbedMsg Embed.Msg`
If you start wanting to annotate, you might be at a point where you want to start grouping them.
oh i see. so EmbedMsg is itself a union
Yeah, notice `FieldHelpers.FieldInfo`, as well. This is how we collapsed editing form fields
