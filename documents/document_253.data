U4RR7KX45 : ah so it should be a type I get it now :smile:
U4RR7KX45 : damn it's so confusing
U48AEBJQ3 : It's... very different from what many people have experience with.
U4RR7KX45 : so if I had 20 fields, do I need to write types for each?
U4RR7KX45 : I mean, define all of them in the type
U48AEBJQ3 : If you want to use all 20 fields to construct some type, you would need a function which could take all of those. Although, I might break it up into smaller pieces at that size.
U300LJUAK : If you need to decode complex type aliases, you should look into elm-decode-pipeline <https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline> :wink:
U4RR7KX45 : I guess that makes sense elm-way.
Oh and also in this example:
<http://elm-lang.org/examples/http>
```
decodeGifUrl : Decode.Decoder String
decodeGifUrl =
  <http://Decode.at|Decode.at> ["data", "image_url"] Decode.string
```
Why is this a constant? shouldn't it be a function?

U4RR7KX45 : oh wait mine is the same :smile: nvm
U48AEBJQ3 : One useful thing that you might not have noticed in the documentation is that:
```
type alias YourFancyRecordAlias =
    { id : Int
    , title : String
    , content : String
    , link : String
    }
```

This gives you an auto-generated constructor `YourFancyRecordAlias : Int -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; YourFancyRecordAlias`

U4RR7KX45 : yeah I saw that. But now I have tons of type related issues.so I created the type
```
type alias Content =
    { id : Int
    , content : String
    }
```

and then my decoder
```
decodeQuoteUrl : Decode.Decoder String
decodeQuoteUrl =
    Decode.map2 Content
        (Decode.field "ID" <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
        (Decode.field "content" Decode.string)
```
but this gives me an error saying that it should be `Decode.Decoder Content`, not `String` for some reason. If I change that to `Decode.Decoder Content`, then this one goes crazy:

```
fetchRandomQuoteCmd : Cmd Msg
fetchRandomQuoteCmd =
    Http.send FetchRandomQuoteCompleted fetchRandomQuote
```

U48AEBJQ3 : Because `FetchRandomQuoteCompleted` is a constructor that takes a `String` not a `Content`?
U4RR7KX45 : indeed it is :smile:
U4RR7KX45 : damn it
U4RR7KX45 : ok one more question please. I want to extract just the content fields from that list, to have a list of string. how can I do that? I tried this```
    Decode.map String
        (Decode.field "content" Decode.string)
```

U48AEBJQ3 : So, you have a list of objects which each have a "content" field, and you want those collected as a `List String`?
U4RR7KX45 : yeah, I want to extract the content from them
U23SA861Y : `Decode.list (Decode.field "content" Decode.string)`
U4RR7KX45 : yes! that's it :smile:
U4RR7KX45 : thank you
U5H8JJP24 : Hi, I've struggeling with a problem for a while now. I got a subscription which decodes an object as a string from the localstorage. I struggle quite some time with this issue, since my compiler gives me following error:```
Error: "Expecting an object with a field named `id` but instead got: \"{\\\"id\\\":3,\\\"name\\\":\\\"12d3\\\",\\\"locations\\\":[{\\\"index\\\":1,\\\"description\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"city\\\":\\\"\\\",\\\"country\\\":\\\"United Kingdom\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Reigate Hill Golf Club\\\",\\\"state\\\":\\\"Surrey\\\",\\\"coordinates\\\":{\\\"lat\\\":51.263834,\\\"lng\\\":-0.161863}}, ...
```
I tried to make every fiel optional except name, and it seems he cannot parse the object.

U0LPMPL2U : This string looks doubly escaped?
U5H8JJP24 : so the \\\ are not normal
U0LPMPL2U : right
