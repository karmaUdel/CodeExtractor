the same kind of event will have different results right now and after the change
I love how a discussion with Slack devs turns into an API feature a few weeks later
incredible platform team :simple_smile:
Hey guys, has anybody tried doing a delayed bot response? Consecutive bot.reply makes the bot post so fast that it doesn't seem too... organic?  Delayed replies could make it seem more human
<@U0XEXKYSV>: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/general/p1460133394001097>
<@U0CS6NSF5>: Thanks!
np :simple_smile:
<@U0XEXKYSV>: Yes, I'm doing that with the bot I've been working on (<http://getyoursidekick.org|getyoursidekick.org>). I actually also use the "is typing" indicator, and then I delay the message based on its length, but with a maximum 2 or 3 seconds.
That way, the responses are not so robotic/abrupt, but also, the user doesn't have to wait for a big chunk of data to load for the sake of "realism".
(Although I'd like to note that I belong to the school of thought that says you shouldn't make your bots appear to be humans, the delay is really just about the abruptness.)
Hey all, does anyone have any experience with load testing on Botkit? I've used services like <http://blitz.io|blitz.io> in the past for http testing, but simulating messages coming in through Botkit's ws connection seems tricky... any thoughts?
I am trying to use Slack APIs  search.messages  - it says you can have boolean queries, but doesnt give an example of the format.  Has someone used it for boolean queries ?  I am trying to do a query for a channel AND user.   This works :  <https://slack.com/api/search.messages?token=xxx&amp;*query=from%3AJohn.Doe*>  and so does    <https://slack.com/api/search.messages?token=xoxp-xxx&amp;*query=in%3A%23channelfoo*>
But how do I do both query=in:channelfoo&amp;from:John.Doe ?
Just use a space to separate them :simple_smile:
`in:#channel from:john.doe`
thanks !   how to do OR ?
I'm running into an issue that when integrations are disabled for non-admins on the Slack org level, I can't even have the user use Identify scope. Is there a work around? Right now it seems like all or nothing :cry:
*anyone*?
Anyone from *Slack* itself have any insights on this?
Hey there!  Just dropped in.  We're working on a 'Sign in with Slack' feature that will address this.
Until then there's no workaround. :confused:
Thanks, would that give the equivalent of “identify” scope?
Also, any high level ETA? (this month, 90 days etc)?
<@U0MUZB415> someone posted about their hack for this a few days ago
looking
<@U07VCKRUK>: Will ‘sign in with slack' send users who authorized in the past right to my app instead of showing the scopes permission screen every time? That is a pain point right now and seems unnecessary to show every time if they already granted permissions.
thanks Alex

<@U07VCKRUK>: When I heard slack was adding an “add to slack” button, I thought it would be more like Facebook, for easy one click login to enterprise apps.
<@U0MUZB415>: ETAs are difficult, but I believe we're targeting release in the next couple months.
<@U0H9CA2MS>: thanks for some reason that link doesn't work
just dm'd you the text
<@U07VCKRUK>: - appreciate it
<@U0554MQJB>: 'Sign in With Slack' will address this as well.
prepping for launch of my Pomodoro Bot: <https://tomatobot.win/>
Thanks in advance
<@U0GPSB7V1>: just heads up, your about page has the “add to slack” button but your home page says “coming soon"
<@U0GPSB7V1>: is that you? <https://slack.com/apps/A0QMVCPAR-tomatobot> The two things looks different but they have the same name.
Hey!
Is it possible to start a conversation without revieving a message before with botkit?
<@U1108D77Y>: maybe ask in <#C0AV5N8NA> :simple_smile:
ahhh thanks! :simple_smile:
<@U0Z1RH1QX>: thanks, forgot about that one!
<@U0GT29N3A>: no, that's a different one :disappointed:
i like that tomato though :laughing:
Hey guys, my app hit the directory story, feel free to share you thoughts <https://www.slashnotes.com>
Thank you!
