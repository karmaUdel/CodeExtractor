U5X2ZRFDF : Well, maybe try Snap. You can still create web templates using Heist.
U5X2ZRFDF : Also Haskell is just getting parameterized modules in the upcoming GHC 8.2, so that will be interesting.
U5X2ZRFDF : Hadn't even heard of Spock yet, could be good. I do share that feeling that no Haskell web framework ever seems right.
U5X2ZRFDF : I saw someone give a talk on using ghcjs with React, and that was pretty impressive.
U5X2ZRFDF : But that's front-end
U5X2ZRFDF : I guess then on the back end you can just use an API and have the front end call it.
U23SA861Y : well frameworks are inherently against good programming practices
U23SA861Y : but, but why do they need them if they already have typeclasses????
U5X2ZRFDF : I'm not sure that I can explain that. I'm still learning about it. But it has more to do with the packaging system.

U2SR9DL7Q : quick question. In the case of a series of piped updates where ```
update msg model = 
    action1 -&gt; 
        (modelchange1, cmd) 
        |&gt; modelchange2 
```  
Will both the model updates occur before the cmd is executed?

U5X2ZRFDF : I'm sort of an Elm beginner, but yes, I believe so.
U153UK3FA : the Cmds won't be executed until after `update` returns
U5X2ZRFDF : The commands are executed in the interim space between events
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U153UK3FA> even if update2 just changes the model and passes along the original command?
U2SR9DL7Q : ```updateBlockedMsg : BlockedMessage -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg ) -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg )
updateBlockedMsg bm ( model, cmd ) =
    case bm of
        Reset -&gt;
            ( { model | blocked = 0 }, cmd )

        Increment -&gt;
            ( { model | blocked = model.blocked + 1 }, cmd )
```
Here's one of my actual ones.

U153UK3FA : `modelchange2` needs to be of the type `(Model, Cmd Msg) -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)`
U153UK3FA : <@U2SR9DL7Q> The model is updated and the cmds are executed after `update` returns.
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U153UK3FA> awesome. I was _almost_ sure that's how it works, but I figured I'd ask to be sure.
U2SR9DL7Q : I've been piping thre commands through successfully already, but now I have a command that depends on a value changed in one of the pipes.
U153UK3FA : Yep, all Elm functions are ‘stateless and side-effect free'
U2SR9DL7Q : It's been a fun day refactoring.
U2SR9DL7Q : _"elm-make.exe: type applications should start with a type atom"_ anyone ever seen this error before? For those using atom's linter
U3SJEDR96 : <@U2SR9DL7Q> hrm, double check your type annotations and definitions, and read through the issue logged on elm-compiler - i've seen that before but can't quite recall the cause
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U3SJEDR96> i ended up just going back to my last commit (small and frequent commits save souls) but it's the second time I've seen.
