I have been using `elm-make Main.elm --output elm.js` and then simply opening _index.html_. How would I use `elm-reactor`?
Right, gotcha, makes sense :slightly_smiling_face: I wonder if it's worth having in an -extra package somewhere, even if it's just `Maybe.map List.singleton |&gt; withDefault []`
<@U5FU80S06> `elm-reactor Main.elm`
simply start `elm-reactor` (it should come with the runtime) and go to localhost:8000

If it shows you your file tree, just click on `Main.elm`. It will run your app with a live debugger.
<@U3SJEDR96> it already exists <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/maybe-extra/4.0.0/Maybe-Extra#toList>
:smile: Ah. Figures :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U5FU80S06> IIRC you can also use `elm-make --debug`
:point_up: i didn't know about that!
