```
<@U4RR7KX45> read the compiler output carefully and think about why it thinks the types are that way. Like, why does the compiler think it should be a `Dict Char v`?
<@U4RR7KX45> Char literals have single quotes eg `'G'`
hmm
didn't know, thank you :wink:
that makes sense now haha
that's it, works yaayy :smile:
thank you all
Hello, i'm new to elm and tried to follow <https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/04-starting/07-multiple-modules.html>, but instead simply make different files to every modules, i also put them in separate folder
but then the files inside the folder somehow doesnt compiled
<https://github.com/iamn00b/elm-tutorial>
any ideas why?
<@U6CHZ5PN1>, If you have module `Bar` in file `Bar.elm` of folder`Foo`, the module name should actually be `Foo.Bar`
<@U6CHZ5PN1>  sorry about the typing errors
i've tried to change the name to `Type` or `Type.Type` but same error
it said that Main can't find the module
but if i change the source-directories to `['src', 'src/type']` it compiled
<https://github.com/Bravilogy/generator-elm>
webpack + elm + sass
<@U6CHZ5PN1> try naming your folder `Type` rather than `type`
<@U3SJEDR96> ah it works if i also name it to `Type.Type`
There you go :slightly_smiling_face:
is in elm i should use capital for folder, or is this related to webpack/elm-webpack-loader?
also thanks! :slightly_smiling_face:
Elm wants a 1-1 mapping of path &lt;-&gt; module
do I have to use Random.generate for Random module? Can I not just get a random value? Or is Msg needed because Random is impure?
is there a way to make module `Type` but it live on `Type` folder? like how index.js works
