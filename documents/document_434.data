I'm using the elm vim formatter which is pretty ruthless in its enforcement of white space... a        L     O     T      of whitespace
O  n  c  e     y  o  u     s  t  a  r  t     r   e  a  d  i  n  g     i  t     t  h  o     y  o  u     s  t  a  r  t     t  o     w  o  n  d  e  r     w  h  y     e  v  e  r  y  t  h  i  n  g     e  l  s  e     i  s     s  o     c  r  o  w  d  e  d

haha yes. I've found it also pushes me to write many small functions instead of nesting things deeply
true, it doesn't really work with long functions
definitely makes sense with the terse / dense idiom
I feel like I"m getting closer and closer to a form of pure notation as my career goes on
