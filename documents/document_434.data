U5WS7CJLV : yeah, 5.1.1 seems to be the current.  So := is no more?
U1ZFF0E5P : no more
U1ZFF0E5P : with elm 0.18 the direction is to not use custom operators (such as :=)
U5WS7CJLV : for the best it seems
U5WS7CJLV : hard to keep track of all the operators
U1ZFF0E5P : they are hard to google for help, confusing, not descriptive...
U1ZFF0E5P : yeah I'm with you!
U5WS7CJLV : :fire: :allthethings:
U5WS7CJLV : all the operator things anyways :smile:
U5WS7CJLV : I guess the math operators can live...
U1ZFF0E5P : the new version looks like this for reference (out of one of my projects) ```studentCourseDecoder : Decoder StudentCoursestudentCourseDecoder =
    decode StudentCourse
        |&gt; required "id" Json.Decode.string
        |&gt; required "startDate" (nullable date)
        |&gt; required "endDate" (nullable date)
        |&gt; required "signOffDate" (nullable date)
        |&gt; required "comment" (nullable Json.Decode.string)
        |&gt; required "studyReason" studyReasonDecoder
        |&gt; optional "course" relationshipDecoder NotIncluded
        |&gt; optional "courseDescriptor" maybeRelationshipDecoder NotIncluded
        |&gt; optional "studentCourseClass" relationshipDecoder NotIncluded
        |&gt; optional "studentCourseUnits" relationshipListDecoder NotIncluded
        |&gt; optional "fundingScheme" relationshipDecoder NotIncluded
        |&gt; optional "employer" maybeRelationshipDecoder NotIncluded
        |&gt; optional "referralSource" maybeRelationshipDecoder NotIncluded
        |&gt; optional "notifications" relationshipListDecoder NotIncluded
        |&gt; optional "deliveryLocation" maybeRelationshipDecoder NotIncluded```

U5WS7CJLV : you are using elm-decode-pipeline?
U1ZFF0E5P : yes
U5WS7CJLV : cool - thanks!
U1ZFF0E5P : this is from a project not using pipeline: ```connectionDecoder : Json.Decode.Decoder ConnectionconnectionDecoder =
    Json.Decode.map7 Connection
        (Json.Decode.field "server" serverDecoder)
        (Json.Decode.field "databases" databasesDecoder)
        (Json.Decode.field "driverName" Json.Decode.string)
        (Json.Decode.field "serverInfo" Json.Decode.string)
        (Json.Decode.field "clientInfo" Json.Decode.string)
        (Json.Decode.field "serverVersion" Json.Decode.string)
        (Json.Decode.field "connectionStatus" Json.Decode.string)```

U1ZFF0E5P : as you can see I have to use `Json.Decode.map7`
U5WS7CJLV : yep, that's what I been doing so far.  Because I am a n00b.
U1ZFF0E5P : which is not ideal as it only goes up to `map8`
U1ZFF0E5P : yeah definitely use pipeline, it's really nice :stuck_out_tongue:
U5WD40ZA9 : Anyone used keystonejs together with elm?
U1ZFF0E5P : I havent personally, but in my experience the choice of backend doesnt really matter when using elm
U1ZFF0E5P : everything has to go through elm decoders anyway
U2SR9DL7Q : anyone else encounter an issue with fontawesome when setting up webpack in the elm tutorial?
U663M2MB7 : Are records immutable in Elm? I have been doing `(Model x y z)` for now, when updating the model. `{ model | x = y }` just feels so wrong to me. What am I missing? :confused:
