U4BMZ90T0 : The dll is literally in there with the `.exe` and it's attempting to pull it from somewhere else
U4BMZ90T0 : Found a google group post regarding `vcredist`
U2BS4M1RV : Are you compiling on Windows?
U4BMZ90T0 : Yeah
U4BMZ90T0 : I'm still wondering about the MEI thing because what happens is when I run it it says the DLL can't be found in c:/.../temp/pyinstaller/_MEIxxxx/python35.dll
U2BS4M1RV : Are you expecting it will be there?
U4BMZ90T0 : No I am not at all
U4BMZ90T0 : I have no clue where it gets that path from
U2BS4M1RV : pyinstaller with the onefile flag should really be including that with it.
U2BS4M1RV : That path is where your files are extracted to.
U2BS4M1RV : ```def resource_path(relative_path):
    """ Get absolute path to resource, works for dev and for PyInstaller
     This is used to find included data files in pyinstaller version
    pyinstaller makes an environment variable? that has path to the included data files
    any hardcoded path should use this function as open(resource_path('/templates/my.template'))
    Do not use this for user entered files, such as the mcot csv or for outputted files
    """

    if hasattr(sys, '_MEIPASS'):
        return os.path.join(sys._MEIPASS, relative_path)

    return os.path.join(os.path.abspath("."), relative_path)
```

This is what I've used to access included files, such as textfsm templates.

U4BMZ90T0 : Where should this go?
U4BMZ90T0 : Top of main file?
U4BMZ90T0 : Or hook
U2BS4M1RV : No, you use that in your open lines.
U2BS4M1RV : Example:```
        with open(resource_path('templates/jinja2/evc-map.jinja')) as f:
            template = f.read()
            jinja = Template(template)
```

U2BS4M1RV : But, with your missing dll, something else is going wrong.
U2BS4M1RV : Have you tried to compile something simple to see if that works?
U4BMZ90T0 : Yes I'm using a simple helloworld.py script it works fine
U2BS4M1RV : That's really weird. The only issues I ran into with pyinstaller were that it wasn't ready for 3.6 and I had to use the dev version, and with one of my tools for some reason it couldn't figure out the imports so I had to manually specify every single import.
U4BMZ90T0 : Yeah I had to downgrade to 3.5.3
U4BMZ90T0 : Okay so given the code to grab the _MEIPASS envar, where exactly do I need to be putting the code within open lines
U2BS4M1RV : The function I gave you is if you need to open an included file. For example if you have templates or html you include in the package.
U2BS4M1RV : You can't use that for the python dll, because nothing is going to happen without that dll.
U4BMZ90T0 : Yeah makes sense. But I just dont get this error at all. I've found so many posts on it in 2 hours and I'm just lost
