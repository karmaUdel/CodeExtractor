```
what you doing with List.extra in there
you don't need that
Because `List.Extra` already implements zip?
<@U48AEBJQ3> That last implementation is probably as nice as it will get.
zip is just map2
I wouldn't pull an import just for (,)
In all likelihood you'll be using other stuff from List.Extra anyway
