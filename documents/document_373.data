<@U65GZU4MR> no there is no such shortcut
<@U3LUC6SNS> looks like it's defined a few lines further down
<@U5XC2FJ1Y> thanks, should have been more observant!
Is there an Elm function for determining whether a character is either in a given string or a given list of characters?
<@U3LUC6SNS> there is `String.contains` and there is also the `Regex` module for more advanced stuff
Unfortunately I need to check whether a character is in a string (or, alternatively, an array of characters)
use `String.fromChar` instead of `toString`
`toString '.'` will give you the string `"'.'"`
…many quotes there… :slightly_smiling_face:
