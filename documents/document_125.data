      (transmit from routing final-message))))```
the transmitter has all this incidental data - who is sending? who is the target? what data did the initiator of the request expect to get back with any responses? what is the path the overall task should take through the system?
But that's basically the approach I was suggesting with a "DatomicWriter" protocol, no?
v1 wrapped this in calls to partial
that "wraps' transact
the difference is that this returns an object that acts like a function
maybe I misunderstaood what `@(d/transact ...)` is in the transact-wrapper function
