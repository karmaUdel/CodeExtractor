U5MQ18UFK : Thx. Earlier they released versions every half a year. So i hope that 0.19 will be soon)
U0EUHKVGB : There is no need to fear: the community is both large and strong, and NoRedInk is a great parent company for Evan to be based at, since it is home to people who love and use Elm every day. If there was a concern, it would be addressed.
U5GSVKPJS : I don't think you will be able to expect that
U0EUHKVGB : <@U5MQ18UFK> There is no fixed timeline for releases - if you see the document I linked, it will explain why (<https://github.com/elm-lang/projects/blob/master/roadmap.md#what-is-the-timeline>)
U0GR6DHEK : My compile times have gone crazy long. elm-make hangs at file 37 (of 42) but how can I find out what file that corresponds to?
U0EUHKVGB : It will be released once there it has be sufficiently ironed out, and the features all fit together in a way that makes sense.
U0EUHKVGB : <@U0GR6DHEK>, find the ones with the big case statements
U0GR6DHEK : that means ones `case (x. y, z, w, t) of`, correct
U0GR6DHEK : ?
U0GR6DHEK : I don't have any of those as I know it is an issue
U0EUHKVGB : ```case x of
  1 -&gt; ..
   2 -&gt; ..
```
this case statement has 2 branches

U0GR6DHEK : or does it also mean long update functions
U0EUHKVGB : find the ones which have more than 16ish
U0EUHKVGB : Yeah, update function also counts
U0EUHKVGB : e.g if you have 32 constructors for `Msg` then you probably have a giant `case..of` to go with it
U0GR6DHEK : is there any way of knowing which file is causing the slowdown (by name)
U0EUHKVGB : Not easily, atm
U0EUHKVGB : You can do some things like compiling one file at a time, with your elm-stuff folder already populated and your elmi/elmo for that given file deleted
U0U6ML22H : maybe using a CLI tool to find Messages.elm files with over 12 lines and checking manually
U5MQ18UFK : yes, i saw this. But having a plans and doing smth is a different things) Document it is good, but i want to be shure that all ok. I need to start new big project and i want to use elm. But using in production something, that has version above 1.0, is dangerous imho
U0EUHKVGB : <@U5MQ18UFK> Elm has been used in production by several companies safely since 0.15 :wink:
U5MQ18UFK : version below 1.0 :slightly_smiling_face:
U2LAL86AY : pff i'm having trouble underestanding if i can use this: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rundis/elm-bootstrap/3.0.0/Bootstrap-Form#group>
like this: 
```
validationFeedback : Validation.ValidationState -&gt; List (Form.Option Msg)
validationFeedback state =
    case state of
        Validation.Invalid -&gt;
            [ Form.groupDanger ]

        Validation.Valid -&gt;
            [ Form.groupSuccess ]

        Validation.NotValidated -&gt;
            []

```
the error is:
```
Cannot find type `Form.Option`.

`Form` does not expose `Option`. 
```
this means what ? because `Form.Option` is not exposed - i can't build my `validationFeedback ` function?

U0EUHKVGB : Don’t let the fact that it’s not `1.0` put you off - Elm’s versioning is not semantic versioning.
U2T2MKL58 : <@U0EUHKVGB> It would be nice to have a list of companies that are using elm in production.  Do you know of such a list?
U0EUHKVGB : <@U5MQ18UFK> Version numbers are just labels, really.
U5MQ18UFK : ok, thants
U5MQ18UFK : thanks*
U0EUHKVGB : <@U2T2MKL58> <http://elm-lang.org/>, but it’s by no means complete at all.
U0EUHKVGB : See at the bottom
U5GSVKPJS : yay, my company is there :slightly_smiling_face:
U2T2MKL58 : yeah.  I knew about that one…would be cool if there was a more complete list.  I think I saw
