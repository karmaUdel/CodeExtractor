Thank you! :rubberduck:
<@U3U2EA14G> Sure, it's perfectly okay to use Go on the backend.
But I don't know how to pass from page to page. Example I use go render two pages html is index.html can cart.html. In index.html how I call elm file ? (Elm.Main.embed(mountNode) and if I choose product from index.html  and how can it pass it in cart.html ?
- a full "web app", also called Single Page Application (SPA), where all the navigation etc. actually happens within the index.html
You could for example make your shopping cart in the cart.html page with Elm, and have the rest of the page be a traditional HTML page.
so can we use ELM build a list component. example index_component.elm, cart_component.elm ... ? And from it. we will integrate it in html file ?
Yeah, that should work.
I learned from you. Thank you so much :+1:
can you split your Elm app into chunks/modules so parts of teh app can be loaded lazily on user request?
last time I checked Elm produced one giant JS file
That's something that might come with 0.19
<@U0CLDU8UB> that'd be awesome. thanks

any suggestions or references or examples on learning how to use elm-tools/parser
I just open sourced an Elm app. Its an Ethereum crypto-currency wallet. <https://github.com/dosco/42wallet>
I’m a pretty mediocre elm coder but the app has some good patterns and is a good read if people want to figure out stuff. It’s got multiple pages, ports, decoders and more :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U2VUFCK5G> you can post it to <#C0K384K4Y|news-and-links> as well
Thanks did that, posted it here since this channel had a much larger following.
Webpack, brunch, something else. What do people prefer?

<@U0CLDU8UB> <@U3SJEDR96> <@U2W22AHNU> I have to circle back about my previous issue with scroll events that aren't fired till scrolling actually stops. Previously we came to the conclusion that the OS is stopping js execution till the scrolling stops. But I just found out that when I attach a scroll handler with plain jquery that fires as I scroll.
Still not sure if it is Elm's fault or something else but I couldn't really find much about this issue. I am working on a MacBook with MacOS
What is the exact code you used with jQuery?
Basically what I am doing is 1) Attach the scroll event with elm and send the result through a port to JS, those events are only fired after the scroll
2) the jquery version is something like this `jQuery('.table-container').on('scroll', () =&gt; console.log('log me'))`
did you try the pure JS version of that?
no i didn't
let me try
ok the pure js version works just like jQuery
I have also tried something a bit more heavy in computing, like recursion and manipulating the DOM in the callback but those also really worked fine.
