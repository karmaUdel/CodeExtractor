Execute the script with `python3.6`
nice spot
<@U3JGK19NV> - consider using some virtualenvs to avoid this in the future :slightly_smiling_face:
I will work on a video for that, it's been coming up a lot recently
ooo we can add it to the learning resources.
ahh i figured it out, i used pip3.5, which i've never used before
I'm getting a new computer in a few days, how can I prevent myself from having 7 different python versions?
and yes, I was setting up the virtualenv wrapper but ran into an error doing so
what model mac, windows, etc.?
mac!
on a mac i install brew and then install python2 and python3. you definitely don't want to use system python for anything.
then i use penv to manage python versions and virtualenvs.
ahh ok
Yeah, mac is popular enough I can focus on it. Then I can learn windows :stuck_out_tongue:
I'll try to do it over the weekend and it'll be free
Thanks!!
windows you just install python from the msi.
and make sure you check the box to add python to the path.
Yah i'm trying to install virtualenvwrapper
but am getting that
my virtualenvwrapper seems to be here `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`
your going to want to add some lines to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file.
it's different if i'm using zsh, correct?
