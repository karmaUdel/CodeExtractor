U3LUC6SNS : Hard to do much on the old machine since I can't type a space with the  incompatible keyboard.
U3LUC6SNS : server.js is an express web server.  I looked in webpack.config.js and found no `api.js`
U3LUC6SNS : Ah here it is: in `package.json`:```
"scripts": {
    "api": "node api.js",
    "build": "webpack",
    "client": "webpack-dev-server --port 3000",
    "start": "nf start"
  },
```

U3SJEDR96 : right. So your Procfile probably has a `yarn client` in there somewhere... It's a little odd that foreman decides to stop on your current machine, but continued on your older machine. I suppose you can remove the `yarn api` part of your Procfile for now..
U3LUC6SNS : <@U3SJEDR96> Commented out `api yarn api` in `Procfile`.  The error is now```
172-10-18-240:koko_client2 carlson$ yarn start
yarn start v0.27.5
$ nf start
[WARN] No ENV file found
6:27:11 AM client.1 |  sh: webpack-dev-server: command not found
6:27:11 AM client.1 |  error Command failed with exit code 127.
```
Could there be a problem with `PATH`?  It is now
```
172-10-18-240:koko_client2 carlson$ echo $PATH
/Users/carlson/Library/Haskell/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/carlson/.rvm/bin:/Users/carlson/dev/node_modules/mathjax-node/bin
```

U3SJEDR96 : it seems to expect webpack to be installed globally
U3LUC6SNS : OK, how would I do that?
U0CLDU8UB : `yarn global add webpack`
U3SJEDR96 : yarn global add webpack would probably fix that, though I do suggest trying to make sure it uses the local path
U3LUC6SNS : I'll give these suggestions a try.  Thanks <@U3SJEDR96> and <@U0CLDU8UB> Yikes
U3LUC6SNS : Yikes what a pain this is!!! I did `yarn global add webpack`, then `yarn start`  Error message is```
172-10-18-240:koko_client2 carlson$ yarn start
yarn start v0.27.5
$ nf start

```

U3LUC6SNS : `$ which webpack` returns nothing
U0CLDU8UB : ahh, `webpack-dev-server` is being used directly in the scripts, too
U3LUC6SNS : Yes
U3SJEDR96 : can you test `yarn client`?
U3LUC6SNS : ```172-10-18-240:koko_client2 carlson$ yarn client
yarn client v0.27.5
$ webpack-dev-server --port 3000
sh: webpack-dev-server: command not found
error Command failed with exit code 127.
```

U3SJEDR96 : did you run `yarn` to install npm dependencies?
U3LUC6SNS : I don't believe so.  Doing that now  Lots of activity.
U3SJEDR96 : :thumbsup:
U0CLDU8UB : and if that doesn't get you any further, then maybe `yarn global add webpack-dev-server`?
U3LUC6SNS : All working!!! I had to kill some stray `webpack` processes, but then ... YAY!!  Thanks so much. Would never have been able to do this by myself.
U3SJEDR96 : <@U4BJ8UDCP> module names in elm match the filesystem 1-1: `src/Foo/Bar.elm` corresponds to `module Foo.Bar`. Case sensitivity is also important.
U3SJEDR96 : (the above assumes `"source-directories": ["src"]`)
U4BJ8UDCP : Hi there - I'm having some trouble with the module system - The compiler can't find one of my modules.
in my ```elm-package.json``` my only source-directory is written as "source".

my folder hierarchy is:
```
/source
    /server
        Main.elm (named "Server.Main")
        Request.elm (named "Server.Request")
```
Server.Main fails to import Server.Request :disappointed:

U3SJEDR96 : Yeah, go for `/Server` instead :slightly_smiling_face:
