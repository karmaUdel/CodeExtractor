```
everything is showing from the same user, which is correct.
<@U272P5K71> are you seeing what I'm seeing here or am I jumping the wrong direction? It looks like the most recent message user is being overwritten somewhere in the client call.
They allow you to test your chatbot against a huge amount of potential inputs
Has anyone here had any success getting a user's location data, outside of timezone?
For instance, data with regards to the user's team's office address?
<@U419E6R60> why would you want their precise location? that might freak them out a little
<@U419E6R60> I am looking for this currently myself and asked in here how people were getting it, but did not hear a response. If you find anything, pass it along.
Depends on platform, device, and UX for getting lat/long to the bot, but if everyone's building app killers, should we focus on the most important apps people have used to kill? :slightly_smiling_face:
<https://medium.com/@mmatty/retention-hero-bb236f055462>
Not sure where else to put this, so: How does one create one of those forms for public Slacks that auto-invites people who put their email address?
<@U21U8SZ2P> there are a few open source projects like <https://github.com/rauchg/slackin>
Also, I've been working on an app that will give you a hosted (ie, you don't need a server as with Slackin) invite landing page, and you can choose to allow invites to get automatically sent, or you can manually moderate. Take a look, <https://www.topsail.io>, and let me know if you have any questions about how it works.
Unrelated, but does anyone know the type of data storage Slack uses? SQL or NoSQL?
i've heard mysql
with redis for some stuff
Thanks <@U107N3ZJS> 
This is a good write-up <@U3S76QAMQ> <https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/slack/>
hi guys, just started today with botkit. short question: I run the pizza example but convo.ask(...) doesn't wait for my response and goes all the conversation at once.  any idea why?
Ah, we're not going to use it for general knowledge, more spesific for each course/class with depth into the topic at hand for lectures and papers connected to those. Testing a few ideas at the moment, if it shows to not be efficient we'll have to look at other options. Thanks for the reply.
<@U107N3ZJS> <@U0U32UM43> thank you both! Will look into these.
hello! does anyone know if Botkit supports displaying checklists the same way you display buttons?
what
like, displaying a list of 5 checkboxes and the user can select any number of them before hitting a submit button
not only does botkit not support it, neither does Slack as far as I know
right, people usually fake it using emoji  :white_check_mark: :ballot_box_with_check:
haha, cool
using interactive buttons
<@U42ERK879> that can happen if you're running the bot as the same user that you initiated the conversation with. The folks over at <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> should be able to help more than the general channel
thanks, guys!
Is there a good forum to search for potential FAQs for? I'm just getting started and ... kinda want to take a real good stab at RTFM
I would start with this starter kit: <https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/botkit-is-better-with-slacks-events-api-f9a27e051591#.qqgw31wyr>
and feel free to ask questions here, or search the history,
Hey guys~ I need your experience. When you develop slack app, how do you make local development environment for debug or running the endpoints? This app always requires trusted-SSL so I always have to deploy the code first to see the logs. It's really uncomfortable.
its best to have multiple apps for that purpose, so you can test internally with one set of tokens and then push the code to your production bot with another
<@U0V93GE5R> thanks for the link. I've already got a hubot up and running. What I want to do is enable users to provide feature requests. But maybe that will be easier with the botkit resources, I'll look into it. Sadly I'm not having much luck with searching history.
<@U0V93GE5R> but how?? How does the app invoke your computer with trusted SSL?
<@U0V93GE5R> is it possible to have trusted certificate SSL on you computer??
yep, look at localtunnel or ngrok
you can stand up a ssl endpoint locally for testing purposes
you can also use a private gomix account <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack>
wow.. now i am trying ngrok. downloaded the installation file and run it..;; but why was antivirus activated?? it just automatically deleted the file~!!!!!
ngrok is legit, id suspect its a false positive.
kaspersky is killing me..;; it keeps deleting it..;;
I had an anti-virus delete a game because it sent data out.
Either whitelist ngrok, or spend a couple of bucks on a virtual private server.
or use gomix until you outgrow it
roberttod: <@U1X1Y2NN8> didn't we have this issue before? I think you had solved it.
hey guys, thanks for letting me in
Just have one question that- Im new to botkit but I want to know the best way to implement a botkit bot onto a website chat? I can only see integration for the popular messaging platforms. Thanks
<@U437YUERL> you mean through one of the integrations? You'll have to do that custom
Thanks <@U0KECURAT>, I thought....so, use botkit then integrate into node/react inside the website? Would be great if there was a library out there already for making pretty at least
nope, the other way around. botkit takes care of the slack/messenger/whatever-it-integrates-with part
You'll have to write your own for the website :slightly_smiling_face:
oh snap. well thats much harder. Is that why i don't see a lot of them and people just direct to use on their messenger/slack etc platform?
Microsoft seem to have something that would help if I built through them -  <https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat>
haven't tried the microsoft thing, but it's not too hard to build your own ¯\_(?)_/¯
<@U0KECURAT>, is it asking too much for a bit more info on what you mean (I'm a data guy, the other guy is the dev guy)
Sure, let's do it in a PM though
thought this would help. If you are using rasa_nlu the native format is a bit difficult to use. I wanted something more simple and like the <http://API.ai|API.ai> synonym model so I built the rasa model generator to create learning models. <https://gist.github.com/claytantor/ddaa1dbb1d4ce7ac8182b9bf2481d3b8>
also just saw this if you are using ML shared models. This is what dronze should be using. It solves the shared model problem. “DeepMind's PathNet: A Modular Deep Learning Architecture for AGI” @IntuitMachine <https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/pathnet-a-modular-deep-learning-architecture-for-agi-5302fcf53273>
Looking for examples for web-based bots, and websites that rely on a conversational UI.
