U0GT29N3A : <@U0GPSB7V1>: is that you? <https://slack.com/apps/A0QMVCPAR-tomatobot> The two things looks different but they have the same name.
U1108D77Y : Hey!
U1108D77Y : Is it possible to start a conversation without revieving a message before with botkit?
U0GT29N3A : <@U1108D77Y>: maybe ask in <#C0AV5N8NA> :simple_smile:
U1108D77Y : ahhh thanks! :simple_smile:
U0GPSB7V1 : <@U0Z1RH1QX>: thanks, forgot about that one!
U0GPSB7V1 : <@U0GT29N3A>: no, that's a different one :disappointed:
U0GPSB7V1 : i like that tomato though :laughing:
U0SDZFGCX : Hey guys, my app hit the directory story, feel free to share you thoughts <https://www.slashnotes.com>
U1111404Q : Hello! I have a question. I am trying to use this api function: <https://api.slack.com/methods/users.getPresence> to retrieve if a user is 'online' or not (note I am not talking about 'presence'). This is available only for the user that the bot is authed (in this case the bot I have created). How can I retrieve this information on other team members too?Thank you!

U0TTN1XST : anyone else ever get an error like this?``` /app/node_modules/botkit/lib/CoreBot.js:825

U0TTN1XST : trying to use the botkit-storage-mongo module, but having no luck so far
U1108D77Y : Can u give us your code snippet?
U0TTN1XST : well that's just the thing - I haven't touched CoreBot, so trying to track down what else could be triggering an error in my code
U0TTN1XST : I'm still getting the “No persistent storage method specified” error on load, and it looks like the app is crashing when I make a `controller.storage` call… so I'm guessing that's it
U1108D77Y : Can u show me your controller.storage call?
U0Y32KTV1 : <@U0TTN1XST>: There's a couple other rooms that may get you an answer faster: <#C0AV5N8NA> <#C0HGSHT7T> <#C0HJSNQUV> I'd start in the general botkit room as the storage one doesn't get a lot of traffic…. not sure about the storage-mongo room.
U0TTN1XST : <@U0Y32KTV1>: thanks man… yeah the mongo room doesn't seem to have much activity, but I'll check in <#C0AV5N8NA>
U0GT29N3A : Would people be interested in a word translation app ? If yes, please DM.
U1116QM2Q : Hello there! I'm new to this but i've been asked to develop a bot for our company that will integrate with our App. I've been looking at the tutorials and dozens of info sites that are around and i have a few questions that i'd like to ask. Maybe you'll be able to answer or at least point me in the right direction! :smile: so far i've been able to use the botkit to actually create the bot and play around with it for a bit to make it communicate that part so far seems to be under control, my question right now is how can i add functionalities to slack itself… let's say that i'd like my bot to answer with a message of the following type:
This is a nice message, click here to open a window

Where ‘here' would be clickable and on click it would open like a frame where i would be able to load an html page.. i mean similar to the dropbox integration for slack where you click on the plus button and then it opens a frame where you can login to dropbox and then select a file to upload it to the slack channel.

How would i go about it? Any documentation around where i can find out more about how to open custom frames?

U0GT29N3A : I reckon it's not possible, you can only use regular links which open a browser. I'll be glad to be proved wrong, because I think it would be a wonderful feature!
U1116QM2Q : That's the thing though, i know it's possible because if you add the Dropbox integration to slack, then you'll have another option under the “plus” sign which is Import from dropbox, which as the name implies it will open an iframe or window (not external, from within slack) that loads the dropbox view where you can select files that will be then uploaded to the slack channel you selected
U0GT29N3A : Dropbox is a native app, they can access more things than the public API :simple_smile: It's like when you do "/remind" you have actionnable links with links you can click and don't open a window. These are called "interactive messages" and are on the short-term roadmap.
U0HBN0L9M : <@U1116QM2Q>: it's on the roadmap
U0HBN0L9M : not available for us poor peons for now, but real-real-soon-ish
U1116QM2Q : ah, i see so it's because they partnered with them to develop a native integration
U0GT29N3A : <@U0HBN0L9M> is that the "deeper integration points" which is on the "mid-term" category?
U1116QM2Q : alright i guess i'll have to plan another way around it
U0HBN0L9M : "interactive messages" I reckon
U0HBN0L9M : I can be wrong - ask <@U0D7LHNTX> here or when he comes to Paris :simple_smile:
U0GT29N3A : <@U0HBN0L9M> do you think interactive messages will include native iframes?
U0HBN0L9M : :thinking_face:
U0HBN0L9M : :cold_sweat:
U0GT29N3A : Roadmap link (if anyone wants to see) <https://trello.com/b/ZnTQyumQ/slack-platform-roadmap-for-developers>
U0GT29N3A : I think it would more fall in the "deeper integration points" feature
U0GT29N3A : And I never heard this would be available "real-real-soon-ish"?
U0HBN0L9M : "interactive messages" in "near term" ?
U1116QM2Q : i wonder that they actually mean with interactive messages
U0GT29N3A : <@U0HBN0L9M>: Yes, but this is not the "Dropbox frames".
U0GT29N3A : <@U1116QM2Q>: This is interactive messages : <https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T04SM6T1Z-F0KH45XNX/quick_actions.png>
U0GT29N3A : <@U0GT29N3A|julian.mailclark> mentioned a file: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/files/julian.mailclark/F0KH45XNX/quick_actions.png|quick_actions.png>.
U1116QM2Q : oh i see that will be a nice feature, i kinda figured it was already available but i guess it's not :stuck_out_tongue:
U113YKYHF : Hello everyone.
U0HUTFBHS : Hello!
U1116QM2Q : hi there!
U0J283T6E : Hi everyone, we just launched <http://metachat.io|metachat.io> and it's on hacker news!<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11504273>

U0HUTFBHS : a+ for linking to the actual story instead of the hn homepage :simple_smile:
U0FHTRT7F : cool
U0GPKTHQ9 : how does message deletion of bot messages work? Under what circumstances can a user delete a bot's message?
U0GQ2JCCA : don't take my word for it cause it might not be completely true, but, doesnt it depend on your admin settings?
U0GQ2JCCA : <https://i.imgur.com/Gjx8P9e.png>
U0TTN1XST : been beating my head against a wall getting botkit-storage-mongo to work on heroku. Anyone been successful with this and wants to give me a hand?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0TTN1XST>: you can probably get some help at <#C0HJSNQUV>
U0TTN1XST : <@U0CS6NSF5> yeah I'm in there, but it's a little dead
U0CS6NSF5 : it's Friday evening, so that might have to do with it :simple_smile:
U0GPKTHQ9 : <@U0GQ2JCCA> that's what I thought as well, but getting a ton of different results with different types of bot messages (ie. rtm, slash command, chat.postmessage)
U0GPKTHQ9 : talking to <@U07VCKRUK> on zendesk now :stuck_out_tongue:
U07VCKRUK : ha, oh hi.
U0CS6NSF5 : :wave: <@U07VCKRUK> :simple_smile:
U0GPKTHQ9 : this slack is so great haha :100:
U04SM6T2H : Whoa we broke 1600 members recently!
U1147ATKJ : Hey guys ! I have a question. Does somebody knows how I could create a bot that automaticly add reactions to any message posted in a specific channel ?I tested to ask to slackbot to say "+:emoji: every time somebody says random, but slackbot post "+ *the emoji*" and does not add any reaction...

U1147ATKJ : I also tried to leave blank the section that represent which word has to be written to activate the bot, but I can't leave it blank...
U1147ATKJ : Thanks!
U0GQ2JCCA : you could hit the web api after every processed message
U0GQ2JCCA : <https://api.slack.com/methods/reactions.add>
U0GQ2JCCA : rate limits though, so im not sure if that's the best method
U0GQ2JCCA : especially if you meant every time somebody says something _in random channel_
U10QUHT9S : sorry for the repost from <#C0K8617D5> but I've got a (hopefully) quick question!&gt; I'm receiving the slash commands and writing back to slack, but I can't seem to figure out how to interact with the slack API. 
If this isn't something I'm going to be distributing can I just use my test API token? Or should I be using a token I receive when I authorize the botkit instance? If it's the latter.. how I do I get that token?

U1147ATKJ : <@U0GQ2JCCA>: not every channels, but only the ones I selected !
U0D1YNBEE : Hi everyone, we launched support for Facebook Messenger bots on Beep Boop! [video] <https://blog.beepboophq.com/welcome-to-beep-boop-facebook-messenger-bots-9fd28f8ef934#.m8nb4zpgx>
U0D1YNBEE : I'd love to hear what you think :pray:
U117FDTLH : why I cant use botkit's controller.storage save data
U0SSVS33N : how are you calling `pushTodoWork`?
U1188F7HR : hello!
U1188F7HR : i had a quick question, i was wondering how i can get the user's display name from a message?
U117FDTLH : user's name and other info is privacy info. you need use oauth to get authorize
U0GQ2JCCA : eh?
U0GQ2JCCA : maybe im not understanding the question but you dont need oauth for that i thought?
U0GQ2JCCA : or i might be being dumb, but you can hit web api for that info, no?
U117FDTLH : answer <@U04S1QCPC>
U0GQ2JCCA : <https://api.slack.com/methods/users.info> `real_name`
U0GQ2JCCA : processing the message and hitting the endpoint of the user who sent it maybe, or like i said i could be misunderstanding
U117FDTLH : oh yes.
U117FDTLH : i'm wrong
U117FDTLH : <@U0SSVS33N>: i found the reason.  this path `./data/` base the project root,  not this file's dir.
U117FDTLH : how do you append data to json file?  get all, append data, then save all?
U0SSVS33N : I expect it would be *very* cumbersome to do it any other way, yeah.
U1188F7HR : i was talking about the username
U1188F7HR : converting the user ID into the username, rather the actual name
U1188F7HR : so if i wanted to convert my user ID i would get seanc back
U0SSVS33N : If your bot really needs to know the username, you can get it with `<http://bot.api.users.info|bot.api.users.info>({ user : &lt;id&gt; }, function (err, response) { ... });`
U0SSVS33N : assuming we're talking about botkit here
U0SSVS33N : if you only know the user id but want to show their username in a message, having `&lt;@id&gt;` in the message text will do
U0AQ8GPGR : Hey folks! Is there anyone who's not a member of <http://botmakers.org|botmakers.org> and is getting random Slack invitations?
U0AQ8GPGR : I'd appreciate if you could DM me a list of groups you were invited to, other than the list below, and if you received invitations to an email that's unique to a particular Slack, I'd appreciate that information as well! Thank you!
Did anyone get invites from groups other than these?

- <http://hashtagtesting.slack.com|hashtagtesting.slack.com>
- <http://embercommunity.slack.com|embercommunity.slack.com>
- <http://dev4slack.slack.com|dev4slack.slack.com> 

U0AQ8GPGR : <@U04SM6T2H> Any idea what's up?
U11BE5P7D : I was invited to those as well, <@U0AQ8GPGR>
U055FHACC : <@U0AQ8GPGR> I got ember and something with “testing"
U0HBN0L9M : <@U0AQ8GPGR>: same here - hashtag testing and ember
U0HBN0L9M : what's going on ?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0AQ8GPGR>, are all those communities in any of those sites to manage slack invites?
U0AQ8GPGR : <@U0CS6NSF5>: No idea, but that's a great question.
<@U04SM6T2H>?

I'll check with the other groups soon.

U04SM6T2H : I got those invites too
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0AQ8GPGR>: I received the two invites 2 minutes apart, so I doubt it might have been one of those services “growth hacking"
U04SM6T2H : Maybe someone exploiting the slackin thing?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U04SM6T2H>: it's a weird exploit
U0HBN0L9M : <@U0CS6NSF5>: growth hacking but one same person behind the 2 groups ?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0HBN0L9M>: no, some of those sites doing some kind of “auto-invite to related groups” without approval from the admins from any of those communities
U0CS6NSF5 : that would be my guess
U0CS6NSF5 : ¯\_(?)_/¯
U04SM6T2H : Hrrm
U04SM6T2H : Someone warned me the other day that the list of member emails was public
U0CS6NSF5 : that's always the case
U0CS6NSF5 : some teams have trouble with spammers (self-proclaimed growth-hackers), going into teams and adding the emails to mailing lists
U04SM6T2H : Ughhhh
U0CS6NSF5 : I think I might have received some from this or botmakers, since I've received un-solicited bot-related emails
U0CS6NSF5 : I'm in so many teams I cannot even track where those come from XD
U11DEDDM2 : perhaps it is a growthack coming from slack, the more slacks we are in the more engaged we are :wink:
U04SM6T2H : My inbox is filled with people saying "why did you invite me and where did you get my email address"
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U11DEDDM2>: data doesn't back that up, though :wink:
U0CS6NSF5 : churn in public slack teams is huge, and just a small percentage of people who sign up then are signed in on a regular basis
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U04SM6T2H>: what services have you provided admin tokens to?
U04SM6T2H : Ughhhh I will have to review 
U04SM6T2H : I assume this is through slackin
U04SM6T2H : But could be wrong 
U0AQ8GPGR : Hmm, I have to double check if I gave access to any of these Slack list websites...I did briefly give access to <https://www.hamsterpad.com/>, but that was in early February,  and only for a few minutes, while I was giving feedback to its creator, who requested it...
Not that the length would matter... 

U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0AQ8GPGR>, your members have been spammed but you nobody received invites to your team, is that right?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U04SM6T2H>: it can definitely be through Slackin, some people add captchas to slackin actually
U0CS6NSF5 : plus the link to T&amp;Cs or CoC
U0CS6NSF5 : e.g, the one we've got for <http://gophers.slack.com|gophers.slack.com> - <https://gophersinvite.herokuapp.com>
U04SM6T2H : <@U0AQ8GPGR> Amir from slack says the people getting these are all members of botmakers. That sound right?
U0HBN0L9M : yep for me
U0H9CA2MS : yes for me
U11DEDDM2 : yes
U04SM6T2H : What would the motive be to do this
U04SM6T2H : Weird!
U04SM6T2H : Makes us look bad!
U0ERLS5EH : I'm only in this Slack and I _did not_ receive any invites
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U04SM6T2H>: either some ill-conceived feature from a “hamsterpad-like” site
U0CS6NSF5 : or somebody trying to piss people off and put some pressure on Slack to make team directories private
U06E352LU : yes me too
U04SM6T2H : Well that's good at least - not spreading from here yet
U11FREHHU : I got the 3 emails too asking to join the three communities 
U04SM6T2H : Thanks for the info
U04SM6T2H : Sorry for the spam but maybe you'll find us a useful community :)
U06E352LU : I was already in it :wink:
U0HBN0L9M : on the bright side, the emails were asking to join legit, interesting communities
U0HBN0L9M : on a related note, *HERE IS A FREE INVITE TO <http://PHISHACK.SLACK.COM|PHISHACK.SLACK.COM>*
U0GT29N3A : Same as <@U0ERLS5EH> here: not in botmakers and didn't receive invites
U11H2RMTR : I am in botmakers and I got 3 invites just now. But, I'd been meaning to join this one anyway
U04SM6T2H : <@U11H2RMTR>: just now? So it's still happening
U04SM6T2H : I might have to shut down the front door
U0F9T9KPH : I'm hearing someone scraped botwiki
U04SM6T2H : But why
U04SM6T2H : When bots attack!! Heh
U0F9T9KPH : No confirmation on why. But a bunch of people were added to Slack's testing environment too.
U0F9T9KPH : Bots on bots.
U04SM6T2H : Yeah
U0F9T9KPH : I think this is how skynet starts.
U04SM6T2H : I don't think that is slacks official testing env fwiw
U04SM6T2H : But yeah
U04SM6T2H : The revolution has begun
U04SM6T2H : A bot is lining us all up
U04SM6T2H : Against a wall
U0F9T9KPH : You're in Austin too, is that right?
U04SM6T2H : Yeah!
U04SM6T2H : We are having a meetup tonight 
U0F9T9KPH : Oh nice.
U04SM6T2H : If we done wash away :ocean:
U0F9T9KPH : This weather is making me want to nap.
U04S3JCH2 : <@U0F9T9KPH>: are you in Austin?
U0F9T9KPH : I am!
U04S3JCH2 : rad! we'll have to meet up sometime
U10RG35FW : Had to jump several puddles to get into work this morning
U0GQ2JCCA : <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/general/p1460990563000209> i read `app`
U0GQ2JCCA : like, make an app
U0GQ2JCCA : and i was about to ask you to give me your weather
U0AQ8GPGR : <@U0CS6NSF5>: 
&gt; your members have been spammed but you nobody received invites to your team, is that right?

That appears to be the case.

U0AQ8GPGR : Where would I see sites to which I gave permission with Slack? Connected Accounts?
U0D7LHNTX : They would be listed under the installed integrations and apps at the moment
U04SM6T2H : I'm finally in a spot where I can look at the activity on our slackin
U0AQ8GPGR : <@U0D7LHNTX>: Thanks! I already checked there...but like I said, connecting to any of these services even for a few minutes, months ago, is enough for them to get the email addresses, so it doesn't even matter now :confused:
U0D7LHNTX : :sob:
U0D7LHNTX : Changes are coming, <@U0AQ8GPGR> . Changes are coming.
U0D7LHNTX : (Like, good ones)
U0AQ8GPGR : Ha, yeah, it has to get worse before it gets better, or something like that :simple_smile:
U0D7LHNTX : Reading the scrollback…
U0AQ8GPGR : I contacted Slack support, but I guess there isn't much they can do, can they? Can they figure out anything at all from their logs?
U0D7LHNTX : It totes is public: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/general/p1460983651000142> All you need to do is generate an API test token for this site, and call `users.list`…
U0D7LHNTX : I am not on botmakers, didn't get the email. No idea what hashtagtesting is, but it is totally not a Slack-owned team.
U0D7LHNTX : That's really weird, hard to understand the motivation behind that spam. But this is a problem with public Slack teams—the working assumption is that you are using Slack for work, so you already know everyone's email address. Of course, that is not true. So take care with what email addresses you sign up for public Slack teams with :wink:
U0D7LHNTX : <@U0AQ8GPGR>: There is nothing they can do if the cat is out of the bag
U0D7LHNTX : And nothing they can do to keep it from getting out again
U0D7LHNTX : I'll ask our PMs about the possibility of a feature whereby admins can make email addresses private.
U0AQ8GPGR : It really doesn't make sense, because...if it's one of those "list of public Slack groups" services, trying to grow their users' userbase...you can't really take credit for it, because, you know, you're just spamming people?
U0D7LHNTX : Who is the email purporting to be from?
U0AQ8GPGR : Yeah...like I said, if they already saved the emails from Botmakers, they can do anything they want with them...
U0AQ8GPGR : <@U0D7LHNTX>: 
These groups were reported:

- <http://hashtagtesting.slack.com|hashtagtesting.slack.com>
- <http://embercommunity.slack.com|embercommunity.slack.com>
- <http://dev4slack.slack.com|dev4slack.slack.com>

I was forwarded one of the emails, it's just the regular "You're invited to join the <#C053MPU24> Slack team" invitation.

U0AQ8GPGR : It just seems to be "from" each group's admin.
U0D7LHNTX : That's…ok, that's even weirder.
U0D7LHNTX : Has anyone reached out to the slackin people?
U0AQ8GPGR : I am not _100%_ positive I connected to that site. Is there a way to see _past_ integrations?
U0F9T9KPH : <@U0D7LHNTX>: a different I talked with someone from Slackin this AM. He has no idea what happened.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0D7LHNTX>, slackin is open source
U0D7LHNTX : <@U0AQ8GPGR> it is probably moot. As I mentioned, it could be an app—or it could be any user. Any of us can call `users.list` or `<http://users.info|users.info>` with our personal tokens, and scrape the email addresses that way.
U0CS6NSF5 : you just install it in your servers
U0D7LHNTX : <@U0CS6NSF5>: I know :wink:
U0CS6NSF5 : some people install slackin with a captcha to avoid these things
U0CS6NSF5 : “avoid"
U0CS6NSF5 : you can get around captchas too
U0AQ8GPGR : <@U0D7LHNTX> Ah, oh well, then being able to hide the emails is the only real way to prevent this.
U0D7LHNTX : Yeah.
U0D7LHNTX : DM me if y'all learn anything new…
U0AQ8GPGR : Thanks, <@U0D7LHNTX>!
U0HBN0L9M : <@U0CS6NSF5> how would that prevent it?
U055FHACC : but the mails say who they are from. one says "Tim Hordern (<mailto:tim.hordern@gmail.com|tim.hordern@gmail.com>) sent you this invitation. “ the other says Ryan Cromwell (<mailto:ryan@heysparkbox.com|ryan@heysparkbox.com>)
or were those names scraped as well? I dunno

U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0HBN0L9M>: a captcha would make it harder and more expensive to automatically send invites via slackin
U0HBN0L9M : ah ok
U0HBN0L9M : I thought it was the other way round
U0CS6NSF5 : those names are probably from the admins who created the admin tokens to setup whatever service is being used to send the invites
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U055FHACC> ^^
U0D7LHNTX : <@U055FHACC> : oh really
U0D7LHNTX : <@U0CS6NSF5> is right.
U0CS6NSF5 : :nerd_face:
U04SM6T2H : OK
U04SM6T2H : here's the IP address
U04SM6T2H : 181.140.139.75
U055FHACC : Ernesto is right, that's an axiom. But what does it mean, sorry? That they are the ones responsible, or they were exploited by someone else? or?
U04SM6T2H : I see 989 hits to the slackin POST
U04SM6T2H : from that IP
U04SM6T2H : its reporting as someone using Safari
U04SM6T2H : could be spoofed
U04SM6T2H : but
U04SM6T2H : I'll be blocking that IP
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U055FHACC>, that they have no fault, somebody probably spammed people using their slackin
U0D7LHNTX : So, someone got a list of botmakers email addresses, and then sent them all invites via Slackin to other teams. Is that the thought?
U04SM6T2H : Yes
U04SM6T2H : that is almost certainly the case
U04SM6T2H : we've blocked access from that person's IP
U04SM6T2H : and now I will send a bunch of apology emails
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0D7LHNTX>, wouldn't that IP be in the audit logs from botmakers?
U0CS6NSF5 : unless they used different machines to get the data and send the invites
U0CS6NSF5 : or they got the emails long ago
U0CS6NSF5 : but it might be worth checking
U0AQ8GPGR : I have a pretty busy day ahead of me, so please DM me if anyone has any questions for me, or any notes. Thanks everyone!
U10QEN21G : I can't help but chuckle a tiny bit. The security breach is serious but it really feels like a friendly reminder to tighten up our game. 
U04SM6T2H : yup
U04SM6T2H : Just such a weird vector
U04SM6T2H : like
U04SM6T2H : what is the motivation
U10QEN21G : My guess is to encourage us to take security into account. 
U10QEN21G : Hackers/makers. We're nice ppl. Typically.   Seeing a security risk out there, in an emerging space, a totally valid reason to carry out something. 
U10QEN21G : And the payload -&gt; bring us all together to talk about it!
U11H2RMTR : I just got another invite
U11H2RMTR : this time to a team called gobgp
U0GPSB7V1 : i haven't gotten invited to anything :disappointed:
U10QEN21G : I've got nothing yet.  Seems to be a Twitter handle associated with that acronym
U11H2RMTR : based on this project: <https://github.com/osrg/gobgp> their link also points to a slackin instance
U0D7LHNTX : That's good to know!
U0D7LHNTX : I wonder what the pattern is…
U0GPSB7V1 : ironic that something related to bgp would attempt to spread like a virus...
U11H2RMTR : what is bgp?
U0GPSB7V1 : it's the protocol for advertising routes on the internet
U11H2RMTR : heh
U0YQS1FAR : gobgp is on the front page of HN. Haven't heard of it before now. Seems like it might be related? There's a link to slackin on the GitHub page
U11H2RMTR : interesting to know <@U0YQS1FAR>
U0554MQJB : I don't think the solution is for Slack to block access to users for all teams, this just seems like an issue for public slacks that let anyone in. Analogous to google or yahoo groups admin controls.
U11L76YQK : Hello! I have a quick question. i am trying to messages where other users are mentioned an retrieve that users information for the bot to use, using BotKit. I was wondering if anyone knew of any sample of public projects that implement that that i could look at?
U11C8V57T : <@U11L76YQK> Maybe a question for <#C0AV5N8NA>. `<http://bot.api.users.info|bot.api.users.info>({ user: '&lt;USER ID HERE&gt;' }, function (...) { })` might be all you need?
U11C8V57T : <@U11L76YQK> I made a quick little bot to demonstrate. :simple_smile:
U11PQPLUC : Oh, are you talking about my friend Mat Scott?
U11C8V57T : One more test, then getting rid of what would be annoying bot. :simple_smile: <@U11C8V57T>
U11PQPLUC : Oh, are you talking about my friend Steve Marx?
U0HBN0L9M : people, I created <#C11Q41CR3> to discuss, well, messenger related stuff
U0HBN0L9M : could be botkit-messenger if that's the main topic, by the way
U0QTSKUH2 : Hey, I'm wondering if it's possible to prevent Slack from merging messages with each other. I want to send messages from my bot with different `icon_url` and/or `username`s. But the messages get shown under the first `icon_url` and `username`.
U11FSNKL0 : <@U0QTSKUH2>: Slack will not show a new icon if the user_id is the same and the messages are less than 5 mins between them. because they are from the same user_id, they show all together. anyway I agree that if the username is different they shouldn't be merged, you should ask Slack about that, maybe they can change it (at least on web). create a help request in your slack team. HTH
U0QTSKUH2 : <@U11FSNKL0>: I see, thank you
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0QTSKUH2>: are you setting `as_user` to false?
U11FSNKL0 : <@U0CS6NSF5>: if you set as_user to true, you need the token from that user right?
U0CS6NSF5 : `as_user` set to true with a bot token sends the message as coming from the bot
U0CS6NSF5 : with a user, it sends it as coming from the user
U11FSNKL0 : ok, thanks, I assumed (I should have asked) that he didn't have each token from each user...
U0CS6NSF5 : here's the info: <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage#authorship>
U11RM4ELV : hi
U11RM4ELV : i am creating scheduling bot. i have one difficulty when sending message from incoming webhook to my custom bot. i want to send direct message to my custom bot specific to individual user.
U11RM4ELV : is there any extra parmeter i have to pass??
U11FSNKL0 : <@U11RM4ELV>: you need to send to the channel: message.user (so you send to that user), and you need to use as_user: true
U11FSNKL0 : you are using postMessage right?
U11RM4ELV : <@U11FSNKL0>: yes i am using postMessage
U11FSNKL0 : yep, then send those 2 params and the user should receive the msg in your bot user DM
U11RM4ELV : ok
U11RM4ELV : <@U11FSNKL0>: hi
U11FSNKL0 : hi
U11FSNKL0 : did it work?
U11RM4ELV : let first understand my scenario
U11RM4ELV : i am sending message from outside of slack using webhook
U11RM4ELV : i want to send message to individual user, but at user's bot DM
U11RM4ELV : i have implemented one cron script that send message
U11FSNKL0 : are you using botkit?
U11RM4ELV : no
U11FSNKL0 : oh you mean as Slackbot?
U11RM4ELV : i am using library that is built in php
U11RM4ELV : yes
U11FSNKL0 : oh... then don't use the as_user: true, just the channel: user_id
U11FSNKL0 : but that works with the web api, I'm not sure with the webhook...
U11RM4ELV : yes it send message to particular user
U11RM4ELV : but it will shown in slackbot Dm
U11RM4ELV : not in my custom bot DM
U11FSNKL0 : oh ok, so you want to receive in the "my_bot_username" DM... in that case you need to set as_user: true
U11RM4ELV : ok
U11RM4ELV : just pass user_id in channel parameter and set as_user:true
U11RM4ELV : let me try it...
U11FSNKL0 : ok
U11RM4ELV : <@U11FSNKL0>: please see the screenshot that i have sent
U11RM4ELV : in that you find my custom bot named "demobot"
U11RM4ELV : i want to send message to there but you can see that it will send to slackbot
U11FSNKL0 : I didn't understand if you are using the web api method postMessage or if you are using a webhook?
U11RM4ELV : i am using webhook to send from external service
U0QTSKUH2 : <@U0CS6NSF5>: yes, you can't set username and icon_url with as_user set to true.
U11FSNKL0 : <@U11RM4ELV>: I'm not sure, I just tested using the web api instead of a webhook and it worked, not sure how to do it with a webhook...
U11RM4ELV : okay
U11FSNKL0 : <@U11RM4ELV>: I didn't try it, but what if you use the webhook sending to the channel: bot_id, but with the user token?
U0A16QMP0 : hey everyone, i wrote a post on slack bot analytics 101: <https://blog.zerobotlabs.com/slack-bot-analytics-101-1173c05d3bd7#.9o67ku8xb>
U0A16QMP0 : my lessons from setting up analytics for bots
U120R8V4Y : Hi!
U11H2RMTR : :wave:
U120R8V4Y : I'm currently looking into botkit and would like to use it as a "slack button" integration
U120R8V4Y : But as I'm developing the backend side on my own, I thought about handling the OAuth part in my backend instead of redirecting to the generated botkit routes
U120R8V4Y : Is there anyone having experience with this? I'm not sure how to pass the retrieved oauth data to botkit
U0YQS1FAR : I've done it <@U120R8V4Y>. There's an express example here <https://github.com/mvaragnat/botkit-express-demo>, but I implemented mine a little differently. Happy to answer any questions
U0YQS1FAR : To summarize, you will need to save the team/user after the oauth flow and then call spawn a new botkit instance for that team
U0YQS1FAR : There's also a <#C0AV5N8NA> channel, just fyi
U120R8V4Y : Thanks <@U0YQS1FAR> ! The problem is, that my backend is built with PHP using laravel
U120R8V4Y : Maybe I could store the credentials as you mentioned and then somehow trigger botkit to spawn a new instance
U0YQS1FAR : That's ok. The same concept will apply. You'll need a way to pass the Oauth data to your bot (Redis, RabbitMQ) etc
U120R8V4Y : This could be done through express, I guess
U120R8V4Y : Would the bot notice the oauth data, by just using redis? is there some kind of event that I could listen to with redis?
U0YQS1FAR : I'm using a pub sub and publishing an event. There are some events built in botkit that you could trigger though. `controller.trigger(‘create_bot`)` etc
U0TTN1XST : Assume many of y'all have seen this, but I just ran across this Medium post on slackbot analytics. Pretty cool stuff: <https://blog.zerobotlabs.com/slack-bot-analytics-101-1173c05d3bd7>
U122ST1PT : so I was invited to this and two other slack networks at the same time? :smile:
U122ST1PT : what's up with that
U04S3JCH2 : <@U122ST1PT>: short answer is that someone did some info scraping of another group and ran a script on the Slack groups with open access and caused a ton of invites to go out
U04S3JCH2 : most suspect it was an experiment gone wrong or someone poking at lax security around here :simple_smile:
U122ST1PT : ah
U122ST1PT : well thanks for clearing it up, I decided to join because why not :simple_smile:
U122ST1PT : meeting new people is never a bad thing to do :stuck_out_tongue:
U0HUTFBHS : Welcome!
U0G6ZCWES : yea welcome, this is a really good group.
U122ST1PT : what is it about anyways? :smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : :robot_face: bots!
U0CS6NSF5 : and :slack: dev :simple_smile:
U0K176R8A : hey friends, any idea why a bot wouldn't be able to edit / delete its own messages here? (we're randomly having this issue here and in a few other communities)
U0554MQJB : <@U0K176R8A>: depends on the team settings for time limits on editing messages. Some teams don't allow editing at all.
U0554MQJB : <@U0K176R8A>:   What percentage of teams does that occur for?
U11RM4ELV : <@U11FSNKL0>: thanks a lot!
U11RM4ELV : is there any way to pass extra argument in chat.postMessage method ??
U0K7Y2SK0 : Not sure what you mean, <@U11RM4ELV> - what are you trying to send that you cannot include already?
U0K7Y2SK0 : <@U0K176R8A>: Your bot will require elevated oAuth priviledges beyond normal bot token to do that.
U0K7Y2SK0 : *Then* you get to worry about team settings.
U0K176R8A : <@U0554MQJB> this one does though, I can still edit my own messages in <#C04SM6TAK> from ~10 days ago. But if you remember when Kifi did something weird in <#C0JV0QA4E> last week, our API calls that should have edited / deleted messages automatically were failing (`cant_delete_message`). 
The message is still there and I can reproduce the error actually: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/news/p1460440405000620>

U11RM4ELV : <@U0K7Y2SK0>: i need to pass some extra id from my database, so i can use it in next message
U11CQRTU0 : <@U11RM4ELV>: you can send the same as part of message right
U11RM4ELV : i don't want pass it in text parameter
U11CQRTU0 : If you are using Web API you can add any parameter yourself
U11CQRTU0 : Sorry I think I understand now
U11RM4ELV : yes i am using web api, but when i pass some extra parameter it will not shown in im.history method response
U11CQRTU0 : I think only way is to send it as part of text
U11CQRTU0 : may be text could be a json {id:&lt;id&gt;, text: text}
U0K7Y2SK0 : I'm not sure I understand your issue. Why can't your bot track the id internally, without reading it back from the chat?
U11CQRTU0 : <@U11RM4ELV> may be you can detail your use case
U11RM4ELV : ok
U11RM4ELV : i am creating scheduling bot
U11RM4ELV : so i have created on cron script that is run outside from slack and pass match schedule data from my database to slack custom bot through webhook
U11CQRTU0 : what is this id?
U11RM4ELV : this id is from my database
U11RM4ELV : id of one match record from my database
U11RM4ELV : so for example if user want to do some action on it, user can do by that id
U11CQRTU0 : okay
U11CQRTU0 : so you need this id as part of history ?
U124JH8F9 : uhhhhhhhhh, hi.
U124JH8F9 : sup?
U0K7Y2SK0 : And you can't make an API endpoint to your bot controller to store the ID's as they pass through to the webhook?
U0K7Y2SK0 : Cache and recall
U0K7Y2SK0 : Also hi <@U124JH8F9> :wave:
U11RM4ELV : <@U11CQRTU0>: yes as a part of history
U11RM4ELV : is there any other way??
U11RM4ELV : to recall on last message
U11RM4ELV : <@U0K7Y2SK0>: yes i can't control to store ID's as they pass through to the webhook
U11CQRTU0 : Why dont u want to have it as part of text ?
U11CQRTU0 : Any specific reasons?
U0K7Y2SK0 : I feel like I read something about passing data through how he's asking about once but can't find anything about it on slack API docs.
U0K7Y2SK0 : Maybe just ping their twitter and see? They're usually pretty responsive.
U11CQRTU0 : He wants to pass a parameter that will be part of history too
U11CQRTU0 : The only I way see it is having it as part of text (text as a json with id and text)
U11CQRTU0 : Can you refer what you read
U11CQRTU0 : ?
U0K7Y2SK0 : Yea I think so, too - but I have a foggy memory of a passthrough attribute and I don't remember if that was slack or another service.
U0K7Y2SK0 : Sorry I have no help to offer, and it's past my bedtime ha ha
U11CQRTU0 : okay
U0K7Y2SK0 : That seems like a nice thing to have though
U0K7Y2SK0 : And if it doesn't exist
U11CQRTU0 : Ya true
U0K7Y2SK0 : Someone should add it
U124JH8F9 : so I have a question for you guys on admin permissions and bots
U124JH8F9 : I'd like to give my bot access to some of the methods that require admin level permissions
U124JH8F9 : more specifically, `chat.delete`
U124JH8F9 : but i think im getting hung up around the point in the oauth flow when you get a code after authenticating and then trade it in for a new access token
U124JH8F9 : is the exchange of the code for a new access token, setting and storing said access token, and then using the token in `bot.api` calls
U124JH8F9 : is that stuff all handled behind the scenes by botkit? or do i need to take care of that stuff and be explicit when making api calls that require a token with specific permissions?
U0HBN0L9M : <@U124JH8F9>: the token is stored by botkit when you activate the bot
U0HBN0L9M : you pass a token to instantiate the bot
U0HBN0L9M : it is automatically added to bot.api calls
U124JH8F9 : wait, are you the same matthieu who's working on the shopify alogolia integration?
U0QTSKUH2 : <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/general/p1461054760000358>
I contacted Slack using a help ticket and they said they do not merge messages if the `username` differs, the same doesn't apply to `icon_url` though.

U0HBN0L9M : <@U124JH8F9> not me
U0HBN0L9M : I worked with Algolia, I worked with Shopify
U0HBN0L9M : but not at integrating them :simple_smile:
U124JH8F9 : damn, i never thought I'd meet more than one matthieu in my life
U0HBN0L9M : common name in :fr:
U124JH8F9 : really?
U124JH8F9 : it's a pretty cool way to spell a name
U0HBN0L9M : I never had less than 2 Matthieu (or Mathieu) in my classrooms
U124JH8F9 : lol
U124JH8F9 : i guess it's really the same thing as matthew in teh US
U0HBN0L9M : yep
U0HBN0L9M : und Matthias
U0HBN0L9M : etc
U123SGBU3 : Hi guys! Hope you are all well.
I'm trying to get one of the example bots working, however,  I can't seem to get connected to the RTM API:

`notice: ** BOT ID: planysbot ...attempting to connect to RTM!`

Any idea what can be going on here?

U124JH8F9 : probably gonna need a little more context
U123SGBU3 : I've just downloaded Botkit onto my mac, with the conversation bot, stuck in the Bot Token
U123SGBU3 : ```  planysbot node planysbot
info: ** No persistent storage method specified! Data may be lost when process shuts down.
info: ** Setting up custom handlers for processing Slack messages
info: ** API CALL: <https://slack.com/api/rtm.start>
notice: ** BOT ID: planysbot ...attempting to connect to RTM!
```

U124JH8F9 : so you changed no code inside of the conversation bot?
U124JH8F9 : also <@U0HBN0L9M> or anyone, do you know if botkit simplifies exchanging and storing a returned auth_code for an updated access token to attach to a user?
U124JH8F9 : do i need to keep track of access tokens for all users if I want to delete messages on behalf of them? or can i just get an admin to give the bot permission to delete everyone else's messages with one super token?
U123SGBU3 : all i done was hardcode my bots token
U123SGBU3 : instead of reading it from env
U124JH8F9 : is there another console.log after ```notice: ** BOT ID: planysbot ...attempting to connect to RTM!```
U123SGBU3 : no, it just kind of hangs there
U124JH8F9 : hmmmm
U0HBN0L9M : <@U124JH8F9>: botkit can handle the auth process for you
