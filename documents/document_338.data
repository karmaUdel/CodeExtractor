U3KSN5MAL : What am i doing wrong here :confused:?
U3KSN5MAL : can't work out how to feed the information correctly into arrayAsTuple
U3SJEDR96 : You can just use `arrayAsTuple3 (index 0 int) (...) (..)` there.
U3KSN5MAL : ah
U3KSN5MAL : perfect
U3SJEDR96 : Of you can change the tupledecoder so that it will do the indexing by itself (by "wrapping" the decoders with the relevant `index x`), so you could just call `arrastup3 int int string` or whatever :)
U3KSN5MAL : ah ok
U3KSN5MAL : thank you!
U3SJEDR96 : (on mobile so being a little terse, sorry ;))
U3KSN5MAL : dude, hero, no sweat
U3KSN5MAL : ok hopefully last bit of trouble shooting then i should be good. 
```		var storedState = localStorage.getItem('LumaPanel');
	var startingState = storedState ? JSON.parse(storedState) : null;


	var node = document.getElementById('main');
	var app = Elm.Main.fullscreen(startingState);```

U3KSN5MAL : so this is how i pass in the pre parsed json currently, but now i need to pass it in as a Json.value right? Do i pass it in as a maybe or do i try and check if it's a maybe inside the decoder?
U61JQ4F4J : Another question, is <https://github.com/TheSeamau5/elm-router> still the way to go for routing?
U61JQ4F4J : I don't think so since it has more than 2 years without updates :confused:
U61JQ4F4J : seems like it should be this one right? <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/navigation/2.1.0>
U5GJ5FEAU : <@U61JQ4F4J> yes! `elm-lang/navigation` should be the way to go
U3KSN5MAL : Ok, got that working, but now having a lil trouble parsing this data. 
```
parsing failed: "Expecting an object with a field named `pickerHeight` but instead got: \"{
\\\"pickerMode\\\":3,
\\\"activeColor\\\":[1,1,1],
\\\"sliderOptions\\\":{
				\\\"rgbo\\\":true,
				\\\"rgbl\\\":false,
				\\\"hsvo\\\":false,
				\\\"hsvl\\\":true},
\\\"colorMode\\\":1,
\\\"lights\\\":[{
	\\\"color\\\":[1,1,1],
	\\\"isOn\\\":true,
	\\\"bitMask\\\":0,
	\\\"editMode\\\":false,
	\\\"editText\\\":false,
	\\\"name\\\":\\\"default\\\",
	\\\"id\\\":0}],
\\\"uid\\\":0,
\\\"lid\\\":1,
\\\"lightPacks\\\":[],
\\\"pickerHeight\\\":0.3702000000000001}\""```

U3KSN5MAL : The field it's saying is missing is present, so i'm sure the error is something else
U3KSN5MAL : any ideas for what i can look at to find the problem?
U153UK3FA : <@U3KSN5MAL> what's with all the slashes?
U3SJEDR96 : <@U3KSN5MAL> the code you have on the JS side was fine, only the elm side had to change :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : I'm guessing you removed the `JSON.parse`?
U3SJEDR96 : I'd go for: `JSON.parse` on the JS side, and passing the resulting object in through flags. On the Elm side, that means you'd take `Json.Encode.Value` as your flags type, and use `Json.Decode.decodeValue` on it to get a `Result String something`
U3KSN5MAL : yeah i got that part working
U3KSN5MAL : sorry should have posted
U3SJEDR96 : yeah, the slashes seem to indicate you're trying to run `decodeValue` on a JS string, basically
