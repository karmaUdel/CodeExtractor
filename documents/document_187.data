U0R0325UN : Bummer <@U0NMBPTRT> - hope this gets changed as it makes on-demand bots a lot less fun when you're away from home
U0F9T9KPH : Was curious how everyone is handling testing on the Slack side. Is everyone doing it manually or is there some great tool I can't find?
U0GT29N3A : <@U0F9T9KPH>: A dedicated team for testing, mocking the slack API is not really easy so...
U0F9T9KPH : Someone should totally do that. Ha.
U0AFABJAJ : <@U0F9T9KPH>: We stub out the API calls using WebMock (if you are using Ruby)
U0DSTH2HL : hey <@U0R28TKNC> welcome!
U0CNYC404 : <@U0R0325UN>: We do it by allowing the user to update their location by telling us and then remembering it until they update it again (and of course, letting them override it in a request if required)
U0KECURAT : <@U0R0325UN>: you could always cover the most often cases by letting a user set aliases to locations like work and home etc
U0D1UMSV6 : Wow, that "tell me about new things" icon is EXACTLY like the notification you get when someone mentioned you in a channel. I just spent a long time searching for the mention when I realized it was telling me some new feature.

U0M7BVC3D : does anyone have some sample code for kicking off a conversation with a slash command (using botkit)?
U0M7BVC3D : here's what I tried```
controller.on('slash_command',function(bot,message) {

  console.log(message);

  bot.startRTM(function(err,message) {

    if (!err) {
      trackBot(bot);
    }

    bot.startConversation(message,function(err,convo,message) {

      console.log(message);
      convo.ask(‘Ready?',[
        {
          pattern: bot.utterances.yes,
          callback: function(response,convo) {
            convo.say('Great! I will continue...');
            askFlavor(response, convo);
            convo.next();
          },
        },
        {
          pattern: <http://bot.utterances.no|bot.utterances.no>,
          callback: function(response,convo) {
            convo.say('I\'ll be waiting.');
            convo.stop();
          }
        }
      ]);

    });

  });
```

U0M7BVC3D : feels wrong, lol, works once and throws a timeout error, but the conversation will start
U0HBN0L9M : you're actually starting the RTM within the slash command
U0HBN0L9M : I'm not sure what bot is return by the controller
U0HBN0L9M : feels wrong :smile:
U0QJJQA2D : hi hello, I'm finding a tool to make a demo of bot easily, like this <http://kipthis.com/chat> if you know about it, please tell me

U0QTE8Y69 : holy moly batman… there is 138 channels in this group!!
U04SM6T2H : <@U0M7BVC3D>: you can't really do that.
U04SM6T2H : <@U0M7BVC3D>: you should ask in <#C0AV5N8NA>
U0D7LHNTX : Hey party people. I bet you'll like this:<https://api.slack.com/docs/formatting/builder>

U04S1QCPC : <https://twitter.com/SlackAPI/status/707291678961324034>
U04SM6T2H : I WAS JUST GONNA LINK THAT!
U0D7LHNTX : dammit sean
U04SM6T2H : haha
U04S3JCH2 : extremely helpful <@U04S1QCPC>!
U0M7BVC3D : <@U04SM6T2H>: ok, you and I talked about this before… just getting back to this project, I'll move to <#C0AV5N8NA>
U04S1QCPC : worth noting that the message builder goes through our regular message processing code, so it'll look like what people see in slack even if we update slack in the future (assuming they have default settings on).
U0HBN0L9M : :+1:
U0JFU556K : yay!
U0GPKTHQ9 : <@U04S1QCPC> ahhh awesome :+1: thanks
U0JPS3SHX : hey <@U0D7LHNTX> <@U04S1QCPC> looks like messages are always with `response_type: in_channel` would be good to be able to preview the ephemeral
U0D7LHNTX : <@U0JPS3SHX>: There are subtle differences among the different mechanisms for sending messages. For the moment, we are focused on incoming webhooks, although the resulting message will be usable via other means as well (which is why we don't bring this fact up). Going forward, we'll be working hard to improve this tool for every use case. This is really excellent feedback!
U0JPS3SHX : thanks <@U0D7LHNTX> having this tool is already a great improvement, really happy with that
U0D7LHNTX : :bow: And thank you!!
U0RDALRU0 : is it acceptable for a bot to message every member of a slack team only once when it's first added, to give basic instructions?
U0GQ2JCCA : probably acceptable
U0GQ2JCCA : but i imagine a lot of people would be annoyed
U0GQ2JCCA : and not the best for huge teams
U0RDALRU0 : ok thanks
U04SM6T2H : I would say that wuold be very annoying
U04SM6T2H : Bots should only message people after being messaged
U04SM6T2H : or on behalf of someone (like if I say go talk to <@U0RDALRU0> its ok)
U0RDALRU0 : yeah that makes sense
U0GPSB7V1 : you could have the bot ask the person who integrated it whether it should introduce itself
U0GPSB7V1 : or the bot could ask the admins to introduce for it by giving them something to cut and paste
U0GQ2JCCA : true, like slackbot does on calls
U0GQ2JCCA : something like this <https://i.imgur.com/51GRzGN.png>
U0GPSB7V1 : yeah i think growbot does it that way too
U0MUZB415 : Is there a way to track that someone has uninstalled your bot?
U0GT29N3A : Has something changed regarding inviting users to a channel? Now I get a 'not_in_channel' error (when the token holder is not in the channel and tries to invite someone else), but I always reckon it used to work.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0GT29N3A>: it didn't
U0GT29N3A : <@U0CS6NSF5>: oh lah, my beliefs were wrong all this time then :stuck_out_tongue: thanks for confirming :simple_smile:
U0MUZB415 : Dev questions: Is there a way to track that someone has uninstalled your bot?
U0RDALRU0 : i would store the tokens and run a script to routinely check if auth still works or if it's invalid, that's the only way we've found on our end
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0GT29N3A>: np :simple_smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0MUZB415>: checking whether the access token is still active
U0CS6NSF5 : you can use `/api/auth.test`
U0RA090RW : Hi, Is there anyone who is familiar with howdy botkit? I am using that as the base code to develop an application as I am new to slack. I have a requirement to keep the bot online 24*7. I am noticing a behavior, the bot goes offline even when the script is still running with no console messages being logged about the failure. I have tried running the script in background to make sure that the connection is persistent. Even with that the bot was up only for two hours and went down on its own. Could anyone please suggest something on this issue.
U0RDALRU0 : it might be related to Slack websocket disconnect we've been experiencing sometimes, where we have to restart the server on websocket disconnect, not sure since we don't use botkit
U0RDALRU0 : <https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-client/issues/53>
U0RA090RW : ok. So, could you please guide me with the right way to achieve this functionality in other cases where we can make the bot be online all the time.
U0RDALRU0 : this is not best practice as covered in that github conversation, but we wait for a websocket `close` event and restart the server. the next step for this will be to just re-connect just the slack team related to the websocket `close` event to avoid server restart
U0RA090RW : I did not understand the second  part of your reply. Could you please clarify.
U0RDALRU0 : in this example event: `slackUsers[user.team_id].on('close', function(res) { })` we restart the server now, but we will eventually link the `user.team_id` to the `close` event and just `open` a new socket for that specific team
U0RDALRU0 : Is it possible for bots to download images sent by users through slack? It seems that bots dont have `file:read` permissions, or has someone figured out how? We're trying to do some deep vision stuff
U0RA090RW : Thanks for clarifying <@U0RDALRU0>.  I will try this solution. :simple_smile:
U0GT29N3A : <@U0RDALRU0>: here's a slice of discussion talking about `files:read` for bot users <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/bots/p1456299312000025>
U0RDALRU0 : <@U0GT29N3A>: that's fantastic, thank you!
U0HBN0L9M : Hey people, happy to demo our new app Roundtable in channel <#C0RF4BSKX> ! It's a *management-free reporting* app, meaning that everybody can add projects they're working on and share updates with the team. Since we're all working on various, interesting projects, it might be cool to see what's everybody up to :simple_smile:
U0GPSB7V1 : i was excited that the Slack Variety Pack talked about pomodoro technique.  made me wish i had finished and launched my pomodoro bot!
U0D7LHNTX : Just in case you hadn't seen:
U0D7LHNTX : <https://twitter.com/slackapi/status/707643025049018369>
U0D7LHNTX : (I'll be there of course!)
U0HUZ214H : I really wish I could attend, but I'm across the country. Would be awesome if it will be livestreamed or at minimum someone just periscoping it. Is there a chance?
U0D7LHNTX : I am indeed going to try to stream it <@U0HUZ214H> 
U0HUZ214H : Thank you! Will add to calendar.
U0RRCPDK9 : Hey fellas :wave: really glad to be here :simple_smile:
U0GPSB7V1 : welcome!
U0RDALRU0 : is there a way to get the name of the user who authenticated / added your bot to Slack? i saw that adding calls to Slack does this, when they first message just you on the team
U0AFABJAJ : <@U0RDALRU0>: You can get the name if you use a `user:read` scope when you authenticate. It will come back in a `user_info` node on the json
U0RDALRU0 : thank you <@U0AFABJAJ> !
U0AFABJAJ : np
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0RDALRU0>: do you want the full name or the nick name?
U0CS6NSF5 : the nick name and user id you can get from `auth.test` with the `identify` scope
U0AFABJAJ : Yes. If you don't have `users:read`, the name will be nil in `info` node…the tradeoff is that your app has to ask for an additional scope
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0AFABJAJ>: if they are provisioning a `bot`, the bot already has `users:read` though, so no need for that scope in the user token, they can just check the details based on the user id from `auth.test` with the user token and check the user details with the bot token
U0AFABJAJ : <@U0CS6NSF5>: Yes…I did not know that is what you were trying to get at :+1:
U0CS6NSF5 : depends on the details they need and the scopes they are currently asking for, just mentioning other ways :simple_smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : they might not need any extra scopes from what they already have
U0AFABJAJ : Yeah…if you wanted email for example, you would have to use `users:read` though, correct?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0AFABJAJ>: not if you have a bot access token
U0CS6NSF5 : since `bot` includes `users:read` already
U0AFABJAJ : Oh! Awesome….I did not know that…I though `auth.test` was limiting
U0AFABJAJ : Thanks <@U0CS6NSF5>
U0HBN0L9M : Quick summary of the first France Slack meetup yesterday
U0HBN0L9M : <https://medium.com/@MVaragnat/slack-apps-best-practices-use-cases-dff1d0fe7889#.n7h2v574l>
U0RA090RW : <@U0RDALRU0> I tried the solution you had mentioned to handle the websocket connection issue, but the bot still went down after 12 hours. All the events of the connection are handled now. Do you have any other suggestion on this?
U0RDALRU0 : what framework are you using for slack auth?  <@U0RA090RW>
U0RA090RW : I have the code in Node.js
U0HQA1MLJ : Hey folks, has anyone stumbled upon a sports-focused Bot?  Are there really none, or is my eyesight failing?
U04S0AG48 : I have heard of a couple in the works ¯\_(?)_/¯
U0GPSB7V1 : <@U0HQA1MLJ>: the ESPN API is only available to “partners” :disappointed:
U0PJ9ANR0 : howdy, I am getting an "not_authed" error when using an owner's token - any chance that this is an oversight (that only "admins" can execute certain apis)?
U0PJ9ANR0 : it is for the undocumented invite api
U06E352LU : <@U0HQA1MLJ>:  what type of data are you interested in? they are other sources than ESPN… but yeah sports data is usually $$$$
U0HUZ214H : <@U0HQA1MLJ>: I developed DraftBot a bot that kets you get DraftKing's salary lists by league and/or position and lets you search by player name to get their PPG and salary, but I took it down to retool, not to mention I was ready to launch it for multiple teams right when all the negative PR hit. So DraftBot is laying low for a couple of days.
U0HUZ214H : <@U0GPSB7V1>: I looked at that API too. That and the Fantasy Sports API which has a hefty usage charge. No thanks. Plenty of free APIs out there to coalesce into useful insight instead!
U0CSBGTKM : <https://github.com/stattleship/glickman>
U0CSBGTKM : played with this a bit
U0CSBGTKM : kinda neat
U0HQA1MLJ : Thanks, <@U0CSBGTKM>!  It does look really interesting--I missed these folks.
U0HQA1MLJ : <@U06E352LU>, <@U0GPSB7V1>: We actually have all the data, I've just been surprised not to find any bots out there yet.  Ours will be out next week.
U0HQA1MLJ : <@U0HUZ214H>: Have faith--DFS isn't dead yet...
U0HUZ214H : Thanks <@U0HQA1MLJ> for keeping my hopes up! Only reason I built it is that I had just built a similar tool as a DraftKings Salary Tooltip Google Chrome Browser Extension and was so excited by the DOM, I landed here. And the only reason I built that was because a friend and I had created the Draft Duel Cast Podcast, and needed another growth hack to promote it. And the only reason I built... I'm not even that much of a sportsfan anymore. I'm a Bot Fan.
U0NRCM9BN : good evening.someone knows if an app keeps the same id regardless the team?

U0NRCM9BN : <@U0D7LHNTX>: can you help me with this?
U0LP7NBPH : the app id is for the app
U0LP7NBPH : api token for the team
U0D7LHNTX : That's exactly right. ClientIds are issued per app. Tokens are issued per team. <@U0NRCM9BN> DM me if you have more questions, happy to help out!!
U0D7LHNTX : For those who haven't signed up yet, I've expanded the RSVP list for the SF Slack Developer Meetup! Come get inspired to build awesome bots :robot_face: with talks from the teams behind the amazing Firewatch :fire:, <http://api.ai|api.ai>, and ToyTalk! <http://www.meetup.com/SlackDevs/events/229351740/>
U0SDZFGCX : Hi everyone
U0SDZFGCX : thanks for accepting me
U0SDZFGCX : I'm building an app that contains a bot + slash commands and I have a question
U0SDZFGCX : when I type /mycommand #anyChannel
U0SDZFGCX : I don't receive the channel id in the message sent to my end point
U0SDZFGCX : is it the expected behavior? everytime I'm given a channel from a user, I have to call the api and look it up to get the id?
U0SDZFGCX : also, how can I look it up? api is expecting a channel id
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0SDZFGCX>, `/api/channels.list` will give you a the list of channels
U0D77S71S : Does `AIML` underly most chatbots out there?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0D77S71S>: regular expressions probably underly most chatbots out there right now :stuck_out_tongue:
U0D77S71S : But it is essentially some form of storing patterns to search against, right?
U0CS6NSF5 : I would bet most people just have patterns embedded in the code rather than storing it in something like AIML or anything like that
U0CS6NSF5 : e.g: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit#matching-patterns-and-keywords-with-hears>
U0CS6NSF5 : specially since most people are not looking at i18n, which would push you towards a catalog of patterns
U0D77S71S : Ok, interesting thanks!  I have been playing around with storing the patterns and responses in a DB/static JSON file
U0SDZFGCX : <@U0CS6NSF5>: thanks! you suggest I store a local copy of the list to avoid making a call every tiem and call the api only when I get an unexpected channel?
U0SDZFGCX : also, are channel ids unique across slack or just across 1 team?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0SDZFGCX>, if you are making the request from your bot connection, you should keep the list cached in memory and updated with the RTM events anyway, otherwise you *could* keep a cache, but depends on the use case since users can rename/delete channels
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0SDZFGCX>, you should store IDs alongside the team ID, they are currently unique across Slack, but might not be in the future
U0SDZFGCX : thank you for your answers!
U0SDZFGCX : very helpful
U0SDZFGCX : :+1:
U0CS6NSF5 : my pleasure
U0PKKDY1Z : Hello! Would anyone here be interested in testing out a bot I'm working on? It's a Slack bot meets live-blogging tool meets Twitter-esque social network. DM me if you're interested!
U06E352LU : Does anybody has experience writing slack bots using <http://Chatbots.io|Chatbots.io> / Pandorabots? thx
U0NM0SL10 : I do, I wrote one of the original AIML specs
U06E352LU : <@U0NM0SL10>: awesome, how was the experience? where you able to call other APIs on it? So the answers are dynamic?
U0NM0SL10 : Do you mean something like what is described here: <http://pandorabots.github.io/articles/dynamicdata/>
U06E352LU : <@U0NM0SL10>: looks like I was looking for
U0GPKTHQ9 : I built something you all might find useful :simple_smile:
U0GPKTHQ9 : <https://slackrank.xyz/>
U0GPKTHQ9 : A ranking of all the apps on the slack directory
U0GT29N3A : <@U0GPKTHQ9>: Ohh nice, really useful, indeed. How does it work? Is there enough apps in multiple categories to determine the ranking or are you using some kind of hidden API?
U0GPKTHQ9 : <@U0GT29N3A>: That was my initial thought, but it doesn't work very well at all. haha
U0GPKTHQ9 : no hidden API, but there is a way :wink:
U0H0S3E69 : Does anyone have blog posts or other info on people talking about monetizing slack apps? If someone has info they don't want to share publicly, they can PM me.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0H0S3E69>: you can search the archives, there has been some talks on payments in the past
U0H0S3E69 : Do we have unlimited message history in this channel or only 10k?
U0CS6NSF5 : unlimited
U0H0S3E69 : nice, I'll go through and search
U0CS6NSF5 : if you have some concrete questions just ask
U0H0S3E69 : I was looking for my next startup idea and wondering if a slack app based business can be a primary income driver for a 1-2 person dev shop
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0H0S3E69>: it's possible, yes
U0CSJUB1D : <@U0CS6NSF5> How is this channel unlimited? Is that just a <#C04SM6TAK> thing I didn't know about? 
U0D7LHNTX : No, Slack is paying for this team :stuck_out_tongue:
U0D7LHNTX : Or someone is.
U0CSJUB1D : Had a feeling. Thanks SlackHq 
U0JPS3SHX : <@U0D7LHNTX>: is the meetup going to be online today?
U0D7LHNTX : YES
U0D7LHNTX : <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/sf-meetup/p1457981240000009>
U0NM0SL10 : What time (EST) does that stream start?
U0554MQJB : <@U0GPKTHQ9>: are the ranking based on actual bot activity in slack teams or install count? Why is Slackbot itself so low?
U0GPKTHQ9 : <@U0554MQJB>: The metric is number of authed teams from what I can tell. This data comes directly from Slack. I am not doing any data processing of any kind :simple_smile:
U0GPKTHQ9 : and regarding slackbot, I think that integration (<https://slack.com/apps/A0F81R8ET-slackbot>) doesn't refer to the actual slackbot, but rather to "Slackbot responses" that you can configure
U0GPKTHQ9 : so teams that don't have slackbot responses set up wouldn't count
U0GPKTHQ9 : but that's just an assumption ¯\_(?)_/¯
U0GPKTHQ9 : woo Livestream is live :simple_smile: :tada:
U0SNHMK7U : nice!
U0HUZ214H : Thanks so much <@U0D7LHNTX> ! Been looking forward to that all weekend. Also saw I missed a <@U0HCTU26A> meetup. Hope there was footage of that too!
U0HUZ214H : Did I just hear more reaction buttons on the Roadmap?! Nice!
U0JPS3SHX : Yep
U0JPS3SHX : I think reactions are coming
U0HUZ214H : Thanks <@U0D7LHNTX> and <@U04SS2NBF> and the ToyTalk peeps! That was great!
U0R2U31DL : Thanks <@U0D7LHNTX> for organizing the meetup. Also thanks to <@U04SS2NBF>, <@U0L7B9Y8G>, Ben Burbank and Toy Talk's Lucas Ives. Good learning from them. Great to hear that the Slack Platform roadmap is open.. and accepting feature requests :+1:
U0SPL29DG : Herp derp
U0RDALRU0 : We wrote about our process of designing chat for commerce :simple_smile: <https://medium.com/@kipsearch/designing-chat-for-commerce-9faf1e36c040>
U0HBN0L9M : I added Kip by <@U0RDALRU0> to Product Hunt - show them some :heart: !<https://www.producthunt.com/tech/kip-2>

U0SQ5NC0J : Hi all, Is controller.storage.users.all not suppose to update when a new user enters the team? Just curious if this is intended and if there is a way to get an updated list
U0RRCPDK9 : hey fellas - just wanted to ask about great resources for bot creators. I'm collecting them at <http://thebotiquette.tumblr.com|thebotiquette.tumblr.com>. Let me know if there's anything I should share!
U0SDZFGCX : <@U0CS6NSF5>: what is the best way to update app's permissions? how can I update my app scopes?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0SDZFGCX>, depends, do you want a new set of scopes for all new users or just for those who want extra permissions?
U0SDZFGCX : both users who already installed and new ones
U0SDZFGCX : I guess new ones I can just update the scopes in the “add to slack button"
U0SDZFGCX : what about users who already installed the app?
U0CS6NSF5 : previous users will have to go through the authorisation again to grant you the extra scopes
U0SQ075S4 : Is it possible to interact with the user by giving them options? I want to something like when slackbot reminds me, I can interact with the reminder by "Marking it done", or remind me Tomorrow
U0GQ2JCCA : the options like slackbot gives, is that what you're asking?
U0GQ2JCCA : where you just click on the text and it does a certain thing? <@U0SQ075S4>
U0SQ075S4 : <@U0GQ2JCCA>,  Yes, just like that
U0GQ2JCCA : unfortunately, that doesn't exist in slack just yet, but the team @ slack is aware and i believe they're thinking about/working on it
U0GQ2JCCA : the closest you could get is using emoji reactions or making a web page that handles that action
U0GQ2JCCA : <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/botkit/p1457555580001415>
U0HBN0L9M : they announced at the meetup that they'll give that option
U0HBN0L9M : I mean it's on their roadmap
U0GQ2JCCA : and if you click on that link there was a little bit more conversation about that same thing :simple_smile:
U0GQ2JCCA : <@U0HBN0L9M>: oh they did?
U0GQ2JCCA : that's exciting
U0GQ2JCCA : is there an archive/recording of that meetup anywhere btw?
U0SQ075S4 : I did look at reactions to emojis, but the real deal would be better. Do their roadmap have a timeline?
U0HBN0L9M : ask <@U0D7LHNTX>
U0D7LHNTX : No, we can't offer a concrete timeline, except to say that this is something we are actively working on and super excited about :smile:
U0HUZ214H : I threw my two cents in :simple_smile: <@U0HBN0L9M> <@U0RDALRU0>
U0MUZB415 : Is there a way to give access to slack application to multiple developers?
U0MUZB415 : Or is it restricted to the app owner?
U0PV6RU9H : hey folks, what's the best channel for technical questions? Posted in <#C04SX7RLD> last night but it seems a bit low activity :simple_smile:
U0MUZB415 : this one
U0MUZB415 : or at least it has been for me
U0MUZB415 : Anyone know the answer to this? That's a huge road block right now :disappointed:&gt; Is there a way to give access to slack application to multiple developers?

U0HBN0L9M : What do you mean ?
U0HBN0L9M : access to the panel on <http://api.slack.com|api.slack.com> ?
U0PV6RU9H : if you mean access to the application settings (e.g. name, icon, redirect_uri), I haven't found one
U0PV6RU9H : Hi there! 
Quick question: is there a correct way to handle `&amp;` in the `author_name` 

If I type `&amp;` in my input it gets encoded as `&amp;amp;`. But if I type `&amp;amp;` it doesn't get decoded.

for example: <https://api.slack.com/docs/formatting/builder?msg=%7B%22text%22%3A%22I%20am%20a%20test%20message%20http%3A%2F%2Fslack.com%22%2C%22attachments%22%3A%5B%7B%22author_name%22%3A%22Abercrombie%20%26amp%3B%20Fitch%22%2C%22author_icon%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Flogo.clearbit.com%2Fmadkudu.com%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Abercrombie%20%26amp%3B%20Fitch%22%7D%5D%7D>

U0D7LHNTX : Howdy! I have a random question. Is anyone here based out of, or know anyone developing on Slack that is based out of Toronto?
U0D7LHNTX : <@U0MUZB415>: <@U0PV6RU9H> is right. There isn't a mechanism for that. For the moment, apps are owned by single indivuduals
U0KH2JKB5 : Hmm, hopefully this guy doesn't write an app; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Baxter%26>
U0KH2JKB5 : is funny because ampersand. :disappointed:
U0SSVS33N : <@U0D7LHNTX>: I'm in Toronto, but only developing purely ridiculous things.
U0D7LHNTX : <@U0SSVS33N>: moving to DM
U0HQA1MLJ : Hey folks, we're about to launch our sports-focused app.  We're handling scores, news, social, and TV listings--I'd love any feedback you have time to give.<http://ruwtbot.com>

U0DSTH2HL : hey <@U0HQA1MLJ> oo nice! I still love my RUWT alerts. :simple_smile:
U0HQA1MLJ : <@U0DSTH2HL>: Thanks, stranger!  Hope all is well...
U0T122ZUJ : Hello Friends. I am developing a payments app for Slack, which requires authenticating the user (validating the user credentials against backend) every time a transaction is done via slack. I am trying to figure out what is the best way to authenticate. Asking the user to include password as slash command argument is not a good idea because it is typed in the an open text field (password not hidden as you type). Do you have any suggestion regarding how to handle passwords in slack apps?

U0D7LHNTX : (That would also be a violation of the Slack TOS!)
U0D7LHNTX : I have a couple of thoughts on this. The first is that you can use Slack as a source of authentication in itself. (The OAuth flow is pretty suitable as an authentication mechanism as-is. Improvements to this mechanism are in the works!)
U0D7LHNTX : But you probably also want authorization. This can be…for now…accomplished by providing a link for the user to click on.
U0D7LHNTX : I'd be happy to talk more about this over DM!
U0CS6NSF5 : or do 2-factor auth: send an SMS with details of the transaction and a one-time code to be entered via slash commands
U0CS6NSF5 : the OAuth flow has it's drawbacks: you cannot force to identify a user in particular, and the user might be already authenticated in the browser which would get around any auth
U0CS6NSF5 : I would probably go with 2-factor auth (authentication+authorization) or a link requiring authentication and authorization
U0CS6NSF5 : Stripe checkout does SMS confirmation when saving the CC details too, if I remember correctly, rather than relying on passwords
U0SDZFGCX : Hi everyone!
U0SDZFGCX : I'm building a slash command, and when it's called on a private chat between 2 people, I get ‘directmessage' as channel name. Is there a way to retrieve both users of that private chat via channel id?
U0SDZFGCX : I'll give an example to clarify
U0SDZFGCX : A is direct messaging B, A decides to run my slash command in that channel, can I somehow retrieve B's username?
U0HNAA1GU : you could try <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.info> It has members listed as one of the attributes returned.

U0SDZFGCX : I don't think DM are included in the list
U0SDZFGCX : I tried through the api tester and I got invalid channel
U0SDZFGCX : but thanks for the suggestion :simple_smile:
U0HNAA1GU : don't you get the channel id?
U0SDZFGCX : yes I do, but I don't the api treat channel ids belonging to DM the same as a true channel #something
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0SDZFGCX>: check `<http://ims.info|ims.info>`
U0SDZFGCX : is it an undocumented api?
U0SDZFGCX : I've tried to call the endpoint and I get that I need the read scope
U0SDZFGCX : when I add read to my current scopes I get Cannot request service scope (commands) with deprecated scopes
U0CS6NSF5 : @enric, sorry, `im.list` but you'll need to use the user access token to see their IMs
U0SDZFGCX : is there a way to get a token for a room? Or I have to ask every single user to grant me permission?
U0CS6NSF5 : when the user uses the command, if you need some permissions, you can send them a link to grant you permission and get the token
U0SDZFGCX : also I created another user and I noticed that channel ids for DMs are different based on the user
U0SDZFGCX : I see your point and I thank you for the suggestion. I think I'll change my command workflow to ask the user who is talking to
U0CS6NSF5 : the only thing you can rely on about those IDs is the prefix being `D` for IMs, `C` for public channels, and `G` for private ones
U0SDZFGCX : I was expecting the channel id for a DM to be the same for both users involved
U0CS6NSF5 : yes, I mean regarding the format of the ID, and any patterns you might identify
U0CS6NSF5 : don't parse channel IDs beyond checking the firs character
U0SDZFGCX : yep, thanks
U0SDZFGCX : can I at least expect them to be consistent? will a message sent in this channel have always the same channel id?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0SDZFGCX>, I think so
U0SDZFGCX : my app  heavily relies on that assumption, I hope so :smile:
U055FHACC : Suggested mission for Slack 2016: Replicate <@U0CS6NSF5> 's functionality into Slackbot :simple_smile:
U0SDZFGCX : :+1:
U0CS6NSF5 : xD
U055FHACC : ha! and why is “bot” highlighted there?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U055FHACC>, it's a conversation over <https://slackline.io/shared_channels/golang> :simple_smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : so they read me often and with a `bot` tag XD
U055FHACC : how many instances of you are deployed?
U0CS6NSF5 : have lost count xD
U0CS6NSF5 : 48 community channels in Slackline + all the private shared channels with friends, customers, etc.
U0SMQ77D1 : might interest you all: <https://medium.com/@rob_ellis/creating-a-chat-bot-42861e6a2acd#.gsdehm4mz>
U0HPZF95H : Thanks for Sharing <@U0SMQ77D1>  I wrote that a long time ago :simple_smile:
U0PJ9ANR0 : struggling to get the unofficial invite api working, is an admin around who can help?
U07HXFWUD : is anyone here based in China? FYI slack works, kind of.
U0NJH5FBR : Hi all, thought some of you here might be interested .. As mentioned earlier this week at <#C0LDY2E2X|sf-meetup>, if you want to build conversational bots with personality, now you can with PullString, which enables chat bot creation simply and easily!Check out <https://pullstring.ai> for more information and beta email signup. 

U055FHACC : <@U0NJH5FBR>: that's interesting. Is it built on Toytalk assets?
U0NJH5FBR : Hi <@U055FHACC> ... I think the answer to your question is yes, but let me clarify. Are you referring to the core NLP and AI systems and code? Yes, those are ToyTalk's.  Or maybe you meant something else by "assets"?
U055FHACC : yes I meant to ask if it's built on top of your existing code. very cool 
U0TFMHQ66 : hey my example bot gets stuck on BOT ID: standup_please ...attempting to connect to RTM!
U0TFMHQ66 : using <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/examples/demo_bot.js> as a library
U0SSVS33N : I haven't run that example, but I don't think it would be unusual for that to be the last thing you see in the console after starting it
U0SSVS33N : does it not respond to any of its triggers?
U0SSVS33N : (I mean, you should eventually see other log output, but if it's just started and sitting there waiting, that looks normal to me)
U0TFNC8HE : great library!
U0TFNC8HE : by the way is going fine
U0G6ZCWES : Hi everyone, I wrote a Medium article about a fun hack I created to monitor our Slack user's experiences, if you find it interesting or useful (or just wanna help) please like it!  <https://medium.com/@MarketSpace/using-slack-to-monitor-your-integration-cb7fd3229265#.1iyoaw2dy>

U0THPLS7L : hello Friends, is it possible to use slack attachments (to format/style responses) with the botkit API?  Cant find it anywhere in bot.reply or convo.say methods. Thanks
U0HBN0L9M : yes, it is possible
U0HBN0L9M : you have a few examples in the readme
U0LFF0WSF : <@U0THPLS7L>: Yes, in fact I just did this today. Use something like:
```convo.say({
    "text": "Your message",
    "attachments": attachments
});```

U0THPLS7L : awesome :simple_smile: thanks! Another general question: Lets say I want to do a secret poll which will be revealed later to all members, how would I do that?
U0THPLS7L : can I reveal Emoji reactions with a delay?
U04SM6T2H : :bulb: I just enabled Slack calls for this team
U0LLUCLP3 : Untapped Market: Bots for Twitter Group Chats. Thoughts on how to partake and monetize are encouraged.. :simple_smile:
U0SMQ77D1 : <@U0LLUCLP3> what would they be for?
U0LLUCLP3 : I believe the exact same purposes as the bots in Slack!
U0LLUCLP3 : I intend no disrespect to Slack as I sincerely appreciate the product and associated services!But I only see Twitter group chats growing to the quality of service Slack provides..
I believe this is an excellent opportunity for integration and partnership..
However these kinds of decisions have many factors..
I am only suggesting this as an opportunity for success for the members of this Slack..
Is it viable to use the code used for Slackbots to create Twitter Group Chat Bots?
If so people with existing Slack technologies could possibly sell them to Twitter..

U0LLUCLP3 : Oh nbd just suggesting a merger where either Twitter acquires Slack or vise versa :wink:My sincere apologies for the spam and my lack of tech knowledge!

U0HBN0L9M : wooo big emojis
