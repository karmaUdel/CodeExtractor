I'm using python. I have a column of time series in formate of ( ```pattern = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' ``` The datatype is Series and I need to convert it to string. I searched and I found out I need to use ```Data .astype(str) ``` to convert it to String. I used it but still that column is Series and not string. .astype() didn't convert. What's the solution. How may I do it?
for example. You can find innumerable examples if you search "stringify python" on google
Knit pick, you should probably consider `from __future__ import print_function` to be writing code that's compatible with the future of the language if you're writing python2
