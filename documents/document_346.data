U2D7NUGS1 : So if it's a String - map it to Msg, otherwise - log.
U1CE9DL9H : then, create a decoder for both cases, and use `Decode.oneOf` to combine them
U2D7NUGS1 : What's the other case? Can you give short example?
U1CE9DL9H : I'm not sure from your description. The case you want to catch is "detail.value is of type bool"?
U2D7NUGS1 : No, `bool` is just an example. I want to _catch_ any failure in decoding. E.g. if the whole `event` is `null`, or it doesn't have `detail` property, etc.
U2D7NUGS1 : It needs to be general purpose.
U2D7NUGS1 : Anything except the expected structure.
U1CE9DL9H : right, so ```
oneOf 
    [ Json.Decode.string
        |&gt; <http://Json.Decode.at|Json.Decode.at> [ "detail", "value" ]
        |&gt; Json.Decode.map StringHappened
    , Json.Decode.succeed ( handle error case ) 
    ]
```

U2D7NUGS1 : Oh, that makes sense! Let me try it.
U2D7NUGS1 : Sorry, can't get it to work. Probably my limited understanding plays a huge role here.
U2D7NUGS1 : This is what I'm trying, but it's not compiling: ```, on "opened-changed"
    (Json.Decode.oneOf
        [ Json.Decode.string
            |&gt; <http://Json.Decode.at|Json.Decode.at> [ "detail", "value" ]
            |&gt; Json.Decode.map StringHappened
        , Json.Decode.succeed ( Debug.log "Wrong event", "" )
        ]
    )
```

U2D7NUGS1 : I understand why it's wrong, but don't know how to fix it.
U2D7NUGS1 : Basically I would like the error case to log and do not trigger a message.
U1CE9DL9H : that's not possible
U1CE9DL9H : because both cases need to produce the same type
U1CE9DL9H : but, you can use `Decode.fail`
U2D7NUGS1 : Ok?
U5FC7BE0G : What't the recommended way to write a cookie or write to localstorage with Elm? I need to somehow persist the access token after the user logged in. Do I have to create a port for this or is there a better/simpler way?
U1CE9DL9H : `, Json.Decode.fail (Debug.log "Wrong event" "")` should work I think
U1CE9DL9H : <@U5FC7BE0G> ports are the way to go
U5FC7BE0G : k, thanks!
U2D7NUGS1 : <@U1CE9DL9H> yes it does. Thank you.
U2D7NUGS1 : Any way to access the reason for failure?
U2D7NUGS1 : It would be nice to print it as well.
U0CLDU8UB : The reason for failure is the string you give to Decode.fail
U0CLDU8UB : When you as a developer are telling the Decoder that this case should fail, you should know why. :)
U3KSN5MAL : Silly question but how do you define an incoming port with no arguments?
U3KSN5MAL : `port flyoutResetLights : (Bool -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg`
U3KSN5MAL : one would assume you would just do this `port flyoutResetLights :  Sub msg`

U3KSN5MAL : but of course that doesn't work
U3KSN5MAL : I found this for commands not subs, but doesn't seem to work for subs? `port name : () -&gt; Cmd msg`

U62PAUTV3 : Hi, I am kind of new. Can anyone help me with this question I have?I am trying out a custom defined infix operator but it does not seem to be working :slightly_smiling_face:

U4872964V : <@U3KSN5MAL>, you'd do `(() -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg` i suppose
U5WS7CJLV : syntax help please.  I have a function.
U5WS7CJLV : asJsonValue model =
U5WS7CJLV : Json.Encode.object
U5WS7CJLV : [ ("theJunk" (Json.Encode.string "junk")) ]
U5WS7CJLV : compiler tells me there is no Json.Encode.string
U4872964V : <@U62PAUTV3> you can only use certain symbol characters as operators
U3KSN5MAL : <@U4872964V>  bizarre but seems to work!
U3KSN5MAL : thanks
U62PAUTV3 : I see, thank you. Didn't seem to find a lot of documentation on that one.
U3KSN5MAL : wait no
U3KSN5MAL : ``` Function `flyoutResetLights` is expecting the argument to be:
    () -&gt; Msg

But it is:

    Msg```

U3KSN5MAL : :neutral_face:
U4872964V : <@U5WS7CJLV> do you have `import Json.Encode` in your file?
U5WS7CJLV : yessir
U5WS7CJLV : I can encode a string no problem
U5WS7CJLV : if I try to wrap in an object things fall apart
U4872964V : <@U3KSN5MAL> yes, you need to pass a function, you can do `(\_ -&gt; YourMessage)` or `always YourMessage`
U3KSN5MAL : so i have to pass an argument no matter what?
U4872964V : <@U5WS7CJLV> what is the exact error?
U3KSN5MAL : how annoying
