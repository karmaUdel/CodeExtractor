true, whats the correct elm way to solve this then?
surely this is common place?
updated my code :point_up: , typically in elm, i try not to reach too far into a model to update things but you can by destructuring and then returning a new version with the updated fields
interesting, thanks
how would you model this data then to keep it simple?
I don't think it's that complicated is it?
well from a logic pov it’s confusing
as if you are toggle pause lets say
how he has it is almost right
you wouldn’t be Available you’d always be on a call
so feels strange to have the case statement
it's not a statement
(this is important)
so maybe I am modelling this wrong
it's an expression.
I'm not trying to correct you, I'm trying to explain it's important to think about it differently
do you have any other controls? or just paused as in the operator has put you on hold is that what it means?
There are many
paused is paused recording really
there will be hold
possible more
<@U6EAT2Z37> I understand :slightly_smiling_face:
Okay, well it's a case because you need to take every possible value into account.
yeh I get that
but its not correct for my domain
so I must be modelling it wrong
I don't see why not
because you can’t TogglePaused if someone is not on a call
so i'd make CallState a union type `type CallState = Call | Paused | Hold` etc
doesn’t make sense
oh I see... CallState contains a Bool. Yeah that's not probably what you want.
then i'd change your TogglePaused to be `TogglePaused Bool Call` so you have the call to change so you don't need to worry about if you're not on a call, because you can only toggle a state if you are in a call
