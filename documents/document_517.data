U4872964V : Well, Elm does not really work that way. I know <@U0L8LGP9U> is working on a library to do this, and I put together this ugly beast over my html5 dragdrop library, but we are still figuring these things out unfortunately
U4872964V : Check out <https://ellie-app.com/KvQXcHVwGfa1/2> for my attempt
U39DE7RQ9 : Webpack help anyone? I have copy and pasted the code in webpack.config.js from the Elm tutorial (<https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/04-starting/03-webpack-1.html>) and now I need it to output some additional .html files. How do I do that? The files are placed in the src folder of my app
U236M9FH9 : <@U39DE7RQ9> Pretty sure you just run `webpack` instead of webpack-dev-server &amp; it should be available in your `output.path`
U39DE7RQ9 : When i develop my app I run yarn start. So how do I just run webpack <@U236M9FH9> ?
U236M9FH9 : node_modules/.bin/webpack
U39DE7RQ9 : OK will try
U236M9FH9 : Usually I add add something like this to package.json:```
"scripts": { "build": "webpack" } 
```
then just run `npm run build` or `yarn run build`

U39DE7RQ9 : Mine looks like this:```
"scripts": {
    "build": "webpack",
    "client": "webpack-dev-server --port 3000",
    "start": "nf start"
  }
```

U39DE7RQ9 : When I run webpack it outputs the same as when I run the dev-server. I need it to include som extra files from the src folder. How do I do that?
U39DE7RQ9 : Shouldn't this copy all of my .html files to the output folder?```
{
        test:    /\.html$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loader:  'file-loader?name=[name].[ext]',
      }
```

U236M9FH9 : I think only those that're imported by your `index.js`.
U236M9FH9 : You could use the copy webpack plugin: <https://github.com/kevlened/copy-webpack-plugin>
U39DE7RQ9 : OK, thanks!
U6AU4N1HR : Hey, I'm doing Json.Decode.map5 over a JSON and creating record User. I want to add another field to that record, which is a list. The problem is, this list is not a part of JSON. I want to intiliaze record User with a empty list. Is it possible to somehow use empty list with Json.Decode.map6?
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U6AU4N1HR> The record constructor is just a regular function. You could instead go `\a b c d e -&gt; MyRecord a b c [] d e` You could also use `Json.Decode.succeed []` with the `map6`
U14Q8S4EM : You can do `succeed list`
U14Q8S4EM : `Json.Decode.succeed whateverListYouWanted`
U14Q8S4EM : Yeah what <@U48AEBJQ3> said
U6AU4N1HR : Thanks!
U6AU4N1HR : Didn't see the succeed function
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U6AU4N1HR> 
```
decodeUser : Decode.Decoder User
decodeUser =
    Decode.map5
        (\id userName firstName gender booksCount -&gt;
            User id userName firstName gender booksCount [])
        (Decode.field "id" <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
        (Decode.field "username" Decode.string)
        (Decode.field "first_name" Decode.string)
        (<http://Decode.at|Decode.at> [ "profile", "gender" ] Decode.string)
        (Decode.field "books_count" <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
```

or, if you moved that field to the top of the record:

```
decodeUser : Decode.Decoder User
decodeUser =
    Decode.map5 (User [])
        (Decode.field "id" <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
        (Decode.field "username" Decode.string)
        (Decode.field "first_name" Decode.string)
        (<http://Decode.at|Decode.at> [ "profile", "gender" ] Decode.string)
        (Decode.field "books_count" <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
```

U6AU4N1HR : <@U48AEBJQ3> ok i get it, thanks
U4RR7KX45 : ```type alias Year =
    Float


type alias Seconds =
    number


type alias Details =
    ( Year, Seconds )
```
what's wrong with this code?

U4RR7KX45 : gives me the following error```
Type alias `Seconds` must declare its use of type variable number

21|&gt;type alias Seconds =
22|&gt;    number

You probably need to change the declaration like this:

type alias Seconds number = ...

```

U6CBXFWHG : trying to setup my atom ide for elm, and I get a linter error
module Main exposing (..)

is all I have in the file, and the linter says "The system cannot find the path specified."

any ideas?

U6CBXFWHG : Im trying to follow the elm tutorial on <http://knowthen.com|knowthen.com>
U635238TG : is your file named Main.elm?
U635238TG : I had something like that happen to me when I didn't have a Main.elm for it to pull in. I'm a total newb though
U153UK3FA : <@U4RR7KX45> that's not going to work, you need to specify what type of `number` will be in that type
U6CBXFWHG : test.elm
