so have a root node is a good idea? :slightly_smiling_face:
All trees must have a root node :slightly_smiling_face:
ok, ty. let me some time to figure out how it works :smile:
Hi, I would love some feedback on a little game I made. <https://ellie-app.com/3zW9S8VjvSVa1/0>
Hmm <@U5LFUHH19> - doesn't seem to compile... ?
Hmm, sorry.  Try again? <https://ellie-app.com/3zW9S8VjvSVa1/2>
Aha! :slightly_smiling_face:
BTW, I came across this game at a science center yesterday.  I've yet to solve it (move all the frogs to the other side)
But I thought it might help me to learn Elm, think about state, explore new modules, etc.
Ah!  Interesting :smile:  Hmm, when I click on Frog 2 at the beginning of the game, it doesn't do what I'd expect
(move the open space to space 2)
Frogs can only jump over one other frog to get to empty space or move to immediately adjacent space.
Sorry, I mean the Frog in Space 2
Sorry, I should have more boilerplate about the rules and goals.
(that one should be able to jump right?)
Yes, Frog 2 should be able to leap over 3 to get to the space in slot 4 (all assuming 0-based indexing)
kyclark: Okay, yeah (Right, I'm just using the numbers as labeled on the spaces).  Looks like it is instead moving the Frog in space 3 for some reason.
Solution: <http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/frog_puzzle_sol.htm>
I think I should make a version with 2-4 frogs to warmup!
Oh, and I should add a counter to keep track of how many moves.
I think line 120 is where the bug is
Should be `[ Space, y, x ]` right?
<@U0LPMPL2U> why `List.map (insertItem item) tree.children -- make this return a Tree, not a list` is here?
I thought things like `appendChild` should return a `Tree` instance then, no?
and in such case branch 1 returning `Tree` and branch 2 `List Tree`
(and Also line 132?)
OK, I'm going to really think about those lines.  I'm not at all sure I have the logic correct.
:smile: (Mostly I just noticed that when I click the frog, the wrong frog moves! Hehe)
Yes, you are correct!  Thanks bigly
:laughing: Any time!
Oh, interesting - almost had it solved, but I just noticed that when I get the last right-frog to Space 1, (with space 0 open) I can't move it over for some reason.  Must be some small logic error there too...
(possibly `slots` isn't what you're expecting it to be, since it's usually the frog and the two spaces in front of it, but that frog only has 1 space in front of it?)
Yes, I was just seeing this, too.  It helped me to 1) find the solution and 2) step through with only 3 frogs.  I need to iron out that bug.
<@U1G51S63S> yeah, my comment there was to say return a `Tree`, not a `List Tree` in branch 2
