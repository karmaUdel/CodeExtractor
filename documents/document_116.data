```
Still throwing ` :cause "Can't let qualified name: wef-backend.test-util/conn# "` though
is d/db a macro?
no
but I get the same error even if I deleted the whole ~ctx-binding line
I never got that error with uri# or datomic# by the way, it only occured when I added conn#
It's probably something silly
do you have a var named conn# in that namespace?
<@U5ZAJ15P0> What does macroexpand give you?
<@U0NCTKEV8> no, I checked. Let me check again just to make sure..
`java.lang.RuntimeException: No such var: wef-backend.test-util/conn#`
you could fix it immediately by replacing most of the macro with a function that returns the context, and have the macro expand in to invoking that and then deleting it
but that wouldn't tell you what is wrong
