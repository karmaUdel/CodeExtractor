That was unnecessarily hard :stuck_out_tongue:
That's also invalid python you posted - so already it suggests that you aren't really showing what you have tried :confused:
makes it easier to format code for readability compared to regular text
so, `datetime.date` requires three inputs
`year`, `month`, `day`
all have to be integers
eg, `datetime.date(2017, 05, 17)`
the thing is that i get this format from jquery date time picker
<@U5X85H02X> <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime>
is there any way i can manage the format i posted because all my data is saved like that and  i have to do the queries in that format to get the correct detail
from the database
my queries have to with date and time values because in the database are saved in this format
You mean they are not saved as datetimes?
Anyone here used dreamfactory? Trying to insert a list of rows using a stored procedure. Hoping not to have to do thousands of calls to the sp.
date and time
2017-06-14 00:00:00
2017-06-14 23:59:59
As what column type?
How are you querying?
Please give more relevant info, you can see <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask> for tips on how to ask good questions
i think you are been an ass
if you dont know
dont say anything
<@U1BP42MRS>
You realize I am asking more questions to better understand your question to actually solve it right?
Calling people names is not something we tolerate here.

yea, stop being a poo poo head.

Was about to drop some spanglish to let her know what was up... but yeah, account deactivated
<@U0NRYQNAZ> poo poo head... them's is fightin' words ...
<@U5X85H02X> there are ways to format datetimes. depending on what you are using to query the database some of this can be done for you. we don't really know if questions aren't posted with example code that replicates what you are trying to do or code that shows what you have tried.
hence, the reason you are being directed to a SO guide.
I think that person is go bye bye.
why isn't “poo poo head” in the list of profanity for <@USLACKBOT> ?
Do you find the language to be obscene?
Or silly?
Hate to repeat myself, but I think it may have been missed in that fun.

no, never heard of dreamfactory.
lol <@U2BS4M1RV>
sounds pleasant.
you can fire off stored procedures with sqlalchemy.
sounds like a dream ~
that's about all i know.
I  thought about it <@U1NSCAY6R>, but didn't want to go there.... lol
dreamfactory is a php application that provides a rest api for many databases. It's really nice in ways, can be frustrating.
sounds like the opposite of a dream.
php
comatose
Well, learning how to do deal with it is fun, and the documentation is lacking and somewhat outdated.
mummification
That's a dangerous proposition. I don't care about the language, the issue is leaking a database and relations to an API. It's good to try to have some separation of the view layer and the persistence layer
It is nice not having to deal with mysql library deficiencies and install issues. Also makes it easier to protect a database.
We're using stored procedure calls through the rest api, so very little is exposed to the user, and it's per key for access.
i'm mostly just joking around. sorry i can't be more help.
Just hoping I don't have to call my stored procedure once per row to insert... it's going to be hundreds of thousands of rows.
Are you locked into DreamFactory?
That is good to hear, though sprocs scare me for other reasons :joy: . Bad flashbacks
No. We've been using it for a few months though.
Had never heard of it before, looking through their site, looks solid. Last couple of API's I did were w/ Slim (PHP framework). Sorry, can't help.
If we keep breaking the mysql cluster maybe we'll switch to postgres and something else. :slightly_smiling_face:
crunchy mysql
Does anyone have experience making large requests to facebook endpoints?
What's that?
<@U2BS4M1RV> just me being facetious
oh, okay.
<@U486CN4VD> not here, sorry
<@U486CN4VD> yes - what kinds of requests
endpoints related to advertising campaigns! /campaigns, /adsets, /ads
Ah I dealt more so with querying and pulling info on pages
but what kind of stuff are you wondering about?
efficient ways to grab several thousand records/json arrays
u can use python with just requests and json thats what I always use
actually just with requests even
`requests.get('url').json()`  you just want to look at their documentation and dig a little to find out how you can make the most requests possible - because some of their apis do allow batching, or multiple queries at one time
hey what is the best way to write a list of json objects to a file
I was thinking of writing it into a csv
where each row is a basically a json object or should I save it as a json file?
<@U5PJK7JHE> You should probably either do a CSV, which would mean breaking the JSON into columns in your CSV or just a file where each line is a new JSON object
You could make the JSON a column of the CSV, technically, but that would be kind of awkward to use again
yeah that is very awkward and hard to use I am thinking of latter
Are you going to want to search them for anything? If so - you may be best served to dump the contents into a database so you can query and such
yeah right now I just want to work with files and if needed we can move to db
how big is the file
its quite small 1200x250x4 float array is basically what it is
dump it as json then either transfor in refine in a matter of seconds or drop it on here if its small enough: <https://konklone.io/json/>
oh it is better if I automate it I just dumped as a json object
thanks  guys!
will dict and dict2 be the same always?
since dictionaries are unordered, I would suspect the output of zip to produce the same results as the original dict, barring mutation of keys or values
this is my best guess
contents and keys i'm confident in
ordering, not sure but think they probably will be the same
I assume that shallow copy or deep copy is not related to your problem
if uncertain, instead of `dict == dict2` you could ask `all(dict.keys() in dict2)`
Since dictionaries don't keep order like <@U29TTK2NS> said, the calls to `keys` and `values` are not guaranteed to be in the same order (though the resulting lists _do_ maintain their order but are not created in order). Because of that, zipping them back together will not be equal (because keys may have new values and order may not be the same). However if you used an `OrderedDict` then keys and values lists will maintain order, so calling `zip` in that instance would result in the same results 
hi, i'm getting TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable when using data = request.json(). any ideas why? thanks in advance!
hi <@U5XHLGL4B>, what is `request`?
hrm, I've never used bottle but it looks like `request` is implicit.  Is it safe for me to assume you want to convert the request to json?
<@U486CN4VD> yeah
<@U486CN4VD> :taco: 
Okay, per <https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/api.html#bottle.BaseRequest.json>, it looks like you can only use that method if the content type header is application/json or application/json-rpc. I'm guessing it's not. You can probably see this if you directly print the `request` object. If you still want to force this to json, you can `import json` then use `json.dumps(request)`.
thanks, <@U1BP42MRS> :smile:
Thank you for taking time to understand the problem, ask clarifying questions and answer!
thanks!!
Any tips on forming an LLC would be welcomed. I'm based in the USA (Colorado, specifically)
I'm looking to funnel contract work through the LLC and a few other ventures.
