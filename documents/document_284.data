Basically, needs two arguments, label and value
Confused as to why that doesn't throw a compiler error...
Elm has partial application and first-class functions. `Debug.log "Foo"` produces a function of type (a -&gt; a) which you assign to `_` so it gets promptly ignored.
Ah, that definitely makes sense. Thanks for the insight <@U48AEBJQ3> :slightly_smiling_face:
It could be something that produces a warning, though. You might add an issue on <https://github.com/elm-lang/error-message-catalog>
Sweet :slightly_smiling_face: Will do. Given that I spent about an hour smashing my head against that, seems like it could be valuable warnings for beginners
<@U5XHTBFS6> I'm writing an app with leaflet as the main character. I tried using ports, but after watching richard feldman's talk, I opted for writing a custom element. Not sure if that's convinient for all cases, though.

I pass the layers I want as a property
I plan to extract an example from my code some time in the following weeks.
And publish it
What is the purpose of `radians` function. It returns the given value.
Using the `turns`/`radians`/`degrees` functions consistently means that "standard Elm angles" could theoretically be changed without further impact. In practice, there isn't that much values except being explicit about things. `radians 12` says more than `12`
Is there any packages for Julian Day Numbers?
<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justinmimbs/elm-date-extra/1.0.1> this package had it, but now API for Julian days is removed.
I think elm-date-extra has that
