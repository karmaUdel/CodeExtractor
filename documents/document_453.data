That might be extended to `Status = ... | OnCall Bool Call` though
which guarantees that you only have that bool if you're actually in a call
come to think of it `OnCall Bool Call` is basically `OnCall Call | Paused Call` anyway
true, but this is just a simple example
i also have transfer, hold etc
