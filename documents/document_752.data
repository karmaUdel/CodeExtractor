U2P9RBH4J : <@U0LEKMCRW> reminded me of an issue I had with Elm running on NixOS. NixOS runs everything with Symlinks via the /nix/store/{hash}-package-name.nix… 
So it doesn’t have a /lib or /lib32.
Anyone here use elm + webpack with NixOS and have experience fixing the issues with running npm/yarn/elm binaries on Nix?
Or just have experience running elm on NixOS in general? I’d love to see an example project.

U5LFUHH19 : Is there a nice module somewhere to put commas in numbers e.g., "12345" -&gt; "12,345"?
U5LFUHH19 : Sorry, Number.Format.  D'oh!
U23SA861Y : now is it internationalized....
U5LFUHH19 : Wait, Number.Format won't install for Elm 0.18.  What is the proper module?
U23SA861Y : believe it or not, this is actually an extremely difficult problem
U5LFUHH19 : Maybe "FormatNumber" (<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/cuducos/elm-format-number/latest>)?
U23SA861Y : is this for currency or...?
U5LFUHH19 : No, just an Int.
U5LFUHH19 : E.g., number of results for a search.
U5ABF3BH7 : Hi everyone, I have a record I want to encode though Json.EncodeFrom my record ```model = { type_ = “at-need’}```, I want to create a Json object ``{“case_types” =&gt; [“at_need”, “”] } ``

if I wanted to pass the param as is, I do 
  ```   Json.Object
     [(“case_types”, Json.string model.type_)] ```
Which gives me ``{“case_types” =&gt; “at_need”}``
But I want to pass ``{“case_types” =&gt; [“at_need”, “”] }``  (an array)
How can I do that?

U0LPMPL2U : You want to use `Json.Encode.list` to encode a list
U23SA861Y : <https://ellie-app.com/3N7myrGxCFCa1/0>
U23SA861Y : <@U5LFUHH19> I don't think there is a native elm library to do what you want
U0U6ML22H : off the top of my head: <https://ellie-app.com/3N7mVqMCHYHa1/0>
U0U6ML22H : ah, too slow :wink:
U23SA861Y : snooze you lose
U0U6ML22H : I know, but snoozing is my favorite activity, so there.
U0U6ML22H : :wink:
U5ABF3BH7 : Never mind my question, I finally figured it out, I needed ```("case_types", Json.list [Json.string "at-need", Json.string ""])```
U5LFUHH19 : How can I do Int -&gt; Float?
U0X1G7NVD : Maybe too late, but you could use `elm-format-number` to format the number per se (customize separators for cents and thousands, amount of decimals etc) and then just concat the currency string in a separate function
U2XRG0UKA : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Basics#toFloat>
U2XRG0UKA : `toFloat`
U5LFUHH19 : Ah, jeez, just saw that.  Thanks.
U0U6ML22H : <http://klaftertief.github.io/elm-search/?q=Int+-%3E+Float>
U0U6ML22H : Fancy Search is oh so fancy
U5LFUHH19 : That is soooo nice.
U23SA861Y : I am hesitant to recommend packages outside the stdlib which I have not had direct experience with.
