<@U3QUAHZJ6> (some-fn :a :b) not good enough?
some-fn is actually a function? i presumed i was supposed to fill in the gaps &gt;.&lt; feel so dumb right now
oh I'm sorry yeah I could see how you'd read it that way. but no, some-fn is a higher order function that takes a list of predicate functions and returns a single predicate function that is the logical or of all of them
makes sense now!
you could also do `#(some % [:a :b])`
^ relies on maps acting as functions
You can use :req-un [(or ::foo ::bar)]
I totally forgot about that syntax
It's one thing I love in spec
Where `(my-pred x)` returns either `nil` or a value I want to use?
