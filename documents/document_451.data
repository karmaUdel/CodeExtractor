U48AEBJQ3 : <@U17P7CBFB> There seems to be something else going on here.
U17P7CBFB : ok, I'll try to fix the other errors first
U68RXKS5D : Is there a way to define a subscription port that doesn't have input. I'm thinking of it more as a "command" from the JS side. Does that make sense?
U68RXKS5D : e.g. `app.ports.doAThing.send()`
U0J1M0F32 : Yah, that makes sense, but I'm not sure I've ever done it. :thinking_face:
U68RXKS5D : i ended up sending along an empty string, but that feels pretty icky
U68RXKS5D : tried things like `port doAThing : (Nothing -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg` but that's not even valid
U23SA861Y : typically no data would be a unit type
U23SA861Y : ```port doAThingWrap : ( () -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg
doAThing : msg -&gt; Sub msg 
doAThing msg = doAThingWrap (\_ -&gt; msg)
```

U68RXKS5D : ah hah, i'll try!
U68RXKS5D : that made the compiler happy! still had to do something icky to make the subscriptions compile. thoughts on this?
```
subscriptions model = doAThing (\() -&gt; AnMessage)
```

U23SA861Y : see wrapper above
U68RXKS5D : ah hah, funky (and sorry i missed that reply). not sure how i feel about that. are my alarm bells valid?
U23SA861Y : it's not that ugly
U68RXKS5D : w/ that wrapper, i'd still access it on the JS side by the wrapped name, correct? `app.ports.doAThingWrap.send()`
U23SA861Y : yeah
U23SA861Y : might have to work on the names
U68RXKS5D : cool. thanks for helping clear that up for me! helps unblock my brain :smile:
U68RXKS5D : <@U23SA861Y>++ :heart:
U68RXKS5D : this unit type is a new idea on me. either i missed it in reading or it's not covered well. here's a thing i found to read if others are interested <https://gist.github.com/sporto/401afc781341a55fbfa7>
U23SA861Y : it's the base case of the tuple
U23SA861Y : It basically just says there exists a tuple with no values, there is an equivalent one for records `{}`
U23SA861Y : although unit `()` is more common
U68RXKS5D : makes sense :+1:
U68RXKS5D : haha this is a bummer :laughing: ```
&gt; app.ports.onSubmit.send()
Error: Trying to send an unexpected type of value through port `onSubmit`:
Expecting null but instead got: undefined
&gt; app.ports.onSubmit.send(null)
undefined
&gt; lolwat: []
```

Apparently `null` is nothing, not `undefined` :facepalm:

U4JT89FGB : thanks <@U0FP80EKB> re: animations
U2GPAEU1L : <@U68RXKS5D> 
`null != undefined`…actually that's a lie, freaking javascript, rather `null !== undefined`.

Null and undefined are different, what's the bummer?

U68RXKS5D : just a bummer that you have to explicitly pass along `null` to send that message
U68RXKS5D : not calling it wrong by any means
U2GPAEU1L : Well is the Elm on the other side expecting `null`?
U68RXKS5D : unclear, see above. the port is defined w/ a unit type
U2GPAEU1L : How are you decoding?
U68RXKS5D : so i guess it's technically expecting `()`?
U68RXKS5D : not sure what you mean exactly
