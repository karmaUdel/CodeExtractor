U4FSUJLLU : i don't know how to do that
U4FSUJLLU : <@U4PHRM50D> any hints ?
U4PHRM50D : google it :simple_smile: we are using postgres as a DB but you could use whatever DB you want
U4PHRM50D : assuming you're using node botkit, google 'node &lt;insert the DB you want to use&gt; tutorial'
U4PHRM50D : i haven't the default json file storage that comes with the botkit but you could probably use that too. i couldn't help since i haven't used it
U4SFSAMAS : Hi guys, I'm following <https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html> to build my first bot. It uses the official python slack client. Basically I'm getting the following error:

U4SFSAMAS : Any pointers on how to solve this?
U2QGELSTS : <@U4SFSAMAS>: it might make more sense to ask in <#C1HJWSCL8|sdk-python-slackclien>
U2QGELSTS : but off the top of my head, it seems like your system isn't set up quite right, because <http://slack.com|slack.com> has a valid SSL cert AFAIK.
U4SFSAMAS : will post there thanks buddy
U3C1KGJDD : guys, seems I can't reset the menu in messenger. Been trying ```controller.api.thread_settings.delete_menu();``` am i doing it right?
U4QKKHSFK : <@U4SFSAMAS> I used the exact tutorials for building my bot.
U4QKKHSFK : Which platform is this running on ?
U4QKKHSFK : I had similar ssl issues on an osx machine. Hence i switched to ubuntu and everything worked ust fine.
U37C5V3HT : How can i tell my slackbot to ask questions on different time let's say once in a week or after 8 hours... :thinking_face: 
U37C5V3HT : Automatically
U4R8U1QKX : u could use a cron-like scheduler
U4R8U1QKX : <https://github.com/node-schedule/node-schedule>
U04SM6T2H : you can get timezone info from Slack user profiles
U37C5V3HT : Thanks <@U04SM6T2H> and <@U4R8U1QKX>
U4KTWEHQC : Hey bot lovers! Could you recommend me your favourite blogs/writers about bots, pls? :slightly_smiling_face:

U04SM6T2H : our blog is filled with good stuff <http://blog.howdy.ai|blog.howdy.ai>
U4KTWEHQC : <@U04SM6T2H> thanks Ben!
U3ES7AM6X : <@U04S3JCH2> <@U04SM6T2H> can I just confide in some comrades? If you are using machine learning for intent detection for your bot, training it can get tedious as :poop:
U3ES7AM6X : also stemming and trimming! I use spaCy so it does some of it but, unnng.
U4T6FF4CA : Hi, I am trying to use "typing indicator" with the python SlackClient. Anyone know how to do that?
U4T6FF4CA : I see you are supposed to send something like ```            {                "id": 1,
                "type": "typing",
                "channel": channel
            }
```, but I am not sure what method to pass that too, or what the "raw send" method is in sc

U37C5V3HT : Anyone has a detailed process how to deploy a botkit slack app i can host on beepboop? Thanks
U4TPM36MU : why not just use heroku <@U37C5V3HT>
U4T9L1AF4 : Hi everyone !
U4TPM36MU : <@U4T9L1AF4> what up
U0Y7H2F3M : abinash_mohanty: you can use Heroku or AWS free tier for the deployment. Let me know if you need any help in this. :+1:
