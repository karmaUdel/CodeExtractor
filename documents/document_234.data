```
is that an elm signature?
no, that's just `elm` as short for `element`
ha, ooops
yeah, their website is mostly react
hey elmos
from the Html package
where does `Node` comes from?
from the `VirtualDom` package
similarly, `type alias Svg msg = Node msg`. That is to say; they both use virtual-dom nodes under the hood :slightly_smiling_face:
Oh I see
but the documentation don't link Node with VirtualDom.Node
yeah, it's a little annoying that it doesn't do cross-package links
I think there's a bug for it
thanks so much
now, `type Node msg = Node`
what is `msg` ?
That's because it uses Native. So basically, it's a combination of phantom types and native magic; through which you can save information in structures in an "non-type-safe" manner
`msg` in this case is a type variable for the message type that can be "emitted" from your dom-nodes through events
so you can do `onClick MyMsg` which is an `Attribute Msg` (because `MyMsg` is of type `Msg`). A dom node can have multiple attributes, and all of its children can have attributes, but they have to match types, so your final structure can only emit *one* type of events
<@U3SJEDR96> thanks !!
hi can someone advise on List mapping?
this is my code:
        List.map updateVideo model.captions
and the error is
    an upper case name
Hi, there is something that I quite yet don't understand with elm: how `&lt;textarea&gt;` or `&lt;input&gt;` are handled. In the examples, the `&lt;input&gt;` are left blank in the view, without using the model: `input [ onInput Change ] []` while I'd think something like `input [ value model.something, onInput Change ] []` would be more appropriate.
Why does the compiler want an uppercase name?
<@U5QPUBDQR> I think you're missing a `let ... in` around that first part
<@U3SJEDR96> that code is already nested in a let … in
can i nest again?
<@U59AF21LJ> the DOM (in your browser) keeps it own state. _Usually_ we'll make sure that the dom reflects our model by using `value model.something` in the view, but this in't always required (and actually, not always what you want)
        ({ model | captions = newCaptions, debug = b }, Cmd.none)
hm, but where do you expect the result of that `List.map` to go?
<@U3SJEDR96> i have a list and i want to update one element of that list
i need a specific element with a certain ident
