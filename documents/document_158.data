```
so you changed no code inside of the conversation bot?
also <@U0HBN0L9M> or anyone, do you know if botkit simplifies exchanging and storing a returned auth_code for an updated access token to attach to a user?
do i need to keep track of access tokens for all users if I want to delete messages on behalf of them? or can i just get an admin to give the bot permission to delete everyone else's messages with one super token?
all i done was hardcode my bots token
instead of reading it from env
