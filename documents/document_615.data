but it's about 2000 lines already and I should add 300 more icons now :smile:
(className is a string because `Svg.Attributes.class` was not special case like in `Html` and not allowed to use twice for example. looks like fixed already, need to rewrite)
but this code requires a lot of work - need to `svgo` icons, extract paths (and avoid root `svg` tag), paste it here. I think it will be easier when webpack will do it
and it will be a hell when icons will change
I am really just considering other ways now - `object`, svg sprites, etc.
looks like `object` allows some customizations too
is there special magic involved in the `Json.Decode` functions or can they be implemented in pure elm?
You can implement json decoders in pure elm
under the hood, `Json.Decode` may have some fancy stuff but you never need to deal with that
i'm specifically looking for that fancy stuff though
i am trying to construct a record piece by piece from results
from a form record
You can do that in pure elm using the functions provided by `Json.Decode`
there's no json involved there, i am merely trying to copy the api
Ah, so you have many `Result` values that you want to combine together?
in a way -- and collect in a record
can i paste stuff in here?
sure that would be helpful :slightly_smiling_face:
