Is this something I should publish as a package?
<@U5FU80S06> <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justgage/tachyons-elm/1.0.0/Tachyons#classes>
I suppose <@U0H8PND27> may decide to pull that one function up into a separate heading :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U0NGNUH4J>: you could, though this type of thing tends to be very nice for very specific use-cases. `NonEmpty` isn't used a lot, so I imagine `Compound` would be used even less. Nevertheless, implementing some more "basic" features on it (like `fromList : List a -&gt; Maybe (Compound a)`, `.map`, ..) would certainly be interesting!
ok! I’ll give it a go and see where I end up :slightly_smiling_face:
Hi :slightly_smiling_face: I've trouble searching for syntactic sugar. Hope you can healp me out.
So I have a function with 2 arguments calling another function with the same arguments and using the result. I would like to compose `funInternal` with `(++) pre`
yeah, there's no operator for that. You can get rid of `b`, but not both. You _could_ hack around it and do `fun = curry &gt;&gt; (uncurry funInternal) &gt;&gt; (++) "pre"` I think
oh wait, what am I saying?
