U1BP42MRS : Is it line 5 and you are trying to check if the input value is in the books dictionary?
U1BP42MRS : First, be sure to not override built-ins (`while str not in`, `str` is a built in). I also believe that you want `i` instead of `str` there
U1BP42MRS : But you can just check `if key in dict: print('Yay, it exists!')`
U6EN2E1LG : but i isn't going to print out
U6EN2E1LG : I ran the for loop but when I go to select I, I get ‘dict_items' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
U1BP42MRS : Oh, yeah you can't use integers in a dict - you are asking the user to give you an int and then looking that up in the dict
U1BP42MRS : If you want to do that, you need to keep track of what keys the integers correlate with
U6EN2E1LG : Thats im trying to do by converting it into a tuple
U6EN2E1LG : but i guess that doesnt work
U1BP42MRS : Dictionaries don't keep order until python 3.6, just an FYI - so that could work if you save it to a variable first, then ask for input
U1BP42MRS : So maybe something like: 
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; options = list(enumerate(d.items()))
&gt;&gt;&gt; options
[(0, ('Game of Thrones', 50.0))]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i, (k, v) in options:
...   print("select", i," for ", k)
...
select 0  for  Game of Thrones
&gt;&gt;&gt; options[0]
(0, ('Game of Thrones', 50.0))
```

U1BP42MRS : Actually in that case, probably better to just do `options = list(d.items())` which will give you a list of tuples, then from there the `i` value is the array index
U6EN2E1LG : ‘float' object is not iterable
U6EN2E1LG : that was the error I got
U1BP42MRS : Looking <@U6EN2E1LG>
U1BP42MRS : just a minute
U6EN2E1LG : ok
U1BP42MRS : What line is the error in the stacktrace <@U6EN2E1LG>
U1BP42MRS : `enumerate(options)`
U1BP42MRS : sorry
U6EN2E1LG : ok then what would I put if I wanted to print out he key and value?
U1BP42MRS : How about you tell me on that one :slightly_smiling_face: Try it a bit and then report back if you are stuck
U1BP42MRS : I don't want to give you too many answers to prohibit you learning it :slightly_smiling_face:
U6EN2E1LG : I would continue using options correct?
U1BP42MRS : Yep
U1BP42MRS : You can grab it from options, which is a list of tuples `[(key, value)] -&gt; [("Movie Name", float_val)]`
U1BP42MRS : So `options[i][0]` and `options[i][1]`
U6EN2E1LG : It says “list indices must be integers or slices, not str”
U6EN2E1LG : thats the snippet I ran
U1BP42MRS : The question you need to ask yourself is which thing in that snippet can give you a string that is used in `options`?
U6EN2E1LG : the str function
U1BP42MRS : You aren't using the `str` function
U1BP42MRS : The issue is that you are passing a `str` as an index
U6EN2E1LG : can you use int?
U1BP42MRS : That's what you want to use in a list :slightly_smiling_face:
U1BP42MRS : Check this doc on `input` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input>
U1BP42MRS : &gt; The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string
U6EN2E1LG : ok
U6EN2E1LG : Now how would validate the input?
U6EN2E1LG : at least what would be the thing I am looking for in the while statement?
U1BP42MRS : I'll leave that to you for a little to try out, let me know if you hit your head on it too long
U6EN2E1LG : hint at least? pretty please with sprinkles on top :smile:
U1BP42MRS : You have a list of things, you need to make sure the input is in that list :wink:
U6EN2E1LG : while i not in range(options)?
U1BP42MRS : Test it out
U1BP42MRS : the nice thing about programming is you can test theories pretty easily :smile:
U6EN2E1LG : that is true
U6EN2E1LG : I got this “‘list' object cannot be interpreted as an integer”
U1BP42MRS : And which thing in that is a `list`?
U6B5YDMHT : <@U47RVMQ77> <@U1BP42MRS> (sorry for the days-late response). Yes. My app is in installed apps and the admin panel is fully accessible and usable, but with the generic user model
U6EN2E1LG : the options
U6EN2E1LG : correct?
U6EV1BBJ4 : I Want to learn python can any tell me where to start?
U1BP42MRS : <@U6EV1BBJ4> What's your programming experience level? Are you fully new to programming, or know another language?
U1BP42MRS : Because `i` is set to the last index in the loop because python has function scoping, meaning that any variable defined within the function body (even nested scopes) will be available in the function.
It appears you need to use `num` rather than `i` to get the value from options

U6EN2E1LG : right I got it figured out
U6EN2E1LG : When I run the menuI enter my command do the selected function
Function goes through and what I need it to do 
then when I return it takes me back to the menu
when I enter a command to do another function it stops
why does it do that?

U6EV1BBJ4 : <@U1BP42MRS> I Learned "C" language, And have good experience in it.
U1BP42MRS : I think being here and asking questions in <#C07EW4DNE|learning_python> is a good start, probably just writing some applications and the like will get you up to speed if you know programming already <@U6EV1BBJ4>

U540Q65PF : I finished sts http.sslVeify = False option setting.
U540Q65PF : and When I use shell command git clone repository work!
U540Q65PF : just problem invoked when clone in STS.. TT
U5RJNFFGX : Anyone ever use mechanize? How easy is it to mock inputs + button clicks and is it reliable?
U4BMZ90T0 : Attempting to install python for VS on friends computer, but for some reason the option with the VS installer is not coming up
U4BMZ90T0 : VS 2017 professional edition
U5U4MSHC1 : Can anyone suggest me a good PDF creator package? I need to generate reports in PDFs
U4BMZ90T0 : What is the best way to have a function run in code when referencing an object that will not have been initialized at build time?
U1BP42MRS : <@U4BMZ90T0> - build time? What is this, Java?
U1BP42MRS : JK of course, can you clarify a little?
U4BMZ90T0 : im all over the place lmao
U4BMZ90T0 : So basically similar to what I was asking a few days ago regarding doing some lambda stuff
U1BP42MRS : Ah
U4BMZ90T0 : I have a config file where
U4BMZ90T0 : I update the settings as a user enters their choices
U4BMZ90T0 : And in one part I have 3 separate lists a user can choose from, but the way they choose the list is by the title of the list
U4BMZ90T0 : then in tkinter on the next screen, the appropriate list shows up
U4BMZ90T0 : However, in tkinter since it builds each frame before it runs, it doesn't get filled with the user selection
U4BMZ90T0 : and it doesn't like that I want to wait for user input before filling up a `OptionMenu`
U4BMZ90T0 : so I was thinking that on submit of the screen before, I could simply access the next Frame before it appears, clear the list, and populate it with the correct values
U4BMZ90T0 : But I wasn't sure if there was a less annoying walk around?
U5LNXQHN3 : Sounds like you need to wait to build the GUI until after the input has happened
U4BMZ90T0 : Well if that were the case, in tkinter I would need multiple mainloops because all the Frames in a single mainloop are built before any single Frame shows to a user
U4BMZ90T0 : And multiple mainloops means multiple screens
U4BMZ90T0 : Guess I just chose a crappy GUI framework to begin with, compared to the rest at least...
U4BMZ90T0 : I'll go ahead with the manual option
U5LNXQHN3 : You probably need to change the UI from within an event, called from the main loop
U5LNXQHN3 : But yeah, tkinter is not exactly 21st century stuff
U4BMZ90T0 : Yup, good times with the 1900s, good times
U4BMZ90T0 : Anyone know what the error `Import Error: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found.`
U4BMZ90T0 : after installing lxml via pip
U4BMZ90T0 : basically showing `"/venv/lib/site-packages/lxml/html/__init__.py" from .. import etree`
U1BP42MRS : Maybe try the binary installer for windows?
U1BP42MRS : <http://lxml.de/installation.html#source-builds-on-ms-windows>
U4BMZ90T0 : Okay
U1BP42MRS : I am just spitballing, sorry if it's not helpful :confused:
U4BMZ90T0 : I was about to try that
U1BP42MRS : I just remember returning my windows box within a day after trying to get C-libs to build on windows
U1BP42MRS : apparently the anaconda distribution really helps on windows though, it may be worth looking into
U4BMZ90T0 : Yeah it's horrible honestly
U1BP42MRS : have you tried WSL yet?
U4BMZ90T0 : I have not actually, I have ubuntu on my surface pro, but that's a pain in my ass
U1BP42MRS : :disappointed:
U4BMZ90T0 : Might be better now, but it took so long to get it to work lmao
U4BMZ90T0 : Is github down?
U6F02EZ17 : Did slackbot just gasp at ‘ass'?
U6F02EZ17 : Amazing.
U1BP42MRS : Yes, github is having "major outages"
U4BMZ90T0 : I can't build from the tarball
U42LCHFD2 : yeah github is down at the moment
U6G2EGCH2 : says normal service is returning now
U5CGPBF0U : Has anyone ever used slackbot in the history of slackbot?
U42LCHFD2 : nope, not I
U6F02EZ17 : My work team and I use it for team-wide reminders.
U6G2EGCH2 : slackbot can be useful i guess
U6F02EZ17 : Is that giving back the profile info? Or info that you have given slackbot?
U6G2EGCH2 : info given to slackbot
U1BP42MRS : Yeah, reminders are the big one for me
U29163YQH : only use it for reminders
U1BP42MRS : Though really that is the slack app, slackbot is just the deliverer of the message since it's slash commands
U4BMZ90T0 : Hey <@U1BP42MRS> what's a good substitution for the `f'{datetime.datetime.now():%Y-%m-%d}.xlsx'` formatting
U4BMZ90T0 : Can't use it in 3.6
U1BP42MRS : `"{:%Y-%m-%d}.xlsx".format(datetime.datetime.now())` I think
U1BP42MRS : let me double check
U1BP42MRS : ```Python 3.6.2 (default, Jul 17 2017, 16:44:45) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 8.1.0 (clang-802.0.42)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; "{:%Y-%m-%d}.xlsx".format(datetime.datetime.now())
'2017-07-31.xlsx'
```

That's 3.6.2 but should be backwards compatible

U4BMZ90T0 : Okay cool
U4BMZ90T0 : Also, another quick question
U4BMZ90T0 : Was working with a bunch of dictionaries all parts of `tkinter` for different object
U4BMZ90T0 : On my computer some keys were shown as `!branches` or likewise
U4BMZ90T0 : denoted as a string with `!` prepended
U4BMZ90T0 : but on a coworkers computer in some cases the keys were completely random numeric strings
U4BMZ90T0 : and I had to grab data another way, can you think of a reason for this?
U1BP42MRS : Are you talking about internal tkinter apis?
U4BMZ90T0 : Yeah, just going through the object attributes. I'm never touching `tkinter` again, but wasn't sure what that might be from
