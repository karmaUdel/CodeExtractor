you can use ```which python``` to check which one you are using
but i think the issue is with the library <@U5SQYT750>, :re <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1497625527626658>
3 ... and (maybe this is just a dumb question) but I was worried that installing using conda to install virtual env is not what I wanted.
but as <@U0NRYQNAZ> said, probably best to not try and mix them up
Oh, hadn't seen zappa before
when you do `which python` what comes up?
Normally the conda one.
that's where we would run into our first issue. we wouldn't want to be using the conda one. we would want something like the system python, i believe.
Right... thus my question :slightly_smiling_face:
Seems like I need to be able to deactivate conda and ‘activate' python3 (sytem would be python2) and then use virtual env.  Thanks for getting me started on the right track.
