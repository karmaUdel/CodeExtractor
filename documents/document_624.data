U5YDC1YUW : it's definitely something to wrap your head around! but I'm honestly enjoying it
U5YDC1YUW : just having a look at how I would hook this up in my code, does something like this make sense?
U5YDC1YUW : ```StartGame -&gt;
            ( { model | status = Playing }, Task.perform (\_ -&gt; Tick) (Process.sleep 1000) )
```

U17R26VR8 : that should trigger your Tick process ~1000ms after a StartGame msg comes through
U5YDC1YUW : I know in this situation I'm expecting that Tick will only be called once after 1000ms
U5YDC1YUW : alright, the compiler is having a fit haha.
U17R26VR8 : I say roughly because js has a error margin with setTimeout of &lt; 8ms i think…
U17R26VR8 : if you can’t work it out, chuck the msg here and the community will help, according to some we’re ‘excessively’ helpful
U17R26VR8 : actually that is true, last time, i needed a foldl which reduced a Result, and got 3 answers in just as many minutes
U5YDC1YUW : sure, incoming...
U5YDC1YUW : ```The 1st and 2nd branches of this `case` produce different types of values.

12|     case msg of
13|         Clicked -&gt;
14|             if model.status == Playing then
15|                 processClick model
16|             else
17|                 ( model, Cmd.none )
18| 
19|         StartGame -&gt;
20|&gt;            ( { model | status = Playing }, Task.perform (\_ -&gt; Tick) (Process.sleep 1000) )
21| 
22|         Tick _ -&gt;
23|             updateTime model

The 1st branch has this type:

    ( { click_count : Int
    , click_limit : Int
    , points : Int
    , status : Status
    , targets : List Target
    , time_elapsed : Int
    , time_limit : Int
    }
    , Cmd (Msg)
    )

But the 2nd is:

    ( { click_count : Int
    , click_limit : Int
    , points : Int
    , status : Status
    , targets : List Target
    , time_elapsed : Int
    , time_limit : Int
    }
    , Cmd (Time.Time -&gt; Msg)
    )
```

U17R26VR8 : Your Tick tag doens’t have a value, but your update function is expecting one
U17R26VR8 : change ln 22: `Tick -&gt;`
U5YDC1YUW : ah brilliant! good spot :slightly_smiling_face:
U5YDC1YUW : that was leftover crud from when I was using `Time.every second Tick`
U17R26VR8 : yes, you can pass values along with the tick if you want and that’s how you’d do it
U17R26VR8 : `(\_ -&gt; Tick valueToUpdateInASecond)`
U5YDC1YUW : awesome, thanks for your help mate :slightly_smiling_face: got myself a working timer!
U17R26VR8 : My task is complete. I shall go back to work.
U5YDC1YUW : :sunglasses:

U5YFL1QNB : Is anyone else having these difficulties?
U5YFL1QNB : Ah! The issue is caused by the new package-lock.json
U17J54S2U : Yeah I’ve encountered so many errors when I upgraded to node 8 and npm 5, I just downgraded to LTS 6 and npm 4.
U0EUHKVGB : <@U5YFL1QNB> That seems very strange, can you open an issue forit here? <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform>
U5YFL1QNB : Will do
U5YFL1QNB : <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform/issues/210>
U0EUHKVGB : <@U5YFL1QNB> Can you amend it to have the smallest possible reproduction steps?
