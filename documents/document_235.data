U4TPC6XV0 : have their own .pem files
U2QGELSTS : this is one of the reasons we're recommending people migrate from RTM (where persistent connections per team are likely open in each process, therefore this routing concern exists) to Web API + Events API (where you just need a store accessible from each process that contains the a valid token for each team).
U2QGELSTS : <@U4TPC6XV0>: that tutorial is very specific to running on linux. earlier, another member in here mentioned it didn't work right on mac either.
U2QGELSTS : perhaps this tutorial might be a useful introduction for you, it has a python example app and explains the use of some our latest tools: <https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/enhancing-slacks-events-api-7535827829ab>
U4Q5V5VT6 : Hi everyone! We're all giddy and jumpy to announce the launch of a completely new <http://Recast.AI|Recast.AI>! In this newest version, we've integrated new tools to make your experience seamless and provide you all keys to build a bot from A to Z ! That includes a Bot Connector, a Bot Hosting, a Bot Analytics, a newer and stronger artificial intelligence, a reworked training module and an improved interface :slightly_smiling_face:
Give it a go and let us know what you think! We're also on PH, so don't hesitate to support us there :slightly_smiling_face: <https://www.producthunt.com/posts/recast-ai-2-0>

U4U6P9L1M : Does botkit do SMS?
U0V93GE5R : <https://www.npmjs.com/package/botkit-sms>
U0V93GE5R : not in the main branch yet, but this and some other options are in the pipeline
U0V93GE5R : <@U429PB4DT> Please stay on topic in general (unless this pertains to bot building?)
U4U6P9L1M : What is conversation management?
U4U6P9L1M : I found this here <https://github.com/botpress/botpress-botkit>
```
Apart from being awesome, Botkit is the most popular open-source bot development tool. If you've been playing with Botpress a bit, you probably noticed that it lacks a conversation management system (which Botkit offers). Our philosophy at Botpress is to have a small &amp; powerful core and leverage the best tools available by integrating them as Modules.

U1DM2B4SY : A system that allows for a question-answer type dialogue
U4U6P9L1M : Thanks adambeliveau
U4VPP4T9U : anyone here who can help me with <http://api.ai|api.ai>?
U1DM2B4SY : <#C0RBKNXPZ|api-ai> would likely be a good place to start
U4VPP4T9U : is their anyway of sending multi message response in <http://api.ai|api.ai>? Eg: when user say( Turn off the lights) <http://api.ai|api.ai> should say (on it) and then say(Lights are now off)
U4TUP41HT : my bot name is Travibot but <http://Api.ai|Api.ai> cannot differentiate betweeen Bot and Travibot.  Any one who can help to find solution
U4V5ZLU4C : Hey y'all. New here. Wondering if there's a resource for language and copy in bots that you trust.
U4VRLFWCX : Hi y'all. I'm new to chatbot world. Can anybody point out to me any blog to read regarding where botkit stands in the middle of the bot puzzle? I mean is it replacing the 'django' version of self made bot or else?
U04SM6T2H : hey <@U4V5ZLU4C> :0
U04SM6T2H : <@U4VRLFWCX> you can think of it sort of like Express for bots
U4VRLFWCX : <@U04SM6T2H> thanks for quick reply! I would like to build chatbot using botkit. Should I host it in heroku? And would it be possible to extend the reach to LINE, telegram and other platforms other than Messenger or is it limited to the ones mentioned in website?
U04SM6T2H : you can do it on heroku or most other hosts
U04SM6T2H : we do not have native support for line or telegram but it is not too hard to add new platforms
U04SM6T2H : that said, through the microsoft bot framework connector, we do have access to Telegram and others.
U04SM6T2H : <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/readme-botframework.md>

U4U6P9L1M : Ok I can't see a place in botkit on how to save data to postgres or another datastore.
U4U6P9L1M : Where can I find this info?
U4U6P9L1M : Found this <https://github.com/lixhq/botkit-storage-postgres>
U4U6P9L1M : Is there a way to get the thread UI in the botkit studio to make a request to an external server and wait for a response?
U4VDY5ED9 : anyone here versed in the php "slack-client" from sagebind? I'm trying to figure out how to add buttons but i'm having a hard time understanding his api
U4TPM36MU : Wow, I just barely saw this. Still need help?
U419E6R60 : Hey have a question regarding  the `ts` field in a slack message. Why is there a decimal value?
U419E6R60 : `ts: '1491516461.920336'`
U419E6R60 : this issue tries to explain it -&gt; <https://github.com/slackhq/slack-api-docs/issues/7>
U419E6R60 : also, how does slack create an epoch time like that?
U419E6R60 : i've never seen one with a decimal value
U0554MQJB : <@U419E6R60> it's a pretty painful quirk in slack data, it's an attempt to make a unique id for messages
U419E6R60 : ok so it is not necessary to include a time stamp when sending messages -- i was worried that i would have to make a timestamp like the above
U272P5K71 : Technically they're fraction notation, but practically it's for uniqueness
U272P5K71 : they act as both a message timestamp and a message ID when combined with another ID, e.g. `channel_id` + `ts`
U272P5K71 : we don't recommend relying entirely on `ts` for uniqueness due to possible (but unlikely) ID collisions
U272P5K71 : See Paul's response on that gh issue:&gt;&gt;&gt;The first are properties that are unix timestamps, usually indicating when something was created or updated, usually called “created” or “edited”. These should all be integers (although it's possible, despite checking several times recently, that we've missed one).

The second are the message timestamps, which always use the “ts” name (eg: “ts”, “event_ts”). These are returned as strings. Even though they look like floats, they should always be stored and compared as strings - because floats occasionally lose precision and that would be bad here.

The bit after the decimal point is a sequence that guarantees uniqueness and ordering:

A message in a channel will have a unique TS for that channel (two messages in two different channels can have the same TS).
If message A is posted before message B then A's TS will be less than B's.
Knowing all that, it becomes clear that the “timestamp” property on files is badly named. We've just introduced a new “created” property that better describes what it is, which will be returned by our APIs from today onwards. We'll maintain backwards compatibility by supporting the old “timestamp” property too.

U419E6R60 : Thanks
U4V4JLU6L : hello! I have a question that keeps bothering me, is it possible to get data from certain time range using slack api? I haven't found anything like this but this would help a ton for our project we are working on
U4V4JLU6L : let's say I'm using im.history, can I fetch only messages that are for example 1 month old or younger?
U4R5KRXSQ : <@U4V4JLU6L> yes, you should be able to pass in the oldest(start time) to latest(defaults to now).. referencing <https://api.slack.com/methods/im.history>
U4V4JLU6L : could you show me how such query would look like?
U4V4JLU6L : for now I am using something like this: /im.history?token=${accessToken}&amp;channel=${id}&amp;pretty=1
U4V4JLU6L : Nvm I managed to make it work with im.history. Thank you!
U4VS6HW67 : hi
U4VS6HW67 : im jerome
U4VS6HW67 : We are looking for someone who programmed us a simple bot.
U3J1JQTU4 : which kind of bot ?
U4U6P9L1M : Is there a reason that all the bot frameworks I'm looking at are all about getting a bot deployed easily with little understanding of what it's doing and no mention of maintenance. Is it that people using them don't know how to code? I doubt it.
U4FSUJLLU : Hi guys i have a problem merging two objects any idea how can i do this ?

```controller.hears('offres','message_received, facebook_postback',function(bot,message){

	connection.connect("<mongodb://localhost/bot>",function(err,db){
		var z ="";
		var data = db.collection('offres').find().toArray().then(function(data){
			for (var i =0 ; i&lt;10; i++){
				var _under = require("underscore");
				var titre = data[i]['titre'];
				var ref = data[i]['ref'].toString();
				var description = data[i]['description'];
			
    			b = setpayload(titre,description, ref,'<https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/01/13/17/29/hiring-1977803_960_720.jpg>');
  				z= _under.extend(z, b);
  			}
    		bot.reply(message,{
    			attachment:{
                'type': 'template',
                'payload': {
                    'template_type': 'generic',
                    'elements':[z	]
        		}}
    		}) 

    		

		})
	});
});

function setpayload(titre,sub, ref, image)
{
	var m = {
                'title': titre,
                'image_url': image,
                'subtitle': sub,
                'buttons': [
                               
                    {
                        'type': 'postback',
                        'title': 'postuler',
                        'payload': ref
                    },
                    {
                        'type': 'postback',
                        'title': 'plus de détail',
                                    'payload': ref
                    }
                ]
            }
            
    return m ;
}```

i want to add slides to the generic attachement

if it is just one slide it works just fine like this :
```controller.hears('offres','message_received, facebook_postback',function(bot,message){

	connection.connect("<mongodb://localhost/bot>",function(err,db){

		var data = db.collection('offres').find().toArray().then(function(data){

			var _under = require("underscore");
			var titre = data[0]['titre'];
			var ref = data[0]['ref'].toString();
			var description = data[0]['description'];
			
    		b = setpayload(titre,description, ref,'<https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/01/13/17/29/hiring-1977803_960_720.jpg>');
  			
  			
    		bot.reply(message,{
    			attachment:{
                'type': 'template',
                'payload': {
                    'template_type': 'generic',
                    'elements':[b]
        		}}
    		}) 

    		

		})
	});
});

function setpayload(titre,sub, ref, image)
{
	var m = {
                'title': titre,
                'image_url': image,
                'subtitle': sub,
                'buttons': [
                               
                    {
                        'type': 'postback',
                        'title': 'postuler',
                        'payload': ref
                    },
                    {
                        'type': 'postback',
                        'title': 'plus de détail',
                                    'payload': ref
                    }
                ]
            }
            
    return m ;
}
```
But when i can't figure out how to add others automatically :confused:
