What does the ! operator do?   I've been reading through the elm-datepicker code and came across some lines that look like this: ```prepareDates (prevMonth currentMonth) model ! []```
<@U6ECA0Q4D> it's short hand for `(model, Cmd.none)` ... it makes a tuple
<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Platform-Cmd#>!
So what is valid in the array?  Just commands?
`List (Cmd msg)`
Ah, that's where it is in the docs!  I couldn't find it.  Thanks!
yeah.. searching for infix operators is weird i googled `elm "! []"` to find that
Thanks for the help <@U3HQVHERX>.  I'm trying to wrap my head around the elm architecture and functional programming and it's kicking my butt
<@U6ECA0Q4D> no problem! it's worth the effort. my advice: use the `elm-repl` as a sandbox to learn features of the language and use <https://ellie-app.com/new> for small case studies
<@U3HQVHERX> what does your Webpack config file look like?
Config looks good. You could try removing debug: true from the options line to see if that changes anything. 
tried that : /
when i run the webpack dev server it does not output a bundle js file though, so that's weird
I'm a little stuck and not sure if I should reach for a library or roll my own solution.
I'm sending the last character of an `onInput` Event out libphonenumber-google for formatting. I want to get it back and then use that to update the input field.
I also want to track a backspace to send another message out to the AsYouType formmater to pop off the last number
<@U0JBSEGHY>, so are you using a port to send it out to that libphonenumber-google service?
Regarding the backspace, you can add your own custom event listener that listens for that key code.
Yea I have it on the client side. So I am just working with it as some external JS client side
I just realised I probably also have to track deletes and cut and pastes as well :confused: haha.
Yeah thats all no problem if you just make an even listener that takes an `Int -&gt; Msg`
Do you need any help making that kind of thing? And regarding the google service, why dont you use a port to send back whatever it is you wanted in Elm?
I think I might have to sit down and map it all out. I also want to accept letters and treat it as a search bar as well.
I have a port sending it back and showing the result elsewhere but I would like to also format the input field.
This is a little more fancy than I initially thought it would be haha
