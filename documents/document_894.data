U1BP42MRS : Docker!
U1BP42MRS : I put a `docker-compose.yml` in all my projects now so people can be up and running with it in a few minutes
U1BP42MRS : It won't solve all problems, but it's really nice for dev-prod parity, ish
U5LNXQHN3 : <@U5NMSURAQ> I didn't say the functionality was slow or bad, just that there isn't so much of it
U5NMSURAQ : true that
U5NMSURAQ : but I'd guess the most useful stuff is already there
U4BMZ90T0 : Does anyone know if there is any possible way to figure out the proper URL for an API call? I have an issue with an API im trying to work with that basically one of the URL parameters can be changed server side and the guy who maintains the server might as well be AWOL. So basically is there any to see the endpoints available if I make a request to the parent endpoint of the endpoint I don't know?Example - `<http://crucible.server.com/{unknown-endpoint-name}>`
I'd imagine if there is no WADL or some sort of blueprint for a given server than probably not

U6AFDVDA9 : hello, question related to something i asked yesterday.
i have a small web app that allows users to search instagram for two hashtags.  on the first page they enter their hashtags, on the second page they get the results and a button to process more results.  clicking this button send the user to a URL with the next page token and the hash tags (required for processing next results) stored in the url. like this `<http://10.51.50.10:42066/results/J0HWW-lwQAAAF0HWW-jjgAAAFoAKAA%253D%253D/%5B%27lol%27%2C%20%27dog%27%5D>?`

my problem is i keep getting this error and i'm not sure what it means 

```
werkzeug.routing.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'results' with values ['tags']. Did you forget to specify values ['token']?

```

this is the route
```
@app.route('/results/', methods=['GET', 'POST'], defaults={'token': None, 'tags': None})
@app.route('/results/&lt;token&gt;/&lt;tags&gt;', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def results(token, tags):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        tags = request.form['text'].replace(' ', '').split(',')
        data = fetch_data(tags=tags, next_page_token=token)
        processed_data, token = process_data(data=data, tags=tags)

    if request.method == 'GET':
        <http://logging.info|logging.info>("TOKEN: {}".format(token))
        <http://logging.info|logging.info>("TAGS: {}".format(tags))
        data = fetch_data(tags=tags, next_page_token=token)
        processed_data, token = process_data(data=data, tags=tags)
        return render_template('results.html', data=processed_data[:1], token=token, tags=tags)

    return render_template('results.html', data=processed_data[:1], token=token, tags=tags)
```
and this is the template
```
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body style="background-color:powderblue;"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;{{ data }}&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;form action="{{ url_for('next', token=token, tags=tags) }}"&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="More results plz" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

U6AFDVDA9 : any thoughts?

U5NMSURAQ : ```from flask import Flask

def results(token, tags):
    return 'OK'
```

U5NMSURAQ : Strange indeed.
U6AFDVDA9 : one thought i just had
U6AFDVDA9 : my token and tag vars come through as ```
INFO:root:TOKEN: J0HWW-lwQAAAF0HWW-jjgAAAFoAKAA%3D%3D
INFO:root:TAGS: ['lol', 'dog']
```

U6AFDVDA9 : could the tags coming through as a python data structure as a string have somethign to do with it?
U6AFDVDA9 : i've been banging my head on this for hours.  and you saying strange indeed gave me some validation that is helping me to not go crazy haha
U5NMSURAQ : wait, what do you mean coming through as a python data structure?
U6AFDVDA9 : it's getting placed in the url like this `['lol', 'dog']` but encoded
U6AFDVDA9 : `/%5B%27lol%27%2C%20%27dog%27%5D?`
U5NMSURAQ : Works either way :confused:
