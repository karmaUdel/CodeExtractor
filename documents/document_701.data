Sure, let me explore `futures`. So, I'll be doing I/O with these forked processes. Reading from the web, suggestions are to keep workers equal to number of cores. Is that reasonable?
Yep, that's usually what I see/hear around. Note that if you are doing I/O - probably best to use `ThreadPoolExecutor` since your bottlekneck isn't CPU and processes in python are expensive
Especially resource sharing
Thanks. Let me read more on the subject
Hello guys
I got a problem, I want to connect my self to an external site using python requests.
What I aim to have at the end is a way by which I can connect myself to the site using python requests and when I open my browser, I should see myself already logged in
But the problem is when I connect myself using python requests and I open thee browser I'm not logged in
Here's my code
Being logged in is stored in a cookie. Requests has one set of cookies, your browser has another set of cookies
OK I see. And how can I make them communicate then
and ne'er shall the twain ever meet
You'd need to be able to inject the cookies into whatever the browser uses to manage them, which sounds difficult
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35495416/importing-request-session-cookies-to-browser>
I mean, seems possible using selenium
if you wanted to go the other way
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/browser-cookie3/0.6.0>
so, you have a number of problems
<@U0LSCQQNR> selenium is it a python module or what ?
* Browser cookie storage location path varies by browser and OS.  How will you handle all that?
I'll rather try to import requests session cookies to the browser
good luck
what's the use case?
<@U0LSCQQNR> use case ?
what is the purpose behind this?
how do you expect it to be useful?
how do you see someone using this?
<@U0LSCQQNR> I'm trying to implement a Single sign on system on a Wi-Fi and an external website. I want that every person connected on my Wi-Fi to be automatically logged in to that website
I once mentioned it here
so how is this supposed to work with that?
<@U5UKKT0EP> Thanks! I'll try that :smile:
<@U5JF1KD18> I regularly use *mechanize* to access websites where you have to login etc...
and fill out forms in general. *mechanize* emulates a webbrowser.
If I have a question that isn't really about Python can I still ask it here? Or do I need to go to general or random?
It is development related at least
why not?
if its not, we could probably point you in a direction
I'm trying to implement a class that create a 2d array, but I'm running into some issues with `__getitem__`
<@U4BMZ90T0>, are you using a dict?
No, using a list.
Basically just taking a 2d array of N x M
and I have to sum all the values in the columns
I'd argue that it's probably not worth trying to go overboard on the overloads
Which is easy enough
My trouble comes in here
Basically saying that `__getitem__` is not defined for list
but I've defined it in my class. And it works if my 2d list isn't an object instance
of my class
You're assuming it's saying the wrong thing about your class, but most likely you have given it a list when you think you've given it your class
How should I initialize the list in my class then
No idea, you're showing only tiny snippets of code and we've not seen the actual error or the actual structure yet
Alright let me do this then one sec
The error comes in line 4 with `self.xl_grid[i][j-1]`
okay, so obviously your __getitem__ function is irrelevant as you're not dealing with that type here, only lists
Oh wait
Personally I wouldn't be trying to implement that logic in a single hairy one-liner, either
Yeah i think that's what's broken
what is the _actual_ error?
The error I had previously was due to attempting to subscript the list twice
it was giving me a message about the list
But not it's not making a 2d array, but that was my fault
Works now
And that requires that Postgres be installed on my local machine. Is there any way around this? Do I _have to_ install Postgres on my computer?
how are you working locally?
eg, dev/staging/prod with their own specific env configurations
I just run my code locally...um...I guess that's it. I have the Heroku toolbelt. When I run the command with the toolbet I'm informed that psql.exe could not be found. After a quick search it seems it's because Postgres needs to be installed.
Sorry if I didn't understand your question correctly
I run my app in its development configuration when running it locally. Not that it's that much different from the other modes.
How can you be running locally if you use Postgres but don't have it installed? Are you accessing a Postgres instance remotely?
I didn't think Heroku had a local option
it does, but you really should have everything replicated locally that's on heroky
as close to 1:1 as possible
Aha. Still curious about how it handles the DB.
Ya I have no idea. I just want to get PostGIS running on Heroku. But I guess I'll need Postgres anyway if I intend to test my app locally. Currently I just plug it into an SQLite DB to test it.
yup, switch that out for postgres.
I must say that I did enjoy the simplicity though, and especially when we have new developers coming in. I wish Postgres could be self-contained somehow to avoid having to set anything up. Oh well.
That's the tradeoff though... SQLite basically has the whole database functionality built right into your application. That's only practical because the functionality it offers is quite minimal.
If you're writing something for multiple developers to work on then everybody could share a Postgres installation on a central server
That's true. I suppose I could have everyone connect to the database on the Heroku staging Dyno for the project though...
Hello. Anyone with experience in django-filer and django-storage (i.e. s3) ?
try <#C0LMFRMB5|django>
<@U5LNXQHN3> what
&gt; That's only practical because the functionality it offers is quite minimal.
SQLite's Full-text search was blazing fast before Postgres had a reasonable FTS at all.
Docker!
I put a `docker-compose.yml` in all my projects now so people can be up and running with it in a few minutes
It won't solve all problems, but it's really nice for dev-prod parity, ish
<@U5NMSURAQ> I didn't say the functionality was slow or bad, just that there isn't so much of it
true that
but I'd guess the most useful stuff is already there
I'd imagine if there is no WADL or some sort of blueprint for a given server than probably not
anyone comfortable with marshmallow? ,trying to remove missing data after deserialization ,i don't want `{'first_field': &lt;marshmallow.missing&gt;, 'second_field': u'some value'}`
