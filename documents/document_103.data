U1C03090C : Not yet. Posted an issue on the github but no answers. 
U3L6TFEJF : with Specter: ```(s/setval [s/MAP-KEYS s/NAMESPACE] "your-ns" your-map)```
U3L6TFEJF : with regular clojure you're gonna have to do the usual for-loop dance (or something like it): ```(into {} (for [[k v] your-map] [(keyword (name k) "your-ns") v]))```

U3JURM9B6 : Anyone here using <http://nd4j.org/> ? This library shows up first for "java ndarray", but reading the docs, this project seems to have a very high opinion of itself (and I can't find other people using it.)
U051HUZLD : Is following "thread safe"? Can there be a race condition?```(reset! db @db)
```
e.g. changed `db` value between `deref` and `reset!`

U053XQP4S : unsafe
U3L6TFEJF : the value can change
U3L6TFEJF : for the behavior you want, use <http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/compare-and-set>!

U3LURNK5W : Is there a way to time all sub-calls of a fn?
U3LURNK5W : let's say i have:```(defn foo [x]
         (-&gt; (foo-1 x)
               foo-2
               foo-3))```

U3LURNK5W : ofc i can do ```(time (foo x))```
U3LURNK5W : but can i get the timings of the calls to foo-1,foo-2,foo-3 without wrapping each fn?
U04V1HS2L : Is there any way (lib?) to rerun only "failed-last-time" clojure.test vars?
U051HUZLD : <@U3LURNK5W> have a look at <https://github.com/thunknyc/profile>
U3LURNK5W : thx
U051HUZLD : what would be a use case for this? <https://github.com/weavejester/medley/blob/1.0.0/src/medley/core.cljc#L273>same as `swap!`, but returns atom's previous value (before it was successfully swapped)

U053XQP4S : <@U051HUZLD> ```
(def queue (atom clojure.lang.PersistentQueue/EMPTY))

(defn push! [x]
  (swap! queue conj x))

(defn pull! []
  (-&gt; queue (deref-swap! pop) peek))
```

U1Q12R4F2 : Hello everyone, I have an app which stores documents (edn/json files, size from 100kb up to 1000kb) and I want to save the whole change-history (changes will be small, max 30kb maybe, but frequently) without storing the whole document for each change. Is there a free document database which supports document history with delta encoding?
U06FTAZV3 : <@U1Q12R4F2> Datomic comes close to doing what you want, but it's not an exact match.
U053XQP4S : git ?
