```
there's probably a better way to rewrite`(cons 'quote (list decls))` - that's super ugly
it works if i just do `(list 'quote decls)`
oh, right, much nicer
wow, thanks for explaining that to me as always
definitely would not have picked up on that on my own
yeah, there's an art to this stuff, and seeing simple examples makes a difference in learning it
tbh i never cared much about macros before the project i'm using this for
it's funny because in scheme i'm pretty sure i'd do some fancy transformation like closure conversion, but that's not possible since clojure is JIT compiled at the function level. but otoh, i don't think i could do it this way with scheme-style macros
now i get to play around with techniques for parsing the asts. i'll check out the muir library, but suspect i'll end up having to hack away at it myself
