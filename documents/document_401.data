U0LPMPL2U : it returns a `Task` that you can turn into a `Cmd`
U2DSBB76Y : Awesome, thanks! :raised_hands:
U2DSBB76Y : Btw, it did return a `Task` :smile:
U0LPMPL2U : typically you don't care to do anything after the focus has happened so I typically just use a `Noop` message
U0LPMPL2U : ```focus : Cmd Msg
focus =
    Dom.focus "search-box"
        |&gt; Task.attempt (always Noop)
```

U0LPMPL2U : where `"search-box"` is an id on the input
U0LPMPL2U : It get's triggered in an `update` function like:
```
 OpenSelect -&gt;
            ( { model | state = Open }, focus )
```

U2DSBB76Y : Cool, I've never really used `always` before! Neat
U5GSY0G9J : So i have this container that has a date picker in it and it is being built with a port. Right now i have to call the port everytime i switch the view in that container. Is there a better way to do this other than calling that port on all the buttons that switch to that view?
U0LPMPL2U : The port calling would be done in the `update`, not on the buttons right?
U0LPMPL2U : your probably have a Msg like:```
TransitionTo page -&gt; (transitionTo page model, triggerPort)
```

U37BS6J6N : Ello all, what is the simplest way to work with design heavy views that need to be responsive. Working with bootstrap is pretty painful atm.I"m debating trying elmx
<https://github.com/pzavolinsky/elmx>

U1CE9DL9H : what exactly is problematic?
U1CE9DL9H : and how would another way of writing html help?, the default elm html is really nice once you have worked with it a little bit
U37BS6J6N : I'm trying to translate existing bootstrap html into sections of Html
U1CE9DL9H : are you familiar with <http://elm-bootstrap.info/>
U37BS6J6N : I played with it a bit
U37BS6J6N : I've also attempted to use the Html2Elm but keep getting Text "" all over the place.
U37BS6J6N : is elmx bad?
U37BS6J6N : Or just not recommended?
U0CLDU8UB : joelq: And even pieces of the signature!```
type alias WebDataTask success =
    Decoder success -&gt; Value -&gt; String -&gt; Task Never (WebData success)

-- ...

taskFnToCmdFn : WebDataTask success -&gt; WebDataCmd success msg
```

U0CLDU8UB : That's pretty involved though, I don't really recommend it :slightly_smiling_face:
U1CE9DL9H : definitely not recommended, those empty text nodes are not harmful and you can easily delete them in your editor
U1CE9DL9H : after you run the formatter, select all `, text ""` and delete
U37BS6J6N : <@U1CE9DL9H> any idea why? It seems natural for folks coming from react. Fixing syntax errors for Text for huge chunks is definitely a sub optimal experience. Also it does break my code if I just try to leave them in.
U37BS6J6N : Did elmx break a bunch ?
U1CE9DL9H : because the html in elm is actually just elm, and so all the things that make elm nice apply to it
U1CE9DL9H : type checking, not making typo's, formatting
U1CE9DL9H : also the empty text nodes shouldn't do anything, what breaks?
U0CLDU8UB : Okay that's very strange
