```
create a text snippet
yeah context is still not final in react.js. i dont like context but who cares what i like :wink:
it'd be fine if I didn't have to write contextTypes like that
messes up the cleanness of writing `export default class Foo extends React.Component {`
I've used context for a year now :wink: and i prefer react.createclass still because of a couple of these problems...
this.context.hipster
:stuck_out_tongue:
yeah I guess maybe I should stick to createClass for now
hehe my friend actually found it before any documentation came out, hes crazy
jumping the gun a bit
