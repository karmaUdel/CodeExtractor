U2D7NUGS1 : The thing is that on Thursday I'm giving a presentation about Elm for local meetup group and now I'm frantically preparing. So can't promise anything. I'll put a reminder for that in my calendar and get back to, probably later next week.
U3SJEDR96 : No rush, really, but I'd massively appreciate it :slightly_smiling_face:
U2D7NUGS1 : I really think it's a great initiative. I'm one of those who learn by experimenting, so I'll gladly help you.
U2D7NUGS1 : Just coming two weeks will be very intensive for me.
U2D7NUGS1 : I really appreciate your help.
U2D7NUGS1 : Are you Dutch?
U3SJEDR96 : Belgian, but I do speak Dutch
U2D7NUGS1 : Well, I'm in Netherlands, but I don't speak yet.
U3SJEDR96 : Where is your meetup at?
U2D7NUGS1 : It's in den Bosch: <https://www.meetup.com/Frontend-Developers-Javascript-Noord-Brabant/events/240756426/>
U2D7NUGS1 : That's even better: ```decodeData : Decode.Value -&gt; String
decodeData json =
    case Decode.decodeValue (<http://Decode.at|Decode.at> [ "statuz" ] Decode.string) json of
        Ok value -&gt;
            value

        Err message -&gt;
            Debug.crash message
```

U2D7NUGS1 : :boom: :smile:
U3SJEDR96 : Ah, too bad I can't make it there, I'd have loved to see that :slightly_smiling_face:
U2D7NUGS1 : I hope it will be recorded.
U2D7NUGS1 : You may take a look at <https://github.com/lzrski/elm-polymer/tree/pre-publish>
U2D7NUGS1 : It's work in progress. Unpublished and very poorly documented.
U2D7NUGS1 : What I'm trying to do now is reimplement the scaffolding script in Elm. It's getting too hairy for shell scripting.
U2D7NUGS1 : Basically I'm trying to generate Elm code with Elm program :slightly_smiling_face:
U2G4P6QJ2 : Is there some convenient syntax for "updating" these kind of types? -&gt;```
type MyType = MyType Int String
```
I know for records I can do this:
```
{ record | someField = someValue }
```
But for the first kind I keep desctructuring the type and "rebuilding" it from scratch every time..

U3LT1UTPF : If it's recorded, please share (I also speak Dutch)
U3LT1UTPF : <@U2D7NUGS1> ^^
U2G4P6QJ2 : Right now I do this:```
changeNr : MyType -&gt; Int-&gt; MyType
changeNr (MyType _ str) newNr = MyType newNr str
```

U48AEBJQ3 : <@U2G4P6QJ2> You are already doing the right thing.
U48AEBJQ3 : Although, `MyType` should be the last parameter. It makes pipelining easier.
U48AEBJQ3 : And you might do `mapNr : (String -&gt; String) -&gt; MyType -&gt; MyType`
U2G4P6QJ2 : Thanks a lot <@U48AEBJQ3>. I will keep that in mind, it makes perfect sense.
U62Q5C999 : Hi, just started with learning elm. Coming from react redux. I wonder is there something like redux store in elm? Some global state container and message bus to change it?
U2G4P6QJ2 : Yes there is. Check out the docs on "The Elm Architecture". <https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/>.
