U5NMSURAQ : ... come to think of it, if you don't do any processing at all, you can just skip this method
U5NMSURAQ : if you don't implement it yourself, an original one will be used from `list`
U5JG72GA2 : well I'm just practicing with `super`. Let's say I want to log or print before `__len()__` is executed
U5JG72GA2 : ok why do I have to use `return`?
U3G7RJP61 : You're saying return the result of my parent classes `len` method.
U5JG72GA2 : ok so I did this as well but no return was necessary:```
class MyDict(dict):
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        print("adding key: {} and value: {}".format(key, value))
        super(MyDict, self).__setitem__(key, value)

    def __getattr__(self, key):
        if key not in self:
            return 'key not recognized'
        else:
            return self[key]

```

U5NMSURAQ : `setitem` doesn't return anything useful
U5NMSURAQ : and there is a return statement in your `getattr` :))
U5JG72GA2 : ah I see
U0L051JUB : What is the best way to convert a list to a dict? The only thing is I want to specify my keys from outside the list. So the list is basically the values of the dict and I will provide the keys separately.
U5NMSURAQ : ```&gt;&gt;&gt; values = ['one', 'two', 'three']
&gt;&gt;&gt; keys = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = dict(zip(keys, values))
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
```

U0L051JUB : Perfect exactly what I was looking for.
U5WD1KS5P : Hey guys, I'm new to deploying django applications and I've been fighting an issue for two days now, could anyone help me with this? <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44666555/django-wsgi-no-module-named-site> I just posted a question in stack overflow and I'm completely stuck at the moment
U1BP42MRS : <@U5WD1KS5P> I think you have a type-o in your question:
```
activate_this = os.path.join( PROJECT_DIR, 'env/shinra/bin', 'activate_this.py'$
```

The `$` is invalid and would cause a syntax error

U5WD1KS5P : oh yeah let me edit that, thanks!
U1BP42MRS : Otherwise, some questions:
1. Where are you running the `python3 -i ...wsgi.py` command from? The app may not be in your PYTHONPATH
2. Why are you not using  uwsgi or gunicorn to serve the app, vs trying to run it directly?

U5WD1KS5P : ive tried running it from both /var/www/shinra/ and var/www/shinra/shinra
U5WD1KS5P : I ran it with uwsgi and gunicorn both and was able to get them both to serve the app (without the static files) but I was never able to configure either apache or nginx correctly for my EC2 instance
U5WD1KS5P : And the tutorials to configure either of those are old
U1BP42MRS : If you're at all familiar with ansible, here is how I have my recent Django app served from gunicorn 
U1BP42MRS : <https://github.com/mrasband/ansible/blob/master/ottter.yml>
U5WD1KS5P : Oh no idea, but the line exec_start seems to be what I ran when I tried with gunicorn and that worked perfectly so being able to run that as a bash or something would be great
U5WD1KS5P : My question there would be, is it ok to run the gunicorn command to start serving the app, store that command to run on server start and just use nginx to feed my static files?
