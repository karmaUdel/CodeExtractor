U39DE7RQ9 : A more specific question. Im trying to reach a plain html page I created in the root of my app next to index.html and index.js called auth.html but I get a 404 when opening localhost:3000/auth.html. Why is that and how can go around it?
U6AU4N1HR : Can I use Http.send and send a command message containng additional data aside from result of the actual send?In the example here: <http://lpaste.net/357143>, I need to send the user record in UserBooksFetched msg, but however i try, the compailer complaints

U6AU4N1HR : I hope it at least makes sense
U4872964V : Well, Elm does not really work that way. I know <@U0L8LGP9U> is working on a library to do this, and I put together this ugly beast over my html5 dragdrop library, but we are still figuring these things out unfortunately
U4872964V : Check out <https://ellie-app.com/KvQXcHVwGfa1/2> for my attempt
U39DE7RQ9 : Webpack help anyone? I have copy and pasted the code in webpack.config.js from the Elm tutorial (<https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/04-starting/03-webpack-1.html>) and now I need it to output some additional .html files. How do I do that? The files are placed in the src folder of my app
U236M9FH9 : <@U39DE7RQ9> Pretty sure you just run `webpack` instead of webpack-dev-server &amp; it should be available in your `output.path`
U39DE7RQ9 : When i develop my app I run yarn start. So how do I just run webpack <@U236M9FH9> ?
U236M9FH9 : node_modules/.bin/webpack
U39DE7RQ9 : OK will try
U236M9FH9 : Usually I add add something like this to package.json:```
"scripts": { "build": "webpack" } 
```
then just run `npm run build` or `yarn run build`

U39DE7RQ9 : Mine looks like this:```
"scripts": {
    "build": "webpack",
    "client": "webpack-dev-server --port 3000",
    "start": "nf start"
  }
```

U39DE7RQ9 : When I run webpack it outputs the same as when I run the dev-server. I need it to include som extra files from the src folder. How do I do that?
U39DE7RQ9 : Shouldn't this copy all of my .html files to the output folder?```
{
        test:    /\.html$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loader:  'file-loader?name=[name].[ext]',
      }
```

U236M9FH9 : I think only those that're imported by your `index.js`.
U236M9FH9 : You could use the copy webpack plugin: <https://github.com/kevlened/copy-webpack-plugin>
U39DE7RQ9 : OK, thanks!
U6AU4N1HR : Hey, I'm doing Json.Decode.map5 over a JSON and creating record User. I want to add another field to that record, which is a list. The problem is, this list is not a part of JSON. I want to intiliaze record User with a empty list. Is it possible to somehow use empty list with Json.Decode.map6?
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U6AU4N1HR> The record constructor is just a regular function. You could instead go `\a b c d e -&gt; MyRecord a b c [] d e` You could also use `Json.Decode.succeed []` with the `map6`
U14Q8S4EM : You can do `succeed list`
U14Q8S4EM : `Json.Decode.succeed whateverListYouWanted`
