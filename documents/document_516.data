oh wait
that elm-package should not be there
there’s your problem
elm-reactor uses the elm-package.json closest to the source file you use
delete that and you should be good to go :slightly_smiling_face:
WOOO
it worked
i probably ran it inside src at one point and it generated that
Yeah, easy mistake to make
how do you humans break up your Msg when you start getting a lot of them? I have almost 15 now and I feel like it's going to grow out of proportion
<@U40QW928G> Mine are broken into modules.  However, I wouldn't say 20-30 is necessarily... something that needs to be broken up, unless you feel like you want to break them up (if there's a clear distinction by which you can separate them and it would make maintenance easier)
Might be that you just need to break up your update function?  (i.e. into several separate functions, possibly even modules)
yeah I have actions I'd much rather limit to players
that sounds like a potential solution, how do you break up your update function?
Well, step 1 would be to separate the logic into smaller functions (if it's all inline in the update function currently)
I like to extract everything in my `update` to other functions so that `update` is just dispatching
