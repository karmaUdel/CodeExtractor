I get a `test/readme.clj` that's nearly 400 lines long -- mostly whitespace but it does have all the ````clojure` code fragments as tests
(hard to backtick a bunch of backticks)

heh, yeah, I ran into the same problem
cool =)
<@U04V70XH6> hm I don't suppose you ever found a way to make that command exit with failure if a test fails?
also, wow, that found a lot of README errors XD
`lein test` ought to get a non-zero exit status if tests fail? (Dunno, we switched to Boot ages ago at work)
Ah, but *Midje* doesn't. Yeah that kinda sucks. 
I've always avoided Midje for... reasons... but I hadn't noticed it doesn't set an exit status in this case. 
Maybe I'll write a Boot task that does something similar :smile_cat: 
What's the idiomatic way of 'namespacing' keys in a map?
I have a map, and I want to namespace all the keys in the map (same namespace)
