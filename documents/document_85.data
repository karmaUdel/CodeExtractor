Well, I guess eastwood is not clojure.spec compliant yet. You may add an issue to <https://github.com/jonase/eastwood/issues> ?
similar issues seem to exist already: <https://github.com/jonase/eastwood/issues/207>
jumm I was hoping to be wrong. The question is rather is eastwood at fault or clojure.spec? because those expanded expressions do look suspicious
Is `clojure.core/hash` always non-negative?
no
it uses the full int range
Thanks
this might be a dumb question - it likely is - but what is the best way to define a spec in `clojure.spec` for an argument that is a function of arity 1?
is that a thing?
