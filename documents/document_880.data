U5UQKCC06 : I'm looking for a more pythonic way to achieve this:
U0PKTUWKH : Hi I need some help troubleshooting script that uses boto3
U0PKTUWKH : anyone familiar?
U1BP42MRS : Just throw out the question <@U0PKTUWKH> 
U0PKTUWKH : <@U1BP42MRS> that was bucket permission :see_no_evil::gun:
U1BP42MRS : Haha, happens all the time here too
U0PKTUWKH : is there a way to a use a wildcard in this statement?```
 print('Starting upload to S3')
    s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
    path = '/var/atlassian/application-data/jira/export'
    file_name = path + str(today) + '--0400.zip'
    s3_obj_name = str(today) + '--0400.zip'
    uploaded = s3.Bucket(bucket_name).upload_file(file_name, s3_obj_name)
    print('File' + " " + file_name + " " + 'has been uploaded')
    return uploaded
```
im looking to replace `--0400.zip` with some sort of wildcard if it is possible

U3T76H0JW : I am looking forward for help on decorators . I tried reading through several places on web but I could never get the essence of why do we use decorators in python ?
U3T76H0JW : Can someone over here take a lead and explain me  ?

U28MDQRL2 : Any good way to do a for loop where the first iteration value is different that the followings?. I'm trying to generate an unique username. Right now i have:```
        for add_to_the_last in range(10):
            if add_to_the_last == 0:
                add_to_the_last = ''

            username = f'{user.first_name} {user.last_initial}{add_to_the_last}'
            if not User.objects.filter(username=username).exist():
                break
```

It works but there must be a better way

U28MDQRL2 : well i actually forgot to add the username to the user.
U2UP91YLE : why are you doing that <@U28MDQRL2> ,testing or something else?
U5VGKQ2SY : Need some help w/ docker.When I run `docker images`:
```
REPOSITORY           TAG                  IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
<http://docker.io/nginx|docker.io/nginx>      stable-alpine        2d13ad575b6f        3 days ago          15.5 MB
```
First line in Dockerfile: `FROM nginx:stable-alpine`

When I `docker build -t linked-nginx .`, a new nginx latest is created.

U5VGKQ2SY : How do I build with nginx image that has already been pulled?
U2UP91YLE : `FROM <http://docker.io/nginx:stable-alpine|docker.io/nginx:stable-alpine>`
U5VGKQ2SY : the whole repo-name?
U5VGKQ2SY : ok
U5VGKQ2SY : nice!
U5VGKQ2SY : one last questions
U5VGKQ2SY : `COPY /home/lex/Development/` is in DockerfileProduces
```
Step 3/3 : COPY /home/lex/Development/Web /usr/share/nginx/html
lstat home/lex/Development/Web: no such file or directory
```

U5VGKQ2SY : directory exists
U5VGKQ2SY : just noticed that what is in `COPY` is correct, but different from what error shows. Missing `/` at begining
