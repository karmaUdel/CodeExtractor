<@U0K43G63U>: cool concept. what, if any, were the biggest snags you hit using botkit for facebook messenger? in regards to tracking sentiment and mood, are you using watson for that? are there any other good api's you'd recommend looking at in regards to pulling out mood from free text?
I actually didn't use botkit (sorry <@U04SM6T2H> :grin:)
<@U1T67F478>: I am using a few different APIs and some of my own logic to determine mood/emotion
There are a ton of sentiment analysis APIs that can be leveraged
DM me if you want more details!
I would highly reccomend botkit though. It was mostly due to timing and my own situation that I didn't choose botkit for this project. I've used it in the past and love it!
I think I'm confused about how botkit storage works, shouldn't it insert the teams automatically?
<@U1SSQQ02U>: that's not possible 
Thanks!
<@U1T9WRFUH>: You'll have to create your own storage provider. There is an example linked in the README. It needs to implement all the methods that that the other storage providers use (and make sure the tests pass)
<@U0K43G63U>: I dig it. Was thinking of writing myself a little CBT bot at some point.
cbt?
Continuously Botted Transmission?
You got it!!
Or maybe it's cognitive behavioral therapy, I always get those two confused.
Heh
<@U126KEXN2>: thanks! Would love to hear your thoughts. DM me!
Lemme play with it a bit. Do you have plans to bring it to Slack? I try to keep Facebook Messenger closed because FB makes my time go :hourglass_flowing_sand:
Yeah. Still exploring the best route for Slack, might make it more workplace focused but tbd
Versus just a direct port over
Makes sense, although I could totally see myself installing it on my primary Slack team just as-is
<@U1T9WRFUH>: maybe this one can help you a bit <https://github.com/FoundersAS/botkit-storage-elasticsearch>
I've an issue with displaying links when I'm using the `chat.postMessage`. It works fine when I use the webhook url but not using the api.
the messages come like this: `Question ID: &lt;https://www.abc.com/question/10803|10803&gt;.`
whereas, I want them to appear like a label which has an associated link but not displayed.
any clues, anyone?
<@U1KH878SJ>: using botkit?
no sir, I am using HTTParty directly to call the `chat.postMessage` in rails framework
<@U1KH878SJ>: in botkit you'll have to wrap your message in at least `{text: ‘my message'}` for it to work, maybe it's the same for you sorta? Worth a shot I guess :slightly_smiling_face:
