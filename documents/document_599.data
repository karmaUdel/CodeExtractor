```
This decoder will fail if any of these indices aren't present
ah that needs to be wrapped in a maybe
`        (Decode.maybe &lt;| Decode.index 2 Decode.string)`
right
the maybe needs to be around the `Decode.index`, not the `Decode.string` :thumbsup:
I thought it was :stuck_out_tongue:
it seems to work
can’t work out if I love elm or think its crazy!!
maybe it’s wrong to compare to JS
but with JSON decoding seems so much code :confused:
this slack so so helpful though :heart:
for decoding yes, but all thats doing is pulling to the surface bugs that would be in your javascript code
how would your javascript respond if the data didn't match
