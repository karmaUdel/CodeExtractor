U6CDYTP5W : You're right.  I shouldve just asked how to do it, at first. I still want to learn how to use regex tho :stuck_out_tongue:
U6CDYTP5W : Oh well, hopefully another time. Thanks, again!
U1BP42MRS : If you want to do the regex way you'd do something similar, you'd use a "capture group", convert them to floats, then compare. Much more involved and harder to maintain :smile:
U1BP42MRS : it probably still requires listing the dir too
U4ANSK0N9 : Hi All, I am trying to get apache running on webserver for django application. When trying to query it i am getting 301 and 405 response
U4ANSK0N9 : anything that i am missing?
U1BP42MRS : What's the location header of the `301`?
U1BP42MRS : You can check with `curl -i &lt;path&gt;` if you are unfamiliar
U4ANSK0N9 : <@U1BP42MRS> i am very new to this. what is value to use in &lt;path&gt;
U1BP42MRS : The path is the url:  `curl -i localhost:8000/admin`, for example
U1BP42MRS : As an example, see this request:
```
$ curl -i <https://google.com>
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: <https://www.google.com/>
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

```

The `Location` one may tell you the issue, my guess is you are not including a trailing slash

U4ANSK0N9 : let me check
U1BP42MRS : Sorry, I am also assuming you have `curl` installed, if your OS doesn't have it you can test in a browser and use the inspector to see
U4ANSK0N9 : spot on. I was able to get rid of that issue. Now i have 500 error which i will try to figure out. 
Thank you very much. :+1:

U4ANSK0N9 : will keep you posted on my progress :slightly_smiling_face:
U1BP42MRS : :thumbsup::skin-tone-4:
U5CGPBF0U : `UPDATE stores SET geom = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326);`vs.
`UPDATE yourtable SET geom = ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude);`
What's le difference?

U4ANSK0N9 : It worked fine. I ran into some permission issue but it is now resolved. Thank you for all the nelp
U2AQ9D8US : <@U5CGPBF0U> the first example sets an SRID of 4386 (WGS84).  the second example doesn't set an SRID and should get the default for geometry which is 0
U5CGPBF0U : <@U2AQ9D8US> Will that cause a big difference in the resulting values?
U2AQ9D8US : Depends what your doing.  When SRID is 0, the data gets treated like it's on a Cartesian plane (flat).  Using 4326 allows for a round earth.  If you're trying to do things like get the distance between two points, it can make a difference.
U5CGPBF0U : <@U2AQ9D8US> That was the best explanation I could have hoped for. I'd looked it up before but none of the explanations made as much sense as what you said right now. Haha
U5CGPBF0U : I'm trying to find all points inside a square
U5CGPBF0U : I also see that PostGIS says on the site `DO NOT INSTALL it in the database called postgres.`... That's exactly what I did though... No idea why they say not to do it
U0LSCQQNR : You have to install it to your database 
U0LSCQQNR : Eg, the one you created for the project 
U0LSCQQNR : If you're familiar with mysql, the postgres db name is similar to the mysql db name
U5CGPBF0U : <@U0LSCQQNR> Ah ok. Got it.
U5CGPBF0U : People keep telling me that `43.6532, 79.3832` leads to somewhere in Kazakhstan. I don't understand. They're the coordinates of TORONTO. Put them into Google Maps and it drops a pin in the center of Toronto.
U29163YQH : it drop me in kazakhstan
U29163YQH : `43.6532, -79.3832` is Toronto
U5CGPBF0U : <https://www.google.ca/search?q=toronto+lat+long&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=awZ3WbaYOYTHjwSQlIuwCw>
U5CGPBF0U : I don't get it.
U5CGPBF0U : These "coordinates" Google is serving me aren't actually lat/lon
U5CGPBF0U : ?
U29163YQH : 79.3832° *W*
U29163YQH : without direction it's EAST by default
U5CGPBF0U : :facepalm:
U5CGPBF0U : Wow. Two days of development time spent on trying to figure that out.
U5CGPBF0U : Thank you <@U29163YQH>. May the force be with you.
U5CGPBF0U : Will be fun to explain to my boss. : o )
U29163YQH : good luck :smile:
U29163YQH : try with a compas that point south maybe it will help
U5CGPBF0U : So, rather than using the default `postgres` database I made a new one for testing and ran `CREATE EXTENSION postgis;` in it. However when running a query with a spatial function I get `ERROR:  function st_dwithin(geography, geography) does not exist`. This doesn't happen in the `postgres` database. :thinking_face:
U5CGPBF0U : Read that `SET search_path TO public, sml;` should fix it, but no luck
U5CGPBF0U : postgis is definitely in the `public` schema
U5LNXQHN3 : <@U5CGPBF0U> Might be a question for <#C3X4T24LB|databases>
U0N6ZV5AN : Hello Pythonistas,anyone would know why `mimetypes.guess_type('my_file.csv')` returns `('application/vns.ms-excel', None)` instead of `('text/csv', None)` like Linux does? The file does not even exist.

U29163YQH : Maybe because the default software for it is `excel` and windows do some tricks
U29163YQH : is it doing the same with an existing file ?
U5LNXQHN3 : Looks like it uses registry settings, and doesn't examine actual files, just filenames
U0N6ZV5AN : Yeah, with an existing file the result is the same.
U0N6ZV5AN : Looks indeed as registry settings. I thought that `mimetypes` was supposed to be os-independent... I guess I am wrong? I just assumed it that way.
U13L8J76J : <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/mimetypes.py#L350-L351>
U13L8J76J : It's os-dependent :slightly_smiling_face: Like anything that windows touches
U5LNXQHN3 : What type a file 'is' can always be open to interpretation, unfortunately
U0LSCQQNR : <@U5CGPBF0U> with alot of these postgis questions yo have, there should be answers on <https://gis.stackexchange.com/>
U5CGPBF0U : <@U0LSCQQNR> Oh, yes, I check there and other places, but the supposed solution to the problem doesn't work for me. :disappointed:
U0LSCQQNR : oh, interesting
U0LSCQQNR : are you using 9.6 postgres?
U0LSCQQNR : and the latest postgis?
U0LSCQQNR : I've never encountered your issue
U5CGPBF0U : Yes, and yes. :slightly_smiling_face:
U5CGPBF0U : I run `SET search_path TO public, sml;` which is generally the solution presented but I still receive the same error.
U5CGPBF0U : I don't, however, receive this error when running queries on the default `postgres` database. Only on this new one.
U5CGPBF0U : And I've confirmed that postgis is on the public schema as well
U0LSCQQNR : so, if you use something like pgadmin
U0LSCQQNR : and open up the tree down to your new database
U0LSCQQNR : so postgis is in your db extensions?
U0LSCQQNR : also, what is your query you're running
U0LSCQQNR : usually when you get this issue with postgis, it means you're inputing invalid types in the function
U5CGPBF0U : Yes, it's listed in the extensions for the new database.
U5CGPBF0U : Um...
U5CGPBF0U : So I rebooted my PC for unrelated reasons and now it works.
U5CGPBF0U : Interesting
U29163YQH : postgres might need a restart when you install postgis
U0LSCQQNR : especially on windows
U0LSCQQNR : because you can't update certain files when the system is running
U0LSCQQNR : so you ether need to restart the service or reboot
U5LNXQHN3 : Yep - on Windows open up Task Manager, pick Services, find postgres whatever, right click, Restart
U5CGPBF0U : Wow. Seems like one of those "did you try turning it off and back on again?" moments. :facepalm:
U5CGPBF0U : Haha, thanks for clarifying that though!
U5JF1KD18 : Hello guys I'm trying to implement a proxy server in the form of a python script it presents itself like this
U5JF1KD18 : I want to operate 4 basic steps
U5JF1KD18 : 1- Listen from the web browser
U5JF1KD18 : 2- Forward the request to the web server
U5JF1KD18 : 3- Get the response from the web server
U5JF1KD18 : 4- Send back the server response to the browser
U5JF1KD18 : My main problem is first at step 2. This is because at a certain point, i want to rewrite the URL from the browser and I don't know how to do that and I'm just a beginner
U5LNXQHN3 : There are existing proxies that can rewrite URLs. You don't need to write any software to do it.
U5JF1KD18 : Oh... I didn't knew that. Can you please give me an example of one ?
U5LNXQHN3 : <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html>
U0LSCQQNR : and if you're using nginx
U0LSCQQNR : <http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html>
U5JF1KD18 : OK i'll try it thanks guys
U5NMSURAQ : <@U5LNXQHN3> Apache in 2017?
U5LNXQHN3 : Sure, go old school 
U5LNXQHN3 : Nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM
U5LNXQHN3 : ... etc
U5NMSURAQ : don't forget mod_perl
U5LNXQHN3 : nah, straight to CGI, none of this crazy new tech
U5LNXQHN3 : I would start by moving it all into one function, which gets called once. Then I'd move parts of it into various individual functions based on grouping lumps of shared functionality together. For example, each block of logic in a for loop is a candidate for a function because it's related code that gets called on a succession of data
U5LNXQHN3 : I'd also consider ditching things like `range(len(target_column_G))` which is usually the wrong way to iterate over something in Python
U4A56U70C : <@U5LNXQHN3> Thank you, I read about functions except I never really implemented one, any dummy proof example on this snippet how can I have them in a function?
U5LNXQHN3 : I think it's perhaps too fundamental a concept to explain in chat. Maybe a tutorial will help, e.g. <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm>
U4A56U70C : Thank you, reading it
U4A56U70C : What would you suggest, to continue working on getting new features and bigger code, or to prioritize implementing functions to clean it up?
U0LSCQQNR : I'd priotize learning good design and structure
U0LSCQQNR : because once you are able to structure a program effectively, adding new features and maintaining older code is much easier
U4A56U70C : Thank you
U4A56U70C : <@U0LSCQQNR> Do you have any other notes other tha what <@U5LNXQHN3>  mentioned?
U0LSCQQNR : he covered everything, I think
U0LSCQQNR : and i'd use some blank lines for separation
U0LSCQQNR : for bits that really don't belong in a different function
U0LSCQQNR : group variables together by general area of responsibility
U5LNXQHN3 : The problem with learning the right way to write programs is that a lot of it doesn't make much sense until you've gone through the process a few times
U5LNXQHN3 : I'd say just start small, clean things up, write functions, then maybe write classes, and read through the Python tutorial to understand all the tools available to you
U4A56U70C : So <@U5LNXQHN3> I should continue developing this and learning other simple functions then when confident enough I release another version with functions?
U5LNXQHN3 : I don't know - what is your end goal here?
U4BMZ90T0 : Having an issue with instantiation of a new object within another one as an attribute. I have two classes as such `class a` and `class b`
U4BMZ90T0 : in class a under `__init__` I do `self.obj = b()`
U4BMZ90T0 : and I attempt to run a function from `class b` via the `obj` variable through `self.obj.run_func()` within `class a`
U4BMZ90T0 : I think a line got deleted that I typed, can't quite tell...
U4BMZ90T0 : But either way, `class b` isn't really a child as much as it's just an attribute of the `class a` but attempting to run a function within `class a` on the `obj` variable gives a reference error
U5LNXQHN3 : show the actual error
U4BMZ90T0 : `Unresolved attribute reference to run_func in object b`
U4BMZ90T0 : But the function is in the class
U5NMSURAQ : but is it?
U5LNXQHN3 : Does it _actually_ say "in object b"
U4BMZ90T0 : `in class b` the edits I am making keep deleting the whole lines
U5LNXQHN3 : classes aren't objects, so these details are critical
U5LNXQHN3 : In your definition of `class b`, is there a method `run_func`?
U4BMZ90T0 : yes
U4BMZ90T0 : But I'm also getting scope errors for self
U5LNXQHN3 : "scope errors"
U4BMZ90T0 : shadow name self
U5NMSURAQ : &gt; classes aren't objectssay what

U5LNXQHN3 : <@U5NMSURAQ> You'll confuse things...
U5NMSURAQ : &gt; shadow name selfhere you go :slightly_smiling_face:

U4BMZ90T0 : yeah, but I don't understand exactly where it's coming from?
U4BMZ90T0 : Is it the import into the other module?
U4A56U70C : <@U5LNXQHN3> I am writing a software which is used by few customers now, it does the job now, but I am looking to both better myself and my code that's all, so seeking advice if in your opinion I should let it stay the same for now till I learn more or continue working on adding more then later enhance.
U5LNXQHN3 : errors typically tell you exactly where they come from, with a line number
U4BMZ90T0 : Ah shiet
U4BMZ90T0 : Got it, bad indent into init
U5LNXQHN3 : <@U4A56U70C> For your personal development you should read more about the language and practice with it, improving your code as you go
U4A56U70C : Got it thank you
U0LSCQQNR : <https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Python-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0134034287/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1500992243&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=effective+python>
U0LSCQQNR : is a great resource
U4A56U70C : <@U0LSCQQNR> Thank you, I get bored from intros though, because as you saw I can write some code that works but not happy with the quality.
U4A56U70C : But I see it doesn't have intros and it's spot on to functions
U0LSCQQNR : correct
U0LSCQQNR : it gives you an item of specific consideration
U0LSCQQNR : and does a good evaluation throughout
U5LNXQHN3 : There's not really any good way to get good at programming without starting at the beginning and making sure you understand the fundamental building blocks: control flow statements, functions, variables and objects, types, structures and classes, etc
U0LSCQQNR : I'm assuming <@U4A56U70C> has some experience with that
U5LNXQHN3 : Above: _" I read about functions except I never really implemented one"_
U0LSCQQNR : oh
U4A56U70C : Yes true, I read and I know the fundamentals but to add two numbers and such
U0LSCQQNR : missed that, been in and out
U5LNXQHN3 : writing a function (along with creating your own classes) are part of the fundamentals
U0LSCQQNR : fluent python might be better
U0LSCQQNR : <https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1500992603&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fluent+python>
U4A56U70C : So I think back to the code I should implement a `re.finder` Function and pass the patterns later on
U5LNXQHN3 : No... you wouldn't be adding a `finder` function to `re`
U5LNXQHN3 : But you could write a function that does contain all the 'finding', if you liked
U4A56U70C : Ah huh
U4A56U70C : One function that has all the finding with all the patterns
U4A56U70C : And when writing I call the right one?
U5LNXQHN3 : I don't know what you mean by that. The alternative would be to call the wrong one...
U4A56U70C : The function would have the `re.findall` with all the patterns, and when writing to the csv I call one from what I define at the top
U4A56U70C : Best to shut up and go read, thank you both
U4BMZ90T0 : Good for getting date input?
U5LNXQHN3 : It looks like it would work
U4BMZ90T0 : Is `ConfigParser` a pretty good tool for setting up constants
U4BMZ90T0 : About to get started with it
U5LNXQHN3 : You don't really need it if you're not distributing or deploying your software, but for managing configuration constants, sure, it works
U4BMZ90T0 : I've just got a global constant `.py` file with values, but I also need to be able to set global constants based on user input. They're being set in a class so I suppose I could always just pass the class object around and grab values that way, but I'm sort of looking for something a bit nicer
U5LNXQHN3 : if it's user input then configparser is the wrong tool
U47HK8BS8 : generally what I do these days is a combination of environment variables and Click for the CLI
U0NRYQNAZ : :thumbsup: for click.
U47HK8BS8 : loading from a .env file as well if people want to have stuff in there
U0NRYQNAZ : i like having a .env.example file
U3EEX4N78 : ^ Always helps clear up so many questions for most people
U47HK8BS8 : and if it's something like a flask app, I'll usually tie it all together in a `config.py`
U5S8CNULD : Hey guys,  using `sqlalchemy`I have field `created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)`
and I confused, How I can get data by datetime. For example, I need get data for current day.
and I did something like this.
```
 db.session.query(Post).join(User). \
            filter(Post.user_id == user_id). \
            filter(Post.user_type == 'eng').\
            filter(Post.created_at == get_today())
```

```
def get_today():
    return datetime.now()
```
But the example didn't work(

U0LSCQQNR : are you getting None or something?
U5S8CNULD : just empty array
U1BP42MRS : Right now you are filtering based on this exact moment
U1BP42MRS : so that understandably won't work
U5S8CNULD : but in the database I have record with current day.
U0LSCQQNR : day, yes
U0LSCQQNR : but not the current minute, second, hour of the request
U1BP42MRS : `datetime.now()` against a timefield will be date/time
U1BP42MRS : `date.now()` may work
