U3BTVEFQU : it wasn't me!! :wink:
U2JA29EKF : Sorry, won't be able to look tonight.

U23SA861Y : umm, request isn't defined....
U3BTVEFQU : <@U3SJEDR96> ok this does work. However I still don't get it.. do you know any good introduction into cmds vs tasks?
U0F7JPK36 : jonf: something weird happened with aws. looks okay now
U3SJEDR96 : In <@U3BTVEFQU>'s code, it is :wink:
U3BTVEFQU : Btw <@U3SJEDR96> thx!!! :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : Though this probably makes more sense:
U3SJEDR96 : ```sendDelayedRequest : Time.Time -&gt; Http.Request a -&gt; (WebData a -&gt; msg) -&gt; Cmd msg
sendDelayedRequest delay request tagger =
    Process.sleep delay
        |&gt; Task.andThen (\_ -&gt; Http.toTask request)
        |&gt; RemoteData.fromTask
        |&gt; Task.perform tagger
```

U3BTVEFQU : <@U2JA29EKF> no problemo, <@U3SJEDR96> fixed it for me.. However I'm still on the task to understand it properly :wink:

U5W50TZ6C : I have a question about records:Lets say I have a function that takes a record, like this:
```
getId : { file | id : String } -&gt; String
getId file =
    file.id
```
I could pass in something like this: `{ id = "abcd", name = "hi.txt"}` because it's got an `id`. All good so far.

My question is: could I create an alias for the "file" in the function type signature? What would the syntax for that be?

U0J8D9M2P : Yes you can
U0J8D9M2P : It's called extensible record
U0J8D9M2P : You can create a type alias for that
U0J8D9M2P : type alias File file = { file | id : String }
U0LPMPL2U : you can alias anything that would go in a function signature
U0LPMPL2U : even functions e.g. `type alias Function a b  = (a -&gt; b)`
U5W50TZ6C : Awesome, thank you <@U0J8D9M2P>, that's the word I was looking for
U5W50TZ6C : Wow, good to know <@U0LPMPL2U> !
U2DSBB76Y : Is it possible to click on a button which expands out an input, and give that input focus?
