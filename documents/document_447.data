U2SR9DL7Q : <@U2U94G0QG> i just wanted to know if anyone had tried it, and if they were successful. I've done desktop apps before using python but since moving into web dev with elm, I thought would make sense to just be consistent about my UI design across platforms. I'd heard some folk poo-poo-ing electron for app size and performance, so I wanted to hear from someone who actually used it.
U2U94G0QG : Well, my projects with Elm/Electron aren't production scale/quality and I never made a prod build of any of them - but we just released a React/Redux/Electron app and I feel pretty good about it
U2SR9DL7Q : sounds good
U2U94G0QG : I found this to be useful <https://github.com/johnomarkid/elm-electron-webpack>
U2U94G0QG : for getting started
U2U94G0QG : It's not a boilerplate
U2SR9DL7Q : this is awesome
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U2U94G0QG> thanks!
U2U94G0QG : yvw
U5ABF3BH7 : Hi!  I am writing a Json.Encode function to create an object in the back end, in my database.  I have a Kase. ```type alias kase =  { name : String, organization : Maybe Organization.Model, ...} ```. The field organization is a Maybe.  If there is no organization entered, I don't want that field passed in my Json object.  as it will give me some validation errors. How can I do that?  I can only think of doing List.append. This is how the code looks like if an organization exists
U5ABF3BH7 : ```Json.object   [ ("name" , Json.string model.name)
   , ( "organization_attributes", Json.string model.organization)
]```

U5ABF3BH7 : any advice
U5ABF3BH7 : ?
U5ABF3BH7 : but if there is not organization, I only want
U5ABF3BH7 : ```Json.object   [ ("name" , Json.string model.name)]```

U5ABF3BH7 : (this is a simplified version)
U3DQT3ZGC : Hi All! Is there a way to detect if an image is loaded in Elm like this? ```const tempImage = new Image(500, 500);tempImage.addEventListener('load', doSomething);

tempImage.src = url;
```

U0K92QFST : <@U3DQT3ZGC> Elm allows you to define custom event handlers for any HTML tag: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-html/4.0.0/Html-Events#on>
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U5ABF3BH7> There are a few ways of doing it. One might be:```
Json.object (List.filterMap identity [Just ("name", Json.String model.name), Maybe.map (\org -&gt; ("organization_attributes", Json.String org))])
```

U0K92QFST : <@U5ABF3BH7> <@U48AEBJQ3> here's what I came up with:```
let 
  nameField = ("name", Json.string model.name)
in
  case model.organization of
    Just org -&gt;
      nameField :: [("organization_attributes", Json.string org)]
    Nothing -&gt;
      [nameField]
```

U48AEBJQ3 : And there is another :simple_smile:.
U0FP80EKB : This```
 nameField :: [("organization_attributes", Json.string org)]```
can just be
```
 [nameField, ("organization_attributes", Json.string org)]
```

U3DQT3ZGC : So this this should work ? `Html.img [ on "load" (Json.succeed message), src "image.jpg" ] []`
U5ABF3BH7 : <@U48AEBJQ3> <@U0K92QFST>  <@U0FP80EKB>  Thanks a lot!
