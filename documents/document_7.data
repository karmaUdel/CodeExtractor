U0YJJPFRA : Hello all, how can I use something like this:```'([:command "upper"] [:command "reverse"] [:command "remove-vogal"]) ;; this is the commands that I have to apply to collection
I thougth doing defmulti like: 
(defmulti command (fn [[_ command] _] command))
(defmethod command "upper" [command string] (upper string)) ...
["string nubmer 1" "string nubmer 2" "string nubmer 3"] ;; is the collection
```
and I want to have the results in the end. I coudn´t figure out how to do this with threading macro, Is there possible?

U054UD60U : The defmulti and defmethod look ok. And threading is possible in general. Maybe you can past an example invokation?
U0YJJPFRA : well, that´s the problem how to apply the rules to collection and get the result : `["1 RBMN GNRTS" ... ]`
U0YJJPFRA : `(reduce #(conj %1 (command %2 collection) [] '([:command "upper"] [:command "reverse"] [:command "remove-vogal"]))`?
U0YJJPFRA : I think this doesn´t pass the result to another, correct?
U3MLRD13K : <@U0YJJPFRA> It sounds like you want a `reduce` over the seq of commands. seq of strings is the initial value; each pass maps command over the seq of strings
U0YJJPFRA : In this case I´m runing each command to a collection
U0YJJPFRA : my needs is run all command to each element
U0YJJPFRA : how can I use dynamic transform for each element? something like `(-&gt; element (commands ?))`
U3MLRD13K : That is what a `reduce` would do, if I understand you correctly
U3MLRD13K : ```(reduce 
  #(map
      (command %1)
      %2)
   [seq-of-commands]
   [seq-of-string])
```

U3MLRD13K : Only I think I got the order of the args passed to the reducer wrong
U3MLRD13K : Also I am not sure the dispatch syntax is correct, but that's the basic idea
U3MLRD13K : Whoa that's actually what you wrote above and I guess I wasn't paying close enough attention.
U3MLRD13K : <@U0YJJPFRA> What didn't work about the snippet you sent earlier?
U0YJJPFRA : <@U3MLRD13K> I think you trick is correct, I´ll give a try, thank you
U28TJ0DDZ : hey guys, I'm looking forward to design an extensible library. but I'm not sure which is the best approach to it, do you know any reading matterial about this ?
U1CTH1TUY : What's the library's purpose?
U28TJ0DDZ : a web framework
U2APCNHCN : *hides behind corner* Frameworks are evil.
U28TJ0DDZ : <@U2APCNHCN> what do you mean ?
U236LQYB0 : <@U28TJ0DDZ> if you haven't already, you should give lispcast's recent article series on clojure webframeworks a read: <http://www.lispcast.com/why-web-frameworks> , <http://www.lispcast.com/arguments-against-frameworks> , &amp; <http://www.lispcast.com/clojure-web-framework>
U1LCB75M2 : <@U28TJ0DDZ> best library possible is a bunch of little functions that compose correctly (e.g. a domain-specific algebra)
U28TJ0DDZ : <@U236LQYB0> thanks, I'll watch them
U28TJ0DDZ : <@U1LCB75M2> thanks
U1LCB75M2 : maybe one practical example is something like XPath vs. Lenses for traversing data structures
U1LCB75M2 : if you design w/ XPath in mind, the API will look one way, w/ Lenses probably another
U1LCB75M2 : and will compose differently
U1LCB75M2 : (or not at all)
U28TJ0DDZ : <@U236LQYB0> are you the author ?
U236LQYB0 : I am not
U28TJ0DDZ : it's a good material, but i'm not agree with some of those ideas
U064X3EF3 : If one thing is clear, it's that we have both too many and not enough frameworks
U28TJ0DDZ : <@U064X3EF3> yeah that's true, At the end of the day frameworks are just tools, there are lots of good and bad tools around
U28TJ0DDZ : I don't think that not using a framework makes you an expert. It might makes you a fool because your trying to go to a war with a water pistol
U0HM5MJ5V : my experience with frameworks is that you trade potentially getting boxed in by constraints later for a quicker start on a project
U0LGCREMU : define "framework".  to me, something that works, until it doesn't.  massive pain ensues.
U0HM5MJ5V : good trade if the project doesn't grow and change i guess
U0HM5MJ5V : yeah seems like there's a list of qualifications to me
U0HM5MJ5V : big one is the framework code implements your -main and controls initialization and lifecycle stuff
U0HM5MJ5V : (imho)
U0HM5MJ5V : maybe baked in libraries for handling each task (data mapping, routing, caching, rendering, etc) that're hard to change out would be another
U0LGCREMU : fwiw, when i hear "framework", i think monolithic, non-compositional blob-o-stuff.
U0HM5MJ5V : yeah. more up front pain to compose/integrate a bunch of single purpose libraries but tends to pay off
U0LGCREMU : composing libs (components) - way better, in general. problem tends to be docs.
U0LGCREMU : you can't be expected to doc every possible use of your lib.
U0JMKBZL0 : I've run into a strange compiler error that only seems to manifest when I pull in a secondary library via checkouts. I've verified the problem is not code as it works on another machine. Tried reinstalling java and Leiningen to no avail. Any idea what this could be?
U0JMKBZL0 : ```user=&gt; (require '[foo.bar])
CompilerException java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError, compiling:(foo.bar.clj:1:1)```

U0JMKBZL0 : If I remove the symlink in checkouts, everything seems to work fine.
U064X3EF3 : frameworks are things that call you, rather than things you call
U064X3EF3 : (which are more likely components)
U064X3EF3 : <@U0LGCREMU> ^^
U0LGCREMU : hmm, seems a reasonable defn
U064X3EF3 : not something I made up and probably not 100% satisfying, but I think it's about right
U0NBGRGD6 : <https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/DEPLOY.md>I'm trying to deploy to private repo according to this tut, but every time I use lein deploy, It will ask for username and password. 
I mentioned it's said there's a bug for gpg, it that mean the username and password in credentials.clj.gpg will not work, orI have to do something?

U0S3YK6HK : Hey all, I am running into what I think is a bug with how clojure's java interop works
U0S3YK6HK : I am trying to wrap <https://github.com/lokra/seaweedfs-client> for use in clojure
