Hey guys, I was just testing my bot and noticed that there's only one URL to post to for slash commands - what has everyone been doing in terms of testing?
I guess I could have it pointed to a server to redirect traffic, and have it go to the server based on channel name/team name. That seems awkward
<@U04S0AG48>:  thanks!
I test my service in isolation.
<@U0HUTFBHS>: do you mean to setup a second app?
Well, a slash command sends a request to a service- so I test that service code with a fixture of what I expect from slack.
I see.. what I understand is that there's a single URL to post to, which means that I can't switch from production to a private fixture (like local tunnel) without breaking production
Oh I see what you're saying.  Yes, that's true.
Or add a secondary command like /command-beta
Yeah we run separate apps/slash commands for each env
But my isolated testing of the service ensures a bit that I'm going to get what I expect out of it.
got it that helps, thanks guys
