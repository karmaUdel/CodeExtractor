I couldn't find a good tutorial that explains this so I sort of followed the cats git example
but couldn't get far
<@U4RR7KX45> What is in the list?
at the moment I'm just hard coding it on the api
and it's just an array of strings
`Decode.list : Decoder a -&gt; Decoder (List a)` So you need to hand it a decoder for each item in the list and it will apply it across the whole list.
