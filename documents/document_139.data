It's surprising in my opinion actually. Maybe it's a bug in the lib, not wrapping with `(name symbol)` where it should.
Nope, I'm wrong
it's surprising but I dunno about bug... the language reader and the data format reader can't be exactly the same
That's probably it. I'll check when I get back to my computer. 
Yep removing the quote fixed it. Thanks for your help!
So I have some code in my -main function `(extend-classpath (filter #(.contains (.getName %) ".jar") (file-seq plugin-dir)))`. If I run this directly in the repl, it changes my classpath as I want it to. If I run the -main function in the repl, it doesn't work. What causes this difference (boot repl if it matters)?
Oh, thanks! But I'm afraid I already have an invite. Thank you anyway.
<@U1C03090C> regarding `extend-class` in repl vs -main, I'm wondering if it could be related to boot using pods to isolate classpath (<https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Boot-for-Leiningen-Users#repl-dependencies>). Just getting started with boot myself. Would appreciate an authoritative answer too.
There seems to be an issue with 1.9.0-alpha17 in let blocks with auto-gensymed variables in macros. Is that a known issue?
<@U0DH86UA1> could you elaborate?
<@U0DJC1V3R> I'm trying to find the example that exploded yesterday :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U0DJC1V3R> looking again with fresh eyes, I found the bug. I had this:
that fails with something completely unreadable:
trying it in 1.8 I am getting this instead:
that error message seems crystal clear to me /s
so if I do the right thing and use `msg#` instead of `msg` it works
So yeah. Not a bug, just a mistake on my part, coupled with an awful error message :confused:
If this is a `loop/recur` – is there any intuition for how to know how many things I need to keep track of in `loop` bindings? I seem to spend much more time on these than it should take me.
<@U0DJC1V3R> i just added this: <https://github.com/bhb/expound/blob/master/README.md>
and got this:
that's pretty neat...
that's indeed pretty cool!
