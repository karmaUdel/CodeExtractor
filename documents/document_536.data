Ah I see this is a reactor issue, nvm, I came in late :sweat:
Note that I am doing `elm-make Main.elm --output elm.js`
Oh, you should run `elm-reactor` and then go to <http://localhost:8000/index.html>
<@U0CLDU8UB>  That gives me a totally blank page
we use it at NRI via ports
Actually I can run my original index.html (no taco) via reactor and app comes up fine (at <http://localhost:8000/index.html>) -- I just don't see the state of the model anywhere.
do you see a little "history" thing in the bottom right?
A black "tab" of sorts
nope
Wait a moment
you compile with `elm-make Main.elm` right?
did you checked the output file? Sometimes i use an `old output file` without realizing -&gt; (from a previous run of elm make in another directory for ex).
the index.html file you're using for the taco stuff, does it refer to `/_compile/src/Main.elm` or `/_compile/Main.elm`?
`&lt;script src="/_compile/src/Main.elm"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`
right, so what basically happens is it's trying to find a `src/Main.elm` but (judging by your compile command) your `Main.elm` is in the same directory as your `elm-package.json`
so adapting that to simply `/_compile/Main.elm` should help a bunch
I still do not see the hoped-for widgetry
Do you see your app at all, <@U5FU80S06>
please show us the relevant directory structure you have: the parent of the `elm-package.json` - and the path to `Main.elm`
i think you have
  // Main.elm
no src?
