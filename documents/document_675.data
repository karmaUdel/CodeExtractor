U3R7CKQRX : i think you can only compute that percentage by doing `tableScrollTop / tableheight`
U23SA861Y : what value does the scroll event get you?
U5LFUHH19 : I'm working through the <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example>.  My site can been seen here: <http://test.hurwitzlab.org/#/>, and the code is here: <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example>.  I have only implemented the "Browse -&gt; Investigators" successfully.  When I click on an investigator to get to the "/investigator/&lt;id&gt;", I get lost on how to pass the ID (an int) into the model and so forth.  I'm hoping someone can look at my code and see the problems.
U5LFUHH19 : Here is the error I get: <https://gist.github.com/kyclark/6b16685d633102611d299c5eaf2716c6>
U285A8S8H : I guess I can't put an if statement where value is expected when calling a function? like so```
div [ containerStyle ]
  if foo then
    [ text "Foo" ]
  else
    [ text "Bar" ]
```
so  now the question is - `let..in` or a new function? :wink:

U5LFUHH19 : `div [ style ] [ text (if foo then "Foo" else "Bar") ]` ?
U285A8S8H : I guess that could work, but there's more html than a simple text - I settled on a let-in
U285A8S8H : ahh cosmetic stuff, the bane of every dev's existence :+1:
U0M9CNX1A : Case by case basis when this is appropriate, but you can also wrap the `if` expression in parens```
div [ containerStyle ]
    (if foo then
        [ text "Foo" ]
     else
        [ text "Bar" ]
    )
```

U0J1M0F32 : I prefer the `let` `in` approach, *or* I'll usually use that opportunity to pull out a helper view function.
U0JFXEUCT : you can also do```
test2 =
    div [] &lt;|
        if True then
            [ text "Foo" ]
        else
            [ text "Bar" ]
```

U0JFXEUCT : not that thats a good idea or anything…
U1432C733 : Hi all. My colleagues and I did a bit of searching on this and couldn't quite come up with something we liked. We have an Elm app that is basically just a left bar app to select "sub apps"
U1432C733 : Right now, we compile all of them into one project with the left bar as the parent.
U1432C733 : The trouble is, it's becoming a little tightly coupled and hard to deal with as we keep developing more sub apps. Additionally, complexity has been introduced where each user now needs a different list of sub apps.
U1432C733 : The the question is: is it a totally awful (high bar, I know) idea to have a parent app expose a div and on a button click, get a new static (the compiled sub app) to attach to that div?
U1432C733 : *awaits tomatoes*
U0J1M0F32 : What you're asking is technically possible, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it from a design perspective.
U0J1M0F32 : Also, no one will throw tomatoes at you :yellow_heart:
U1432C733 : That was our feeling as well. We knew it _could be done_ but surely there must be smarter people than us who have already done it better.
U0J1M0F32 : I think, I personally, would need a little more background on the project and the business/technical constraints at play before I could give a fair assessment. Others here in chat may be more useful.
U0J1M0F32 : I'll follow along with the convo and pipe in if I think of anything.
U1432C733 : Cool. What would be helpful?
U0JFXEUCT : There are two talks coming out from the elm europe that deal directly with scaling elm code
U0JFXEUCT : they’re both really good
U0JFXEUCT : one by evan, another by richard feldman
U0J1M0F32 : Elm Europe 2017 -&gt; <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT5HLUjjXdqUSUnpblFNOwQ>
U0JFXEUCT : I know that’s not directly answering your question :slightly_smiling_face:
U0JFXEUCT : also, you might want to check out richard’s SPA example
U0JFXEUCT : <https://dev.to/rtfeldman/tour-of-an-open-source-elm-spa>
U0JFXEUCT : right, so you have one parent model-view-update triplet that redirects to children which each have their model-view-update triplet?
U1432C733 : My ms paint skills at their finest :smile:
U1432C733 : Correct
U0JFXEUCT : (exquisite artistry!)
U0JFXEUCT : So, the general advice I’ve heard and that I follow is that that’s a hard pattern to pursue
U0JFXEUCT : again evan and richard talk about it better than I can.  But the question you should ask is do you actually need that?  Or can you just grow a single app normally and break an individual part into functions when it gets “too big”
U285A8S8H : how can I run a batch of two commands to somehow receive two values?
U285A8S8H : perhaps I'm thinking this wrong - I need to get current time and a random number
U1432C733 : For sure. We're doing that now. It's just getting a little busy across our team.
U285A8S8H : so I wrote a msg type that takes a Time and an Int
U1432C733 : Plus the coupling is a little tighter and we wanted to see if there was a looser way to do it.
U1432C733 : Basically, we have a distributed group of people developing applications to be nested in our "upside down L" app.
U0JFXEUCT : do these apps truly function separately?  the elm compiler makes it easier to have people all working on one codebase
U1432C733 : <@U285A8S8H> Look into msg.batch
U1432C733 : <@U0JFXEUCT> Yes, the apps are totally disconnected from one another.
U285A8S8H : I think I could use Task.map2 there
U1432C733 : <@U285A8S8H> Sorry, Cmd.batch
U0JFXEUCT : <@U1432C733>  I have to head out unfortunately, though hopefully someone else will chime in. :smile:  I wish you luck and again recommend the talks by evan and richard on this…hopefully they’ll be posted soon.
U1432C733 : <@U0JFXEUCT> Thank you so much. We'll watch that now. We very much appreciate the help.
U285A8S8H : I think my problem is that I need to get a Task for generating the random number, but I don't see any function like that in the Random module
U285A8S8H : I would then do `Task.map2 task1 task2 MyMsg`
U285A8S8H : Ok let's not do that, I'll use two msg types
U1432C733 : <@U285A8S8H> can you explain from start to finish what you are trying to do? I'm not quite understanding it.
U285A8S8H : Ok, so I'm writing an app for practicing musical scales etc. When the user clicks "start", a random exercise is generated and a timer shows up
U285A8S8H : I thought that I'd prepare a cmd that gets current time, generates a random exercise and feeds the data into a single StartExercise msg
U1432C733 : I see.
U285A8S8H : I tried to use Task.map2 for that, but generating a random number doesn't provide a task, it provides a Cmd instantly
U1432C733 : Cool. So here's a way to do it (and likely the way I'd start with).
U285A8S8H : so now I decided to use two msgs
U1432C733 : I would say, create an update and Msg for: 1. get the random number and 2. start the clock. Then on that button click, Cmd.Batch those two messages, or, if they are sequenced, call the random number and on update, call the start clock.
U1432C733 : I asked my colleague and he suggested checking out Task.andThen as well.
U1432C733 : <@U285A8S8H> Was that helpful?
U285A8S8H : yeah, I'm gonna use two msgs
U285A8S8H : thanks
U285A8S8H : Task.andThen won't help because I have a Generator for the exercise
U285A8S8H : I looked in the docs for Random module and there's no function to get a Task from a Generator
U1432C733 : He just stepped out. I would handle it the same way you are: just batch ( Random.generate &lt;&lt;generator&gt;&gt;) and (Task.perform NewTime Time.now)
U285A8S8H : :+1:
U285A8S8H : FWIW I implemented a Pause feature that stops the timer  and resumes it after resuming (duh)
U285A8S8H : that caused a need for refactor and now I don't need two msgs at all, I can rely solely on my `Time.every` sub
U285A8S8H : :tada:
U1432C733 : Nice :+1:
U2LAL86AY : and for the breaking fold stuff check out this code by ilias : <https://ellie-app.com/3Cxhjfm6Qrga1/1>
U2LAL86AY : need to go, good luck :smile:
U3YDBDP4Z : Just got my first Mac, and I'm downloading elm-format but I'm not familiar with Macs so I'm not sure where elm-format should live?
U3YDBDP4Z : Also using Atom, so the elm-format plugin needs to find elm-format
U61V125H6 : Hey, is anyone here working on an Elm in-browser editor or WYSIWYG. Something similar to [stackedit](<https://stackedit.io/editor>). I'm aware of [Dreamwriter](<https://dreamwriter.co/>), but I found simplifying and taking out sections a little tricky. If possible, more of a WYSIWYG library that you can integrate into your elm code
U2M17S85D : Why does the `List` package has the functions `sum` and `product`? They are only working for `numbers`. It seems to me they are unrelated to the package.
U2D7NUGS1 : <@U3YDBDP4Z> if you install it with Brew it should *just work*. First you need to install Brew of course: <https://brew.sh/>
U2D7NUGS1 : Then ```brew install elm elm-format
``` should do the trick.

U3YDBDP4Z : <@U2D7NUGS1> Thanks for that! Now I need to solve the next issue of atom-elm-format not finding the elm-format binary
U2D7NUGS1 : Hmm. I have it working. Let me look at my config.
U2D7NUGS1 : It's probably because there is no executable named `elm-format` anymore. Use `elm-format-0.18`.
U3YDBDP4Z : <@U2D7NUGS1> That did it. :slightly_smiling_face: Thanks mate!
U2D7NUGS1 : Cool :slightly_smiling_face:
U2D7NUGS1 : I'll repeat my question from beginners here in hope for a quick answer:How can I handle Error result of `Json.Decode`? I have a snippet like this: ```
, on "opened-changed"
    (Json.Decode.string
        |&gt; <http://Json.Decode.at|Json.Decode.at> [ "detail", "value" ]
        |&gt; Json.Decode.map StringHappened
    )
```
where `StringHappened` is a constructor for my `Msg`. It just so happens that the `detail.value` is a `bool`. Currently in my app nothing happens. I want another variant of `Msg` to be used, say `ErrorHappened`. How can I do it?

U2D7NUGS1 : It's been addressed at <#C192T0Q1E|beginners> .
U37HUSJ4R : Is there an elm version of something like classnames? <https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames>
U4872964V : looks like it would work poorly with Elm’s type system
