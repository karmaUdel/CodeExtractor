ok, there's a better usage. variable response time for length of message, adjustable by the speed of the bot
so maybe the more professional bots respond at 150wpm
but the slower ones respond at 60.
nice
you are such a nerd erin
That's what I'm here for.
Perfecting the uncanny valley of text bots.
I could imagine a more involved or related function that also dictates speed between messages.
yeah
like a bot has a normal cadence
but also sometimes goes faster
a few quick short messages
thinking thinking thinking
I think Lark does a good job of this
Like, “Is the topic of this message similar to the last one? Ok, just start into the next time-appropriate delay.” Or “Is this topically different than the last message? +x delay for virtual context switching."
Agreed re: Lark's delay.
<@U05560TFT> that seems like a culture problem at the office, or what things like “feedback” channels should be for that you can opt into.
We still have everyone and channel and group all messages turned on with 800 people, and the only time we use them is for like “Hey, you need to enable 2fa or we're booting your account” types of messages.
People are pretty respectful so far (famous last words)...
<@U04S09GLN>: I think the difference is it's 90 different companies/300 people and most of them hungry entrepreneurs without reservations about spamming :stuck_out_tongue:
It's not just Slack either. We had a former resident spam the internal only email list last weekend promoting an Apple Watch hackathon
I think there's different sets of rules for Slack, based on whether it's a single company/group or a community Slack (like this, or the one i'm talking about for Runway)
Agreed.
But one of the whole value props for me is no spam.
same
Good luck on the new job <@U04SS2NBF> - From the other side of the ocean, "Slack" in my head is just an imaginary place, floating on some cloud.. Reading your thoughts, it's the first time I'm thinking of it as a physical place. This must be very exciting
Hey folks, nice to find a group of people thinking about building things with Slack
<@U0644KVQE>: hi, welcome. I think most of the channel is still asleep
Can I ask your opinion? How important is it for a bot to respond to out-of-scope requests? I mean, if I ask the scrumbot "make me a sandwich"  what would he ideally answer me?
Definitely at least an "I don't understand" response. 
Otherwise it's like clicking on a dialog box and getting no visual feedback. 
Agreed
Agreed!
I vote for a random response!
Then you can just mess with the bot 
<@U04SJBP5Q>: right?
Aw dang
Oh he only responds to dms
<@U04SM6T2H>: <https://twitter.com/hubflorin/status/608284735811362816>
okay. not easy. what would be a good response that would fit any of "make me a sandwich", "take me to the moon", "you're an idiot" , "I love you"?
(he's biased, he works for Slack. And I'm biased, I worked with Hub once upon a time.)
<@U055FHACC> Don't set the expectation too high
everybody knows its not a real person
so just let it be a bit weird
or say something simple like “I didn't get that."
FWIW, the PMBot I built does this when you talk to it out of context:
(Sorry, taskbot — so many bots!)
But once you have a robot persona in the channel, people keep testing his limits just to see what he'd do. And initial expectation I see is for a Hollywood-level AI (with a disappointment when he gets all confused). Among the "uninitiated" (non-robot-devs), they would totally treat him as a real person
your bot does calendar stuff right?
yes
I would focus on making it the raddest calendar app
and not try to make it seem like an AI
because there's enough AI in the calendar
and if you ask him for soemthing else he should be like
I am the best calendar bot in the world, and you ask me to “eat a butt robot bitch?"
heh
ha! good point
I made one of my bots be like
“would you like to hear a joke? I can't tell jokes I am a robot I have no emotions."
okay thats a bit sad. we're trying to make him all over-enthusiastic about scheduling. a scheduling buff
this is my favorite ost on that subject
<http://berglondon.com/blog/2010/09/04/b-a-s-a-a-p/>
yes I read that (from your medium article). Still, need to communicate total authority and power when it comes to doing his thing
"MXD" was exactly right. it's also very culturally biased
This is an impressive bot demo (watch the video) <https://twitter.com/piperlabs/status/608233759423479808>
I don't quite get it
it seems really anxious to get me a cab
but they made the setup pretty easy!!
now my whole team is arguing with it about not wanting a cab
holy cow, it requests an uber in the background assuming you'd say yes?
i didn't even click the link
so I'm not suire where it thinks it was sending a car
it doesn't do a great job of saying what its about
lol the bot does have A+ troll game though.
maybe that's the whole point?
heh
A bot that SWATs you
with uber cars
Ha! When I was toying with setting up a Slack-only consultancy, I talked to a couple of people. And one of them was obsessed with ordering Uber through Slack. He thought it was a killer feature.
Maybe this is the result.
sufficiently advanced bots are indistinguishable from internet trolls?
i think ordering uber via API is appealing because its like magic
something *real* happened
not just files copied
yeah i agree.
it's all still just exchanging json, but their json happens to command people.
NEST is similar
I hit that api
and boom
wind!
I've had three people mention they wished they could order food inside of Slack
like it was the one last remaining integration they wished existed. I wonder if Dominos has an API?
command line for everything
1) Postmates does
2) Pretty sure there's a few Hubot scripts floating around that work with Eat24 or Seamless
it might actually be better to do it the magic way: <http://getmagicnow.com>
2015-06-09T17:10:32.000665
re: uber: there is a hubot-uber script that i've used that works well, but doesn't have order capabilities. easy enough to add though <https://github.com/maxbeatty/hubot-uber>
<@U04S1QCPC> I wonder how that service scales, too.  a future of huge call-centers is WAY less fun than massive bot servers.
botfarm
human-powered bot farms, then
magic is actual humans but SMS only, and there is a little lag when you message them, so i'd imagine one CSR has multiple conversations going at once
I knew a guy years ago, and he had a start-up that provided homework help.  Kids would come home from school, have trouble, login and get a live tutor to walk them through the problems.
It wasn't working.
The tutors would spend most of their time waiting and then get crushed.
And so he brute-forced it.
He built an iPad app where the tutor would solve the problem, recording his voice as he did so.
And set them loose on the math textbooks for California and Texas, which are basically the two states that control what goes into our educational system.
And a month or so later, he had tutorial videos for every problem at every grade for (nearly) every public school.
And then he just hosted the videos, not going back to the live tutors.
<@U04T87ZQH>: <http://blog.skipflag.com/post/115410165746/foodbot-ai-for-lunch>
right, that group reverse-engineered the entire Sprig API by sniffing network packets on their iOS app
I suspect that could break very easily
Until the delivery services offer real APIs, you either need to do that, scrape + script, or have a human in the loop
If it's not core to your business, that might be good enough for now
also, not a big deal, but you'd need some way to tie a chat user to an account
and without a formal api, i'm going to guess you'd need users to give a bot some cookies
yup, just like scripting any other scraping process at that point.
Indentured servitude human-powered bot farms! If you owe  IOI (or Magic) money, you'll pay it off by serving time as a bot on their farm
piper bot has okay conversational skills
Is it possible to make a bot send a typing indicator? I thought it'd be a nice touch to make it seem slightly more human—even though it's fake. :wink:
This seems to work ok: `client._send({ type: "typing", channel: 'xyzzy' });` .. it's an undocumented feature, so fingers crossed it doesn't change too soon. :simple_smile:
Seems to make for an ok "loading" indicator on bot responses that take a few seconds of processing or more.
:thumbsup:
Do any of you handle bots that connect with multiple teams/rooms at the same time?
The examples I've come across to date are typically “run this process to connect this bot to a single team"
<@U04SX1L23>: good find!!
<@U0644KVQE>: I'm going to be experimenting with that today
<@U04SX1L23>: meaning one could conceivably make a bot where all it does is randomly send typing indicators to a channel
<@U04SX1L23>: <@U04SM6T2H> we use the typing indicator and its awesome
makes things feel way more human
yeah that's a really cool find
wow, typing indicator would be a great add to hubot-slack too
although that might be a bit too late in the game, may need to implement it into hubot directly, something like send typing indicator if any of the listeners match
Oh man
yeah
typing indicator
so rad!!
so rad
couple that typing indicator with the text-length-slowness snippet, and you'll have realism!
^ agreed!
“realism"
oh shit!
someone just built a market data slackbot in the office.
that responds to requests, quote lookups, etc.
rad!
it does charting too
err, hooked up bigcharts, at least

hey slack api experts, I have a question.
So, bots can monitor channels for words, and respond automatically. Not slash commands, but parsing the text. We were talking about that on here a week or so ago.
Can bots also monitor the _expanded_ text from oembed links, like above?
Like, pretend I had an api that could do entity extraction on a block of text, and give me all company names.
Could I have that run on the auto-expanded preview text from links as well?
hrrm
lets test it
ha
Just realized that you can't create a #slack channel.
Says it's already been created.
And if you try to join, it brings up the create channel prompt.
it looks like you do get the attachments!
noice.
The whole excerpt?
its as if you sent it in via the api
same format
INTERESTING
so yes
Can you determine that it was created as the result of a link?
well
Like, if I were to make an integration that followed-up on any link by examining the companies mentioned in the preview text, and auto-responded with current stock charts about them.
yes
you can see that the original message
was just a link
but I only wanted it to do so in respond to links pasted
and it has an attachment
so like
if (message.text.match(link_regexp) &amp;&amp; message.attachments.length) { // do something )
ah, got it.
so yes, yes, is the short answer.
that is interesting.
they are supposd to be able to do *anything* a real user can
and get the same data that real clients get
almost anything I guess
not kick other users from channels :wink:
re: typing status: here's a PR for hubot that adds middleware to listeners <https://github.com/github/hubot/pull/803>
<http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/>
A different type of bot :simple_smile:
so cute
if you reload the page he says different smart things
Herro, <@U067YU0V7> !
there's now a chat bot talk circuit. <http://creativepulse.co/boris-mann/>
whoa!
I want in!
I just had an hour long discussion with a London based research organization about “bots in the workplace"
hey dave
Hi <@U04SM6T2H> thanks for the invite.  Excited to dig into what you all are doing over here!
:simple_smile:
lots of good stuff
So have you built out your polling bot yet?
Not yet, hoping to bang that out this weekend
:simple_smile:
So far, just implemented hubot
cool
There's a fair amount of abstraction ontop of the RTM api to achieve what I've got in our @PMBOT
RTM?
real time messaging
oh, hah
that's how pmbot works
also <@U0614LL8Y>
who is turned on here
are you basically just running your own server that rolls through and pings users through the RTM api?
yes
I mean
in effect, yes
we're building out a bunch of bot running infrastructure
to build and host a bunch of different types of bots
and hope to make them available to people as a product
but TLDR;  Node using the RTM api and a structure like a game loop
that lets the bots be proactive
Ah, makes total sense
our bots are like NPC characters :simple_smile:
that was a redundant phrase
Yessss
but yeah
its very much like a game loop with player objects doing stuff
that's how I was thinking about it
because I think I'm just going to set up an internal server for all of our automation, with bots as worker bees
:simple_smile: :simple_smile: :simple_smile:
I just gave in and bought <http://botfarm.co|botfarm.co>
heh
Hah
Nice.
Man, parsing through the backchatter here has me really excited about doing more development for our Slack.  Thanks for drawing me in with your medium post <@U04SM6T2H> .
:tada:
:confetti_ball:
booya :simple_smile:
I'm really trying to host an open and productive community here!
Hopefully we can all share in the learning!
Sounds good to me
hi ADAM!

Has anyone run into this bug? Normally when you upload a file to a user via direct message—the "Share with" dropdown refers to that user... but in my case when people upload a file to my bot user.. the drop down has the name of a public channel instead.
For example.. here I'm uploading a file to my bot user called `tasks-bot` but the dropdown is showing `#announcements`.
I dreamed that I built a bot that could change the art on my walls
So, next step is surrounding yourself with digital displays running a network connected device...
