U0HK9D8AG : I think it is using the wrong directory, how do I fix that?
U0HK9D8AG : <http://pastebin.com/jEynQSkQ>
U0HK9D8AG : I'm new to NPM, sorry if I'm being a bit of an idiot
U0HERRQR1 : What is your npm &amp; node version?
U0HERRQR1 : this is a problem with library `ws`
U0HK9D8AG : let me check
U0HK9D8AG : I just installed the latest nodejs
U0HERRQR1 : ```Can't find Python executable "python", you can set the PYTHON env variable.```
U0HK9D8AG : oh
U0HERRQR1 : there exist a stackoverflow question <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21365714/nodejs-error-installing-with-npm>
U0HERRQR1 : ```So to install it on windows you must first :Install python: <http://www.python.org/getit/windows/>
Install Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2012 Express version: <http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9816758>
Install node-gyp: npm install -g node-gyp

U0HK9D8AG : Thank you. Either I forgot to reinstall it, or it wasn't in the first place
U0HERRQR1 : Probably
U0HERRQR1 : not a problem btw. feel free to message me in priv. if you have any further questions on this manner
U0HK9D8AG : alright

U0HK9D8AG : hello
U0FSRDKHN : <@U0HERRQR1> and <@U0HK9D8AG>, unless there is something particularly private about the NPM issue that you're discussing, I recommend that you talk about it in <#C0HKMD3FA> instead of in private. Because there will certainly be other folks that will run into the same or similar problems. <@U0HJXBKE0>
U0HK9D8AG : Alrighty
U0HERRQR1 : You're right rafael. But it was an error particular to seth itself.
U0HERRQR1 : It wasn't a botkit error.
U0HERRQR1 : It was a Nodejs installation error.
U0HK9D8AG : yep, but I'll make sure to post there in case of botkit specific errors
U0HERRQR1 : Okey
U0HK9D8AG : Anyone have about 10 minutes to help me get my botkit storage running?
U0FSRDKHN : <@U0HK9D8AG> What's up?

U0EAC51EJ : isn't <http://Wit.ai|Wit.ai> a voice-command tool, or does it work with text also?
U0HDXGVDF : works with text too. i haven't even tried the voice piece.
U0AQ8GPGR : So the <http://botwiki.org/monthly-bot-challenge|botwiki.org/monthly-bot-challenge> has officially started :simple_smile: Everyone is welcome to join!

U0FSRDKHN : &gt;GOOD NEWS! <@U0F7LRC5A> who works at :slack:Slack has agreed to give Dev4Slack a free subscription so that we can test out our bots together. I think that Dev4Slack can now become the absolute :robot_face: :cloud: Bot Heaven that it was always meant to be! Please thank <@U0F7LRC5A> for making this possible. 
&gt;Protocol to keep things reasonably organized: For any bot that you add, please create a channel called *#bot-&lt;name of the bot&gt;* and add the bot there. That'll prevent us from all bombing our bots into <#C04SM6TAK> and making too much craziness.

U04SM6T2H : how goes your keen bot?
U04SM6T2H : i want it :simple_smile:
U0HMV5D62 : I'm working on the flow of how you actually know what to query. Like for example, you have no idea any of your project names or event collections.
U0HMV5D62 : Luckily Keen has a pretty nice API that has helped a ton. :wink:
U04SM6T2H : :simple_smile:
U08AK3DQ8 : Hi guys, I made <https://slofile.com/>, a new place to find &amp; advertise public Slack groups like this.This works like an combination of Chit Chats and Slackin - you can advertise your slack group and invite new user in one place, without hosting your own Slackin.
If you are running public Slack community, or looking for other cool community to join, please check it out.

U0HBN0L9M : same here, would like to show my app <http://www.smooz.io|www.smooz.io> in a channel, but it requires admin auth
U0HBN0L9M : It's a bot that allows one-click connection between two Slack teams, in a dedicated channel
U08AK3DQ8 : <@U0HBN0L9M>: Hi, nice app. I was thinking to make the app which does exactly same thing with yours, but then came up with an easy solution.
U08AK3DQ8 : Create ‘user community' Slack of your service and invite users to there. Then talk with users on that Slack. This is the example. <https://slofile.com/teams/slofile>
U0HBN0L9M : yep, some teams do that
U0HBN0L9M : but then you have to invite people as channel-only users, and they have to use again another slack
U0HBN0L9M : might work for some use case, not for others… I have teams for example two startups in an incubator, discussing lunch plans
U0HBN0L9M : both teams « stay on their slacks"
U0HBN0L9M : would be glad to give you an early access if you want to try out
U08AK3DQ8 : ah, sure when the teams are not service-users relation, direct connection makes sence
U0HBN0L9M : yes
U0HBN0L9M : although I do have also very « star-like » users, who use slack as a newsletter tool, where your solution might be technically simpler. However, the connected users like to have « add one channel » instead of « add one slack team »
U08AK3DQ8 : for 'channel-only' - I meant making 2 Slack teams - one for private and one for public. members in public team don't need to be channel-only just normal member. Product Hunt is doing this style.
U0HBN0L9M : oh ok sure
U0HBN0L9M : I was refering to other examples I know of, but you're right
U0HBN0L9M : when you want to animate a community it's ideal
U08AK3DQ8 : yep sometimes discussions between users solves problem, or give better feedback to the operator. especially the product has deep learning curve and lot of features.
U0HBN0L9M : Indeed. Different use case. <http://smooz.io|smooz.io> is not intended for many-to-many, rather for one-to-one or one-to-many
U06E352LU : hello <@U0HMV5D62> :simple_smile:
U0FSRDKHN : <@U0HBN0L9M>: I just joined the waitlist for _Smooz_
U0HBN0L9M : Nice :) 
U0HBN0L9M : Will jump you ahead <@U0FSRDKHN> 
U0HBN0L9M : Same thing for other members of this chat, by the way 
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0HBN0L9M>: is it possible you talked with Blanca?
U0HBN0L9M : Yes, definitely! 
U0CS6NSF5 : is it a pet project, or are you going turn it into a paid service? :simple_smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : the homepage doesn't say
U0HBN0L9M : yeah, right now it's a pet project, I want people to use it and see how it goes
U0HBN0L9M : if there are heavy corporate use, I'll think of a paid plan
U0HBN0L9M : it would be easy to monetize I guess, if I reach serious usage level, like what you guys are doing, or others like smooch. But right now I want to scale users &amp; understand their needs
U0CS6NSF5 : we actually did something similar, but we had  a pricing table at <http://slackline.io|slackline.io> from day one
U0CS6NSF5 : people requested early access knowing it was going to be a paid service
U0HBN0L9M : it is clearly the right way to do it
U0HBN0L9M : I've been meaning to do it but… :smile:
U0644KVQE : <@U0CS6NSF5>: did Slack request you add the little "Slackline is an independent product” banner at the top?
U0HMV5D62 : Hey <@U06E352LU>! :simple_smile:
U0GPSB7V1 : yay new icon for this slack team :simple_smile:

U04SM6T2H : Cool article today from Fast Co Design about designing for messaging:
U04SM6T2H : <http://www.fastcodesign.com/3054934/the-next-phase-of-ux-designing-chatbot-personalities>
U0GQ0G4PL : Anyone currently doing anything with multiple/variable bot personalities currently?
U0D7LHNTX : If you are in the SF area later this month, this is the event for you: <http://www.meetup.com/SlackDevs/events/227849675/> :slack:
U0HDXGVDF : We need an Austin meetup!
U04S3JCH2 : We had a bot meetup in October!
U04S3JCH2 : But don't worry - planning something big for 2016 :simple_smile:
U0HDXGVDF : nice! slack dev wasn't on my radar then, but I'm looking forward to what you all have planned. :upside_down_face:
U04S3JCH2 : Rad! There is an “official" SXSW bot/messaging meetup that Ben and I are hosting, but want to do something unofficial around or before that time, too.
U04S3JCH2 : We'll post about that stuff in <#C08SZGBGR> if you want to join that.
U0CSBGTKM : do you guys have the authority to comp entires for non-badgeholders? :smile:
U04S3JCH2 : Hah I wish. That's why we're going to do something unofficial too!
U0CSBGTKM : haha I'll consider it a challenge, then
U0CSBGTKM : managed to weasel my way into a couple Rackspace &amp; Capital Factory events in the past
U0CSBGTKM : :sleuth_or_spy:
U04S3JCH2 : Well we did a similar meetup a few years ago, they literally give you a chained off area on 6th street and an open bar. Kinda weird but cool!
U07HXFWUD : <@U0D7LHNTX>: that looks like a cool event :simple_smile:
U0D7LHNTX : It is in fact <@U07HXFWUD>'s event :smile:
U0GP7QN7L : any events coming up in Vancouver?
U07HXFWUD : you should ask @silentrob  &gt; <@U0GP7QN7L>
U0GP7QN7L : <@U07HXFWUD>: I don't see them in the team directory here
U07HXFWUD : he made superscript and based in vancouver (works for slack there)
U0HPZF95H : Hi
U07HXFWUD : the genie is magically here :simple_smile:
U0CNYC404 : <@U055FHACC> great post, food for thought.  We have actually solved the context switching problem with our system, so in your meeting to delete example that is solvable :simple_smile:  Must give meekan a play sometime
U0GP7QN7L : good summoning skills <@U07HXFWUD>
U0HPZF95H : So there are no events happening in Vancouver (slack sponsored) but we could always put something together.
U0HPZF95H : I'm not that guy, but I can connect the dots
U0GP7QN7L : sure lets do it
U0HPZF95H : or if you want to do a more casual hangout, Im always game for that too.
U0CSBGTKM : slackbot &amp; chill :tm:
U0CSBGTKM : showing myself out...
U0GP7QN7L : well <@U0HPZF95H>, maybe a couple less formal hangouts would be good and then people can figure out what they'd want to do for a bigger production
U0GP7QN7L : sort of preliminary meetings
U0HPZF95H : how many vancouver people do we have here?
U0HPZF95H : that would be interested?
U06UZ1RKQ : Hi guys. Need to make a presentation for my company's retreat. Was thinking making it about bots. Any ideas on how to make it somewhat fun?
U0E6D1UFJ : Anyone using/testing <http://awesome.ai|awesome.ai>'s bot?  Would love to see some screenshots of the “sidebar” feature.
U0CSBGTKM : <@U06UZ1RKQ>: if your company makes a software product, a bot that talks with said product might be kinda cool
U0CSBGTKM : or some tedious product that you use day-to-day
U06UZ1RKQ : we do mostly websites :simple_smile: but might work
U06UZ1RKQ : since the websites have content: word definitions, sinonims, ...
U0GPKTHQ9 : We should totally have a slack meetup in London as well! Anybody from London here? Join us in <#C0HLEF9NZ>
U0HMDQVF1 : <http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/05/facebook-messenger-bots/>
U0HMDQVF1 : what do you guys think about this?
U0H88ASGK : I think thats a big step. Bots are very powerful as we all already know.
U0HMDQVF1 : I agree that it's a good sign. But, at the same time, I have doubts about building on top of platforms and limitations of messenger ux.
U0HMDQVF1 : Would be interesting to see if messenger-first movement will happen like it did for mobile
U0HMDQVF1 : i guess it will be more like bot-first
U055FHACC : <@U0CNYC404>: curious to hear the details for this.. can you post an example? I mean, what happens when you receive a “chain” of three events, and you actually want to respond to #2?  We're now cheating by attaching response emojis to every line (I say “cheating” because this is now not a pure conversation. I mean, it will not work with a voice service like Amazon Echo)
U0CNYC404 : <@U055FHACC> we track each 'conversation' seperately within a request, and we know the contex/input we are expecting.  If a comment doesn't match the expected input for the newest conversation, and isn't a trigger for a new conversation, it walks back through previous conversations that are still active to find a match (it can walk through 'n' but we limit it to 3 to avoid user confusion) eg:
U0CNYC404 : Eurgh, how do you do new lines in the mobile UI
U0CNYC404 : Will write an example when I get to my laptop :)
U0HR2HWCQ : Hey all! PHP Developer from Essex, England here! How you all doing?
U055FHACC : <@U0CNYC404>: I think I understand (still curious to see an example when you can). but I'm thinking about same-kind events, like:Joey invited you to a meetings. You can `accept` or `decline`
[A minute later] Dan invited you to a a meeting. You can `accept` or `decline`

So an `accept` will work for the last one, but  the user lost the ability to respond to the first one. Unless I'll give them special attributes. Like number the incoming events, and then you can `accept 1` and `decline 2` which is not too elegant

U055FHACC : welcome <@U0HR2HWCQ>
U0HBN0L9M : <@U0HMDQVF1> you have doubts about platform yet build on slack ?
U0HBN0L9M : (although I agree that Slack shows an awesome attitude towards dev. I think that's what you mean?)
U0CNYC404 : <@U055FHACC> we cope with that as well, as long as you deal with them in reverse order, if you want to deal with them in a random order, then yeah, unique ref's is the only way to do it
U055FHACC : <@U0CNYC404>: what's your way to let the user know which item is “alive”?
U0CNYC404 : <@U055FHACC> whichever is last updated (so following how a natural conversation would work)
U055FHACC : yes. well, that's can break in so many ways. Like, if he's typing something, and another one comes in before he sends his command..
U0CNYC404 : ```A:where can I get food nearbyB: what kind of cuisine would you like
A: whats the weather forecast
B: sunny until 7pm
A: lets go for barbeque
B: Great, a list of barbeque restaurants are…```

U0CNYC404 : <@U055FHACC> yup, understood, thats why you would need to use refs to be sure
U055FHACC : That's nice. We forget about the first one when a the conversation takes a new direction, for the sake of simplicity. We found that it could cause more confusion than help
U0CNYC404 : yeah, I may let customers set the number to remember on a case by case basis for that reason, as it can cause confusion
U055FHACC : brave new world :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : I would look to text adventure games
U04SM6T2H : There are 2 things to accept 
U04SM6T2H : You say accept 
U04SM6T2H : Bot says sorry accept Ben or accept Eric 
U04TLHGSC : "I would look to text adventure games" whoda thunk it


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
	If Yes:
	1.Bad	2.Very bad
	If No:
	1.Good	2.Very good


How confident are you?
	1.Low
	2.Average
	3.High
