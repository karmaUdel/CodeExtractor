or something of that ilk
<@U26LR8F4H> do you want to re-render before scrolling to the top?
that would be a nice touch :slightly_smiling_face:
mm, also a good question. It might make sense to bounce through an update
and just have a `Pageupdate` message
which then issues a scroll
thanks, i think  i have some fiddling todo.
<@U26LR8F4H> if you want to re-render then you need to go through `update` which you can't do by chaining Tasks
So the first task issues an http request then the andThen will run before the update function is called?
yes, when you chain with `andThen` the tasks are carried out in sequence behind the scene
only dispatching a message when the chain is complete and returning early if any issues an error
