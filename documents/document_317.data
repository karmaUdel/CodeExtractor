Maybe I could write a port that returns that last PDT bit and map to the timezones
sounds a bit hacky though
`new Date().getTimezoneOffset();`
gives me `420`
so 7 hours?
I'm assuming that 420 minutes
that makes sense given the previous output from the browser (GMT-0700)
Strangely there doesn't seem to be any way of constructing a timezone from the offset :confused:
i guess I do have another api endpoint that gives me my profiles current timezone
but it sure would be nicer to get it from the browser
Typically you would want Timezone to be configurable right? Instead of always getting it from the system?
i guess?
seems like the burden of setting the correct timezone should be on the system, not the user
(to the contrary of what you just said)
so if you go to a different timezone everything "just works"
As long as it can be overridden
instead of going and clicking a drop down
yeah
like, if we were going to meet up at 5pm, i would want the software we are using to be smart enough to show timezones in a helpful manner
I used to have French set as the default language on my computer it it would get super annoyed when sites would auto-redirect me to their French site, even when I specifically requested the English version
I could see something similar happening with timezones
i worked on some bilingual software and my browser would always try to auto translate the text
which got confusing with debugging
hmm, it's rendering the wrong language....
oh wiat
dang it google!
lol
`List.map #random messages`
`fromName : String -&gt; Maybe TimeZone`
so that's what i need to use now
Say I'm traveling and I want to set up a meeting on my return. I'd want to set the meeting for 10AM in my home time zone, not whatever time zone I'm in right now
so this use case is with messages
i wonder if I want to know what time you sent me the message in your timezone
or maybe just show them in my timezone and then warn if the user is in a different timezone
I think I'd want to see what time the message was sent in _my_ timezone?
so do you see a "5:24" time stamp on this slack message?
Yes
i see "2:24"
on your message
does it mater to me that it's a bit later where you are?
Maybe?
i guess if it does i click your face
This is probably a case where you want to do some user research for your specific use case.
right
In Slack's case, I'm guessing they came to the conclusion that you mostly care about the time a message was sent in relation to your current time
but you might occasionally want to know the time of day of the other person
woot just figured it out~
