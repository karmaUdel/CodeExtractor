U0CQ254F5 : <@U5QJW0DDE> as for embedding elm within a react app, i agree with <@U3SJEDR96>, its relatively straightforward and a good way for teams to test it out
U5P4FLYLE : Hi,  I would like to go elegantly from `values`:```type Poly                                                                                                                                                                                  
     = Float Float                                                                                                                                                                          
     | String String                                                                                                                                                                        
     | Date Date.Date
xval=List Poly
yval=List List Poly
values=(xval,yval) 
```
to  extractedValues which has type `(List Date, List List Float)`
How do you pattern match something like that?

U3SJEDR96 : easiest would be `List.unzip values |&gt; List.foldr (\val (dates, strings, floats) -&gt; case val of *pattern match and prepend it to the correct entry*) ([], [], [])`
U3SJEDR96 : or you can do it in one go, too, if you write a function `Poly -&gt; (List Date, List String, List Float) -&gt; (List Date, List String, List Float)`
U3SJEDR96 : Or wait, I totally misunderstood :smile:
U3SJEDR96 : sec
U3SJEDR96 : <https://ellie-app.com/3BNZD5X5DKKa1/0> <@U5P4FLYLE> something like that I suppose
U5P4FLYLE : thanks, <@U3SJEDR96>
U60DVU1PS : Is there any article/documentation covering the reasoning for using "-&gt;" in anonymous functions?  Apologies if this is an obvious matter.
U2W8J47KQ : I would guess it's because Haskell does the same
U5Y2S6SJF : is it possible to pass in a "none" function to main's update argument? similar to subscriptions?
```
 , subscriptions = (\_ -&gt; Sub.none)
```

U0LPMPL2U : `always Sub.none` ?
U0LPMPL2U : oh wait, for `update` :stuck_out_tongue:
U5Y2S6SJF : yeah i figured that was coupled to subscriptions so didn't try
U0LPMPL2U : You want something like this?```
, update = (\msg model -&gt; (model, Cmd.none))
```

U5Y2S6SJF : That should work. Get's a lot closer to my goal than writing out a basic update and pattern matching on a NoOp msg
U0LPMPL2U : I suppose you could also do:```
, update = always init
```

assuming you have an `init` function that returns an initial model and `Cmd.none`

U0CLDU8UB : Nope, that would expect just a single argument.
```
, update = \_ _ -&gt; init
```
would work though.

U0LPMPL2U : good catch :thumbsup:
U5Y2S6SJF : thanks.. i guess i should of been able to figure that out if i read the types in the documentation :slightly_smiling_face:
U0LPMPL2U : It can be easier to start by writing a constant `update` function before translating to an anonymous function. e.g.```
update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
update _ model =
  (model, Cmd.none)

-- OR

update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
update _ _ -&gt;
  init
```

U5Y1YQD6Y : y'all, does Elm have a concept of `unless`?
U3SJEDR96 : Nope.
U0JFGGZS6 : `if (not x) then ..  else ..` ?


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
	If Yes:
	1.Bad	2.Very bad
	If No:
	1.Good	2.Very good


How confident are you?
	1.Low
	2.Average
	3.High
