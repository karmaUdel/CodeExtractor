OH -
Why does it compile then?
Change the name
is this a known bug in Elm?
Because it correctly figures out what update you are using, but generates the wrong code.
Ye.s
But please don't do that anyway: it makes your code very hard to read
:point_up:
No, sure, I wouldn't do that by default - and didn't notice
and will change it - just I was factoring out that operation (it is used in several other Msg values that I didn't list - ) and didn't realize the name conflict - I was stuck thinking it was somehow my polymorphic use of `clearHoveredSlot`
yay - no more hangs - thanks all!
struggling to see how you would dynamically set a value inside let.
