    Http.Request String```
<@U0JBSEGHY> ReceiveToken takes a Model not a String
Yea this is where I keep tripping up in all the various ways I have tried
You need to change ReceiveToken so it takes a String
My model contains other stuff... which isn't in the Json response
Can ReceiveToken take a string and then in your update you can update it in your model?
OH!!
Damn Types.... haha
still getting used to it :sweat_smile:
Look at the type of Http.send
I had this `| ReceiveToken (Result Http.Error String)`  saying Model. Which I have now changed.
Ok I'm getting an error / not getting anything back when I make the request :disappointed:
Try logging the `Err` case to the console using `Debug.log`, or inspecting the messages in the debugger
