no, I do not use wildcard
That was not about `map`, I should have formed question better. I know about the libraries API, I was really looking into different way of data modelling, not into suggestions for methods to use :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U0H3A9XLN> a different way than _what_ is the obvious question. If you can't provide an example on how your code looks now it's extremely hard to suggest improvements.
Gets confusing to know if `red` is from `Style.Color` or from `Color` - elmjutsu shows intelisense for both combined. - i mean not so confusing for red - but i'm worried about the implications for other function names if this is allowed
