U2LAL86AY : <@U2Q3QE54G> have you tested the same functionlity in js -  to make sure that what you have there is not a browser problem ?!
U0JL9RPC4 : Hi! Do you think it would possible somehow to use Elm as a desktop native application in order to get access to local files, directories, etc?
U0JL9RPC4 : `elm-native-ui` seems to be mobile oriented
U35100SJD : I never tried but maybe you should look at electon elm
U0JL9RPC4 : ho thanks, I found this <https://medium.com/@ezekeal/building-an-electron-app-with-elm-part-1-boilerplate-3416a730731f>
U0U6ML22H : Gnome3 extensions are in JS
U0U6ML22H : there might be some bridges there
U0JL9RPC4 : I need a crossplatform solution (at least windows and linux)
U0PBSF05S : <@U0JL9RPC4> See also <#C0K90DV3M|electron>. Recent discussion in <#C0K8VHA6B|help> too.
U0U6ML22H : OK, I assumed you knew about <#C0K90DV3M|electron> and was offering other ideas :smiley:
U1R5JCM55 : Anyone got a good trick for moving all your Elm modules under a new namespace? i.e.```
ModuleA =&gt; NewNamespace.ModuleA
ModuleB =&gt; NewNamespace.ModuleB
```

U37BWE0SU : This is not elm-specific, but im throwing it out here: I realize again and again that I'm exceptionally terrible at web design. I can recognize good and bad design (most of the time) but I'm unable to create someting even remotely good looking from scratch. Are there some good "web design basics for hopeless developers" out there?
U37BWE0SU : I love building web pages in elm, but it does not help me with my main problem, the lack of design skills...
U4PT7NG4V : That's a very interesting question. You're absolutely not alone :slightly_smiling_face: I'd be interested in any resources like that too
U4PT7NG4V : I've read some interesting articles that might be relevant at <https://design.google/>
U0PBSF05S : <@U37BWE0SU> I'm in the same boat. I try to leverage whatever "frameworks" I can. I have been recently using elm-mdl (see <#C12KMAYJX|elm-mdl>) but I'm not sure about the long term viability of it now that Google's Material Design Lite is being replaced by Material Design Components. There is elm-bootstrap (see <#C3U2E3JRX|elm-bootstrap>), but I have not tried it yet. I'm a bit gunshy of making a committment to something not knowing if it will be around for a while. There are <#C13J25YQK|webcomponents> but does not seem to be a solid consensus about how and what that looks like just yet. My tendency is to use something like purecss for it's classes just to make things look a bit better.
U1R5JCM55 : I wanted to move all of my elm files under a new directory, find and sed to the rescue…
U37BWE0SU : interesting. I've used bootstrap a lot before, but i think it makes the dom too complicated. I'll check out your links, thanks a lot :slightly_smiling_face:
U1R5JCM55 : <@U37BWE0SU> I found this article on hierarchy was a good start, <https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-visual-hierarchy-in-web-design--webdesign-84>
U1R5JCM55 : I also found that Gestalt theory had a lot in common with how I organise code in projects, <http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/gestalt-theory-10134960>
U5GJ5FEAU : yeah! sometimes i wish modules could be relatively namespaced based on the folder they were in. That'd be cool
U1R5JCM55 : When the elm-format AST is ready we should be able to put together a tool for applying refactorings like this.
U0J8D9M2P : what to expect from 0.19 version?
U5SQ9CVLP : <https://github.com/elm-lang/projects/blob/master/roadmap.md>
U5SQ9CVLP : The major focus of 0.19 will be creating “single-page apps” in Elm. The features that fall under that umbrella include:
   - Server-side rendering — sending HTML with the initial response
   - Tree shaking — trimming out unused code (usually called dead-code elimination or DCE)
   - Code splitting — cutting up code into smaller chunks for better caching
   -  Lazy loading — only sending the code chunks needed for a particular page

U17R1GD96 : Is there any Elm module for using media queries?
U17R1GD96 : Something like <https://www.npmjs.com/package/match-media>
U1CE9DL9H : <@U17R1GD96> not directly, but style-elements has something like it <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/style-elements/3.1.0/Element#classifyDevice>, uses a subscription to catch scaling and such, parses it into a nice record that you can base whatever on.
U1CE9DL9H : you can probably replicate that
U5GJ5FEAU : 0.19 is probably a little far off in the future. or is it coming soon?
U17R1GD96 : <@U1CE9DL9H> There are no useful examples showing how to use that. The only link to a real example about Element.classifyDevice works is dead :disappointed:
U1CE9DL9H : you can still replicate it. Set up a subscription to <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/window/1.0.1/Window#resizes> to aquire a `Window.Size` value, then process that like here <https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements/blob/032a0503ad3a7a32c8efc8fbc12c26dc4f211d0b/src/Element.elm#L1099>
U5T739RFW : would like to know too.
U3KSN5MAL : Heya guys. I have a problem and so far the webgl guys haven't been able to help. 
So i need to load in an obj using the elm-obj library, which works fine using elm-live

U3KSN5MAL : But it seems that using elm make to make the js.file and loading it off my HDD (how it has to work in a photoshop plugin) tries to load the obj file as a html file and so it breaks the parsing
U3KSN5MAL : Is there something i have to put in to make sure it actually loads in properly?
U1CE9DL9H : how is the file loaded ? are you using some webserver?
U3KSN5MAL : no
U3KSN5MAL : it's not web stuff, it's a photoshop plugin
U3KSN5MAL : The library creator identified it as a bug with elm-reactor, because the same thing happens with reactor, but it works with elm-live
U1CE9DL9H : that's possible, elm-reactor, for a while, also tried to load css files as html files
U3KSN5MAL : hmm
U1CE9DL9H : I think it's a header issue
U3KSN5MAL : Ok, is that something i can modify in my custom html file
U3KSN5MAL : because this is proving to be a hard thing to google
U3KSN5MAL : ianmackenzie mentioned headers with `Accept: text/plain` but i have no idea where that would even go
U1CE9DL9H : so, how do you get the .obj file into your elm app?
U3KSN5MAL : ` Http.toTask (Http.getString url)`
U3KSN5MAL : pretty sure that's the line that grabs it
U3KSN5MAL : <https://github.com/Zinggi/elm-obj-loader/blob/master/src/OBJ.elm>
U1CE9DL9H : you can add custom headers with <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#request>
U3KSN5MAL : Neat! i'll have a look
U5SQ9CVLP : We'd all like to know. But nobody does, including the main developpers :wink:
U41NK9BM4 : <@U3KSN5MAL> The thing I don't understand of how the file gets read from the filesystem. Do you have access to the code? Is it using some sort of File API <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader> or via HTTP?
U5GCK308N : Is there a tool to make elm apps online like `ellie-app` but with `Html.program`?
U0EUHKVGB : <@U5GCK308N> Yes, ellie-app
U0EUHKVGB : Just change main to use `Html.program` as you would locally.
U0EUHKVGB : It’s a valid Elm file.
U5GCK308N : oops you are right
U5GCK308N : Thank you
U5X2VC483 : Anyone working on a language server protocol server for elm?Is there any other way to add completion/hover info/goto definition etc to an editor?

U4872964V : <@U5X2VC483> check out <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExGkdmey0n4>
U4872964V : not really a direct answer to your question, but anway :slightly_smiling_face:
U5X2VC483 : thanks <@U4872964V>
U0J8D9M2P : Is Prezi the first Elm in production?
U0K7EBT3J : hello
U0K7EBT3J : I'm getting an error installing elm packages in travis
U0K7EBT3J : `rename: already exists (File exists)`
U0K7EBT3J : errors like these:`elm-make: evancz-url-parser-57d713a: rename: already exists (File exists)`
`elm-make: elm-lang-html-1208e71: rename: already exists (File exists)`

U0K7EBT3J : any ideas?
U0EUHKVGB : i think you're running elm package twice in two different threads.
U0K7EBT3J : hmm yeah, i'm using `sysconfcpus -n 2` so elm-make can go faster
U0K7EBT3J : i'll install before compiling then
U0K7EBT3J : or I might change to circleci, where I don't need that sysconfcpus hack
U0EUHKVGB : Yep
U0EUHKVGB : I generally recommend running elm-package yourself before anything else, including webpack etc
U31AUNK6F : Is it safe to say that everything in Elm is a function? So if i declare a "variable/constant" `ten = 10` is `ten` than a function of a value?
U1CE9DL9H : you can think of constants as zero-argument functions
U1CE9DL9H : so all elm values can be thought of as functions, if that helps
U31AUNK6F : Alright thank you <@U1CE9DL9H>
U4872964V : <@U31AUNK6F> i think it depends on why you want to call it a function. mathematically it’s not a function
U1CE9DL9H : but any value of type `a` is isomorphic to a function `() -&gt; a` (in the sense that they contain the same amount of information). So, there is some theoretical base for considering them the same.
U4872964V : Sure. As I said, it depends on why you want to call it a function. There is a useful distinction in Elm between values and functions, values being the end result of applying functions, where you can’t apply anything anymore.
U5DJNFLUD : Thought y'all might enjoy <https://twitter.com/mrb_bk/status/877558038030372869>
U35100SJD : hi there
U35100SJD : I made a new package : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/FabienHenon/elm-infinite-list-view/latest> . It's about rendering infinite lists, by displaying only visible elements. Feedback appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:
U0K92QFST : <@U31AUNK6F> <@U1CE9DL9H> important to note that you can think of a constant as a zero-argument function, but it compiles to a Javascript variable, not a function.
U0K92QFST : For example, the following is impossible in Elm:```undefined = Debug.crash "Undefined"```

U3SJEDR96 : the joys of a strict language :slightly_smiling_face:
U5AQ585NH : Does anybody know when [this](<https://github.com/elm-lang/dom/blob/1.1.1/src/Dom/Size.elm>) will be included in the library?
U21QZSK36 : Has anyone had any experience with contentEditable divs? More specifically, in binding the value of the div to some content. It appears that whenever the value of the content is updated, the cursor moves to the beginning of the input element, meaning that you'd be typing in reverse.  This seems to happen whether you set the value with Html.text or if you set the innerHTML directly from Html.Attributes.property. Has anyone else experienced this, or worked around it? I'm trying to avoid porting out to JS if possible.
U33N2MR2T : <@U21QZSK36> I tried using one of those for a while and gave up on it.
U33N2MR2T : If you insist on using contentEditable, I’d recommend just catching the `input` events in JS and forwarding the current value through to Elm on a port.
U33N2MR2T : This kind of thing is a known issue with virtual-dom based renderers.
U33N2MR2T : Basically, the element is being re-created and the editing state (such as where the cursor is) is lost.
U33N2MR2T : You might be able to deal with it somewhat with `Html.Keyed.node`.
U33N2MR2T : I hadn’t seen this until after I moved on to the JS side.
