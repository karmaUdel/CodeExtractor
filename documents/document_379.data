U3YDBDP4Z : Ah, right
U3YDBDP4Z : Thanks <@U3SJEDR96>
U3YDBDP4Z : Not getting it to work.```
onFormSubmit : (String -&gt; msg) -&gt; Html.Attribute msg
onFormSubmit tagger =
    let
        options =
            { stopPropagation = False
            , preventDefault = True
            }
    in
        Events.onWithOptions "submit" options (Json.map tagger targetData)
```

Used like `onFormSubmit SignIn` on the form.

Causes a page reload.

U3YDBDP4Z : Switching the line `onFormSubmit SignIn` to the built in `onSubmit SignIn` works
U3YDBDP4Z : But the implementations look identitical…
U3SJEDR96 : what is targetData?
U3YDBDP4Z : Json decoder
U3YDBDP4Z : The same as the built in targetValue decoder
U3SJEDR96 : you'll probably want to stop propagation, too, actually
U3YDBDP4Z : `onSubmit` doesn't
U2M39B7TM : One question. How I can decode a union type with decode.pipeline?```
"""
{
 Click: Int
 action : Action
}
"""

type Action =
  Increment
  | Decrement

decoder : Decoder Types.Model
decoder =
    decode Types.Model
        |&gt; required "click" int
        |&gt; ???

```

U3YDBDP4Z : Okay, I'm getting an error that's not shown anywhere
U3YDBDP4Z : Expecting an object with a field named `value` at _.target but instead got: {"0":{},"1":{},"elm_handlers":{}}
U3YDBDP4Z : when Elm is creating the event handler
U3SJEDR96 : ```actionDecoder : Decoder Action
actionDecoder =
  string |&gt; andThen (\action -&gt;
    case action of
      "Increment" -&gt; succeed Increment
      "Decrement" -&gt; succeed Decrement
      _ -&gt; fail &lt;| "Failed to decode '" ++ action ++ "'"
  )
```

U3YDBDP4Z : It looks like it fails creating the message constructor
U3SJEDR96 : So what do you expect `event.target.value` to be for an `onSubmit` event? As in, what is the "value" of a `form` element?
U3YDBDP4Z : I wasn't expecting target.value to be anything, just trying to put things together.But you are on the right track, that is that it will silently fail and refresh the page if the property on `target` doesn't exist

U3YDBDP4Z : I just used the targetValue decoder as a template
U3SJEDR96 : close. Your decoder is ran, and returns a `Result String val`. If that is an Err, the event will not be handled by Elm
U3SJEDR96 : i.e. `on "submit" (fail "nah")` would have a similar effect :slightly_smiling_face:
U3YDBDP4Z : That's what I mean with a silent fail. The result was an `Err` and anything that isn't `Ok` will just do nothing.
U3YDBDP4Z : In this case, it caused a page refresh. I suspect I might have seen an error in console if the page hadn't refreshed…?
U3SJEDR96 : Nope, they're not logged; they silently fail
