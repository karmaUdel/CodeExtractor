U39DE7RQ9 : OK, thanks!
U6AU4N1HR : Hey, I'm doing Json.Decode.map5 over a JSON and creating record User. I want to add another field to that record, which is a list. The problem is, this list is not a part of JSON. I want to intiliaze record User with a empty list. Is it possible to somehow use empty list with Json.Decode.map6?
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U6AU4N1HR> The record constructor is just a regular function. You could instead go `\a b c d e -&gt; MyRecord a b c [] d e` You could also use `Json.Decode.succeed []` with the `map6`
U14Q8S4EM : You can do `succeed list`
U14Q8S4EM : `Json.Decode.succeed whateverListYouWanted`
U14Q8S4EM : Yeah what <@U48AEBJQ3> said
U6AU4N1HR : Thanks!
U6AU4N1HR : Didn't see the succeed function
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U6AU4N1HR> 
```
decodeUser : Decode.Decoder User
decodeUser =
    Decode.map5
        (\id userName firstName gender booksCount -&gt;
            User id userName firstName gender booksCount [])
        (Decode.field "id" <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
        (Decode.field "username" Decode.string)
        (Decode.field "first_name" Decode.string)
        (<http://Decode.at|Decode.at> [ "profile", "gender" ] Decode.string)
        (Decode.field "books_count" <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
```

or, if you moved that field to the top of the record:

```
decodeUser : Decode.Decoder User
decodeUser =
    Decode.map5 (User [])
        (Decode.field "id" <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
        (Decode.field "username" Decode.string)
        (Decode.field "first_name" Decode.string)
        (<http://Decode.at|Decode.at> [ "profile", "gender" ] Decode.string)
        (Decode.field "books_count" <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
```

U6AU4N1HR : <@U48AEBJQ3> ok i get it, thanks
U4RR7KX45 : ```type alias Year =
    Float


type alias Seconds =
    number


type alias Details =
    ( Year, Seconds )
```
what's wrong with this code?

U4RR7KX45 : gives me the following error```
Type alias `Seconds` must declare its use of type variable number

21|&gt;type alias Seconds =
22|&gt;    number

You probably need to change the declaration like this:

type alias Seconds number = ...

```

U6CBXFWHG : trying to setup my atom ide for elm, and I get a linter error
module Main exposing (..)

is all I have in the file, and the linter says "The system cannot find the path specified."

any ideas?

U6CBXFWHG : Im trying to follow the elm tutorial on <http://knowthen.com|knowthen.com>
U635238TG : is your file named Main.elm?
U635238TG : I had something like that happen to me when I didn't have a Main.elm for it to pull in. I'm a total newb though
U153UK3FA : <@U4RR7KX45> that's not going to work, you need to specify what type of `number` will be in that type
U6CBXFWHG : test.elm
U6CBXFWHG : just renamed it and still have the same issue
U153UK3FA : <@U4RR7KX45> `number` isn't a type so you can't alias it, it's a compiler magic typeclass 
U6CBXFWHG : I'm using windows 7 and it was already a pain to get the path for the elm-format to work, I am open to downloading a different ide, I was using vscode and gave up to try atom...
