U2D7NUGS1 : It's very good. Just takes a change of a mindset.
U153UK3FA : <@U604S603Y> are you using elm-decoder-pipeline ? That trades nicer API against good error messages
U604S603Y : yes, I am using elm-decoder-pipeline
U3LUC6SNS : Hello all!  I've transferred the entire folder containing my app from my dev machine (with inoperative keyboard) to my wife's computer.  On the latter I have installed elm, node, webpack, etc.  However, when I run `yarn start`, I get this error message:```

I've missed something, but have no idea what it is.

U3SJEDR96 : to be fair, <@U3LUC6SNS>, I didn't see an api.js when I had a look at your code last week.. I did see a `server.js` though, but that seems a mock at most
U3SJEDR96 : can you check if there _is_ an api.js on your (former) dev machine? Plugging in an external keyboard might help..
U3LUC6SNS : <@U3SJEDR96>, I'll investigate -- thanks!
U3LUC6SNS : <@U3SJEDR96>, just looked at the old app folder.  No `api.js` file there.  Interestingly enough, when I run `yarn start` there, I get a similar error message.: `Cannot find model ...koko_client/api.js` etc.  But it is much shorter.  It ends with `Killing all processs with signal null ... Exited with code 1`  But then it goes on to say `Project is running at http://...3000`
U3LUC6SNS : Hard to do much on the old machine since I can't type a space with the  incompatible keyboard.
U3LUC6SNS : server.js is an express web server.  I looked in webpack.config.js and found no `api.js`
U3LUC6SNS : Ah here it is: in `package.json`:```
"scripts": {
    "api": "node api.js",
    "build": "webpack",
    "client": "webpack-dev-server --port 3000",
    "start": "nf start"
  },
```

U3SJEDR96 : right. So your Procfile probably has a `yarn client` in there somewhere... It's a little odd that foreman decides to stop on your current machine, but continued on your older machine. I suppose you can remove the `yarn api` part of your Procfile for now..
U3LUC6SNS : <@U3SJEDR96> Commented out `api yarn api` in `Procfile`.  The error is now```

Could there be a problem with `PATH`?  It is now
```
172-10-18-240:koko_client2 carlson$ echo $PATH
/Users/carlson/Library/Haskell/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/carlson/.rvm/bin:/Users/carlson/dev/node_modules/mathjax-node/bin
```

U3SJEDR96 : it seems to expect webpack to be installed globally
U3LUC6SNS : OK, how would I do that?
U0CLDU8UB : `yarn global add webpack`
U3SJEDR96 : yarn global add webpack would probably fix that, though I do suggest trying to make sure it uses the local path
U3LUC6SNS : I'll give these suggestions a try.  Thanks <@U3SJEDR96> and <@U0CLDU8UB> Yikes
U3LUC6SNS : Yikes what a pain this is!!! I did `yarn global add webpack`, then `yarn start`  Error message is```

U3LUC6SNS : `$ which webpack` returns nothing

U3LUC6SNS : Yes
