All of these are different states that a call could be in
yes
I'm thinking `RecordingStatus` only makes sense for `Active` calls
I'd agree
I think that last type is pretty much spot on
You can think of it as "a call can be in one of N states, some of which have extra data associated (such as recording status)"

great to be able to chat through these questions
I'm glad we found a nice solution :slightly_smiling_face:
how can I decode an array of custom type with json decoder?
