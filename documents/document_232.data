U46ARQJF9 : thank you <@U0Y7H2F3M>
U3UD6RY59 : Hey botmakers!  We're having a super chill Bots + Beers meet-up tomorrow in SF and would be super cool to see some more bot faces out and building community with us! <https://www.meetup.com/Bots-and-Beer/events/238470478/>
U4HJ1HUM8 : dpg: Hey! Anyway to attend via internet?
U4HJ1HUM8 : I am a boarding school student which cannot go out conveniently. And also, my school is in Oregon, which is a little far from there. Thanks.
U3QMX2TPF : is it possible to send data with oauth link which can be obtained where the code is handled ?
U4KU7MXGT : I'm trying to use the send/receive middleware to log all conversations to a database.  I can't seem to find how to identify the user.  The message object only contains a channel (no message.user).  Any idea about what I'm missing?
U4KU7MXGT : BTW, this is happening on bot.reply
U3U7G58P6 : my method is to add message.user manually..
U38M5TH0X : Anyone have experience doing a white label service for bots? Is there an API or service that can be used to generate new Facebook Messenger bots and run through the application process or do you just have to do the good ole legwork in the Facebook developer dashboard?
U4GQR1QM7 : does anyone have experience downloading files that are uploaded to slack. - in particular with python.. When I use _requests_ and get what is under the *url_private_download* I get the file (mp3) but the metadata (sound-length) is stripped away. with _urllib2_ I find a complete html file under this url :thinking_face:
U4KP9B464 : Hi! ```
Authentication

Authenticate your Web API requests by providing a bearer token, which identifies a single user.

Register your application with Slack to obtain credentials for use with our OAuth 2.0 implementation, which allows you to negotiate tokens on behalf of users and teams. Tokens should be passed in all Web API calls as a parameter called token.
```

This is at the bottom of the authentication page. I'm trying to build an API that can make slack API method calls for the user's that call the endpoints I'm providing. Is there a way for me to register the API with the _team_ so that I can have the scoped access needed? I'd rather not store individual tokens per user if not necessary, as I'm not really storing any state.

U3U7G58P6 : hello!
U4KVBQMU0 : Hi everyone! My name is Carina and I am an UI Architect from Vienna (Austria. I'm currently doing a scientific study on chatbots and one goal of it is to over the whole bot market worldwide. On the one hand I want to collect insights the the technical side but also collect organizations and communities like this one. I would love to have your insights covered in my study. Would be a pleasure if you fill out this form &amp; also share it. Thanks a lot in advance!

U07CW6N3A : the current installation model is one where the installing user is the owner of the issued tokens, though most apps still act on a kind of team-based context.   You might want to look at using a bot user and requesting the `bot` scope, which will yield you yet another token -- a bot user token, which encodes the agency of your app a bit more clearly
U37C5V3HT : Which hosting is better for slack app in between Heroku and Beepboop if you have used any one of these!
U04SM6T2H : Beep Boop has lots of nice extras for your bot
U04SM6T2H : Heroku is just generic hosting
U37C5V3HT : I see, thanks Ben!
U1TAT1DMY : Are there any examples of current widely used bots implementing link unfurls?
U0GT29N3A : davidt: Does the native Twitter integration count?
U1TAT1DMY : Not sure. I'm just curious to see any creative uses that people come up with :slightly_smiling_face:
U04SM6T2H : not yet, that feature is super fresh :slightly_smiling_face:
U4MJ25LS2 : Hello, I'm trying to create my first Slack App and I'm wondering about linking my team slack app to our Github organization. 
The official GitHub integration have a page allowing the user installing the app to authorize Slack app in Github and then to choose the repositories and events type you want to listen to. 
Can I add something like that to my own app ?

U4M6BJ8LV : Hi all - I'm trying to make a thread with a robust websocket connection using python-slackclient. Anyone have an example of what exceptions I need to catch and how to reinitialise the slack client server when things go wrong? Unfortunately the slackclient tries to protect the caller from exceptions, so I'm not sure what things I need to handle.
U4M6BJ8LV : (this is for the RTM interface)
U4M6BJ8LV : Or will the websocket automatically reconnect as necessary behind the scenes?
U4KU7MXGT : <@U3U7G58P6> where are you doing this?  message.user is present in the .hears block.  However, after bot.reply call, it's not passed into the send middleware.
U3U7G58P6 : which bot are u using
U3U7G58P6 : facebook or slack?
U1880JCVB : What's up? What if we can have a single list of conferences and their participants in AI and chatbot space? <https://medium.com/standuply/best-ai-and-chatbot-conferences-in-2017-55f020acb782>
U4KU7MXGT : Sorry, I should have included that.  Slack
U3U7G58P6 : emm im not quite familiar with slack
U3U7G58P6 : but for facebook you can add it here```bot.reply = function(src, resp, cb) {

			var msg = {};

			if (typeof(resp) == 'string') {
				msg.text = resp;
			} else {
				msg = resp;
			}
			msg.page = src.page;
			msg.channel = src.channel;

			bot.say(msg, cb);
		};```

U0HKDKHD4 : <@U04SM6T2H>: Benji! Do you know any facebook messenger product managers? We're developing tech for banks and having some serious concerns around the *in*ability to hide admins from accessing the bot conversation logs directly through the messenger interfaces on <http://facebook.com|facebook.com>.
U04SM6T2H : <@U0HKDKHD4> oo that is an interesting problem!
U04SM6T2H : Let me see if I can find someone to talk to
U04SM6T2H : <@U4LHRBMPW> where is that happening?
U4LHRBMPW : I have a public channel called <#C4LHZ0WLA|ticktick> to test my app, which forwards incoming SMS from Twilio
U04SM6T2H : sorted :slightly_smiling_face:
