(answered in <#C1Q164V29|sql> — use `setNextException()` <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/SQLException.html#setNextException-java.sql.SQLException-> )
Seems `yesql` thinks that question mark is param placeholder and fires error.
<@U34K4458X> Could you try that same query directly with `java.jdbc` just to eliminate whether the problem is `yesql` or something else?
I've never seen a database with `?` in column names... I didn't even think it was legal.
Me neither, but have to use it :slightly_smiling_face: Tried JDBC - works fine.
In postgres it is not legal, but can be escaped with column name with quotes
OK, well, that confirms a bug in `yesql` so you should create a GitHub issue.
Seems that yesql is not actively maintained. Started evaluating hugsql instead.
Thanks anyway
Ah, right, I heard that folks are switching to HugSQL. BTW, there's a <#C1Q164V29|sql> channel that's probably best for Qs like this.
We use HoneySQL for complex queries and raw `java.jdbc` for most stuff.
Singapore Clojure Meetup tomorrow night, welcome to join. <https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Clojure-Meetup/events/240601551/>
petr: I'm not sure about docker, i only recall that that specific exception was related to ipv6 on a non-clojure project.
armed: you may be interested in my fork <https://github.com/tatut/jeesql>
<@U11SJ6Q0K> wow, thanks. I'll definitely look at your lib.
<@U4PRDUVCY> event invitations are always appreciated. But it would probably be better to limit them to one channel (<#C03RZRRMP|events> seens best)
If you are feeling particularly adventurous, you can try <https://github.com/tatut/specql>
