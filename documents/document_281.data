I understand why it's wrong, but don't know how to fix it.
Basically I would like the error case to log and do not trigger a message.
that's not possible
because both cases need to produce the same type
but, you can use `Decode.fail`
Ok?
What't the recommended way to write a cookie or write to localstorage with Elm? I need to somehow persist the access token after the user logged in. Do I have to create a port for this or is there a better/simpler way?
`, Json.Decode.fail (Debug.log "Wrong event" "")` should work I think
<@U5FC7BE0G> ports are the way to go
k, thanks!
<@U1CE9DL9H> yes it does. Thank you.
Any way to access the reason for failure?
It would be nice to print it as well.
The reason for failure is the string you give to Decode.fail
When you as a developer are telling the Decoder that this case should fail, you should know why. :)
Silly question but how do you define an incoming port with no arguments?
`port flyoutResetLights : (Bool -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg`
`port flyoutResetLights :  Sub msg`
but of course that doesn't work
`port name : () -&gt; Cmd msg`
I am trying out a custom defined infix operator but it does not seem to be working :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U3KSN5MAL>, you'd do `(() -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg` i suppose
syntax help please.  I have a function.
asJsonValue model =
Json.Encode.object
[ ("theJunk" (Json.Encode.string "junk")) ]
compiler tells me there is no Json.Encode.string
<@U62PAUTV3> you can only use certain symbol characters as operators
<@U4872964V>  bizarre but seems to work!
thanks
I see, thank you. Didn't seem to find a lot of documentation on that one.
wait no
