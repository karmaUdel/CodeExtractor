Ah, too bad I can't make it there, I'd have loved to see that :slightly_smiling_face:
I hope it will be recorded.
You may take a look at <https://github.com/lzrski/elm-polymer/tree/pre-publish>
It's work in progress. Unpublished and very poorly documented.
What I'm trying to do now is reimplement the scaffolding script in Elm. It's getting too hairy for shell scripting.

If it's recorded, please share (I also speak Dutch)
