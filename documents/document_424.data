U0FP80EKB : maybe so you can work with different versions on different projects?
U5QJW0DDE : different versions of the elm language?
U0FP80EKB : yeah
U5QJW0DDE : oh ok
U0FP80EKB : maybe? I haven't read that page, though. ¯\_(?)_/¯
U5QJW0DDE : he made that statement but did not provide a reason why
U5QJW0DDE : do i understand correctly that the only place you'd write a type variable would be in the declaration of a union or record, but nowhere else?
U14Q8S4EM : Not sure what that measn <@U5QJW0DDE>
U14Q8S4EM : I write them in case statements all the time
U14Q8S4EM : Like
U14Q8S4EM : ```handle : Maybe Int -&gt; Int
handle maybeInt =
    case maybeInt of
        Just int -&gt;
            int + 5
        Nothing -&gt;
            20
```

U14Q8S4EM : But maybe thats not what you meant.
U5QJW0DDE : i don't see a type varaible in your case statement
U5QJW0DDE : The "Int" in "Maybe Int" is a type given to the type variable declared in Maybe
U14Q8S4EM : ``` handle : Maybe Int -&gt; Int
handle maybeInt =
    case maybeInt of
        Just 5 -&gt;
            12
        everythingElse -&gt;
            20
```

U5QJW0DDE : types are capitalized, your Just int uses "int" as a regular variable
U14Q8S4EM : By type variable, you mean a lower case word like used in the type signature?
U5QJW0DDE : yeah
U5QJW0DDE : all variables are lowercase; if used in a signature, that variable is a type variable; if used in a definition, it's a regular variable, holding data
U14Q8S4EM : Yeah, in that case I can think of 0 declaring a variable, 1 specifying the type signature, and 2 that case statement stuff
U14Q8S4EM : Or also```
handle : Model -&gt; CustomType
handle { customType } =
```

U5QJW0DDE : you can't use type variables in a case, at least not that I've ever seen
U5QJW0DDE : your case example is not using type variables
U14Q8S4EM : In my second case example I use `everythingElse`?
