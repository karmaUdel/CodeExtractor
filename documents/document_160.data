```
<@U16RPN2UC>, this would probably count as a mention, because your username is linked
harvey, while this might not, depending on how botkit is implemented
yeah, I assume it's a botkit thing. I'll see what I can see in the source.
ahh, it might be looking for an `@torgo`
yep, that's it
also: hi nolan, if you're the nolan I know. otherwise, ignore me nolan!
Has anyone done the maths on what happens if everyone who's writing a bot spams everyone in the channel with a direct message?
<@U0J283T6E>: what maths?
Hi all, myself and a few buddies of mine just built a tool for collecting feedback on our bots. It is called Feedbot. I'd love some feedback, as what we have built thus far is still pretty basic. It is super simple: underneath each bot response, there is a small thumbs up or thumbs down. Link to documentation here: <https://github.com/feedbot/code-samples>
I just got a dm from <@U16PUMPQT>, seemed a tad spammy
sounds like good feedback for that bot team!
spambots will be ruthlessly banished :simple_smile:
Hey, guys, for us webbot/botkit noobs, I created  a short, 10-minute ish video, as a reply to <@U04SM6T2H>  's  request/favor to look it over from a noob standpoint.  The vid's just on how easy and quick it is to build a bot with botkit: <http://bit.ly/1WPmyB7>
Btw, that's our family dog, Professor --&gt; slack bot I whipped up for the vid is called professor_bot--actually professor_bot2, due to tech difficulties :stuck_out_tongue:
Hey Guys ,Can anyone help me understand how to get username from slack message received in botkit?  I am receiving the message but message.user is undefined. What am i doing wrong?
hey fellas! anyone has a good Sketch kit to design Slack interaction mockups? like this one the extraordinary Meekan are using : <https://twitter.com/meekanWorld>
random question: is there a configuration setting preventing bots from joining certain channels one of our customers is having trouble inviting the bot the the <#C04SM6TAK> channel, its the only channel they cant invite it to. I've been looking and havent found any settings that seem like they would prevent the bot from joining a channel.
<@U0RRCPDK9>: it's photoshop… want it?
<@U055FHACC> i would like that
it's a bit dated, almost from a year ago. Slack changed a little  since then, but it get's the message thru. Enjoy..
New post on why we designed Kip to connect across platforms :simple_smile: <https://medium.com/chat-bots/why-the-future-of-bots-will-be-multi-platform-67c503afaa7#.oy3rhrd7g>
I'm not sure what *bulk changes* are?
heh. thanks <@U055FHACC> :simple_smile: you rock dude.
<@U14TYLC94>: typically, `im_history_changed` is triggered by a team admin performing a bulk import of message data (from another service or a Slack export)
<@U07CW6N3A>: I see. I'm trying to get the history of an IM. I've pasted a fairly large amount of text multiple times but it does not trigger.
<@U14TYLC94>: I don't think there's a threshold-based way to trigger it from what I can tell; it's an event sent more explicitly by back-end code when a particular code path is executed that warrants it.
Gotcha. I'm probably going to run a CRON job to get that then. ( the API doc is not very clear...)
thanks
we are (counting bots) more than 2k!
This never appears to fire for me.  I've done something similar to capture the `reaction_added` event and that works fine.  Anyone have any advice here?
Hey folks. Does anyone know if there are any typings for using Botkit with TypeScript?
<@U17BPUG1W>: Try asking in <#C0AV5N8NA>.
<@U17BEF4UR>: You should also ask your quesiton in <#C0AV5N8NA>. :simple_smile: (At least that code looks like botkit to me.)
Meh. When posting a message with multibyte chars in username, Slack will truncate at 50 bytes and can cut in a middle of a char. Then postMessage returns `EMPTY_JSON`
hey folks, i've been working on a "mixpanel for bots" that lets you collect &amp; analyze metrics for your bot with very little code: <https://www.getbotmetrics.com>
been using it in production with my bot <http://asknestor.me|asknestor.me> for the last 10 days
here's what the dashboard looks like (real data)
dude, should've said a week ago :smile:
and there's a ruby &amp; node client <https://github.com/botmetrics/botmetrics-rb>
<https://github.com/botmetrics/botmetrics.js>
just a single line of code to start collecting metrics :smile: let me know if u need help setting it up
<@U0ND8KMFG>: ah did u set an analytics system up already?
yeap, something simple with google analytics
are you planing on adding other platforms as well ? FB etc.
yup
happy to help u set up botmetrics for ur project, super simple to do
doing another bot at the moment and will give it a try when I have time to do so :simple_smile:
glad someone created such a tool :simple_smile:
:+1:
there's lot more stuff
u can find out which teams are using ur bot the most
and so on and so forth
hello! we have thing for you all: <https://twitter.com/SlackAPI/status/730081277353721856>
<https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/introducing-sign-in-with-slack-290949e1c3f5#.w03sjzz05>
and, in anticipation of the discussions in this team: <https://medium.com/@ernesto_jimenez/new-sign-in-with-slack-button-dfd570043a77> :simple_smile:
there you have some tips to integrate SIWs and some caveats about confusing parts of the API so you are aware in case it can save you from some headaches
good post <@U0CS6NSF5> , I thought the info returned by the API calls was lacking consistency (user.profile.email vs user.email, team_id vs team.id, and so on)
great job <@U04S1QCPC> and team, it will be super useful
(thank you <@U0CS6NSF5>!)
thanks :simple_smile:
<@U0CS6NSF5>: those caveats, ouch
(i've created <#C17MZ7UTF> for answering questions/feedback related to sign in with slack (siws))
The connection between Quip and slack teams is a bit confusing, I was able to sign into quip with a slack team, and it showed my gmail contacts in Quip instead of those teammates
The slack side doesn't work unless you define a company email address
That screenshot was from this link: <https://quip.com/-/slack/app?send-welcome-message=1>
Is anybody on here using Keen from AWS US East? Write queries are super slow and Keen support says that there is a "mysterious network issue" with people hosting in this region.
<@U0GPKTHQ9>: we're in US East (Not using Keen) and seeing write ops at 275/sec. Not sure if that helps or not
Hi all
<@U0GPKTHQ9>: do you if Keen and your app are in the same AWS availability zone?
<@U0YQS1FAR> wait, so 275 write operations per second with slack?
<@U17PZH8R3>: Hello :wave:
Sorry <@U0GPKTHQ9>  didn't realize you were talking in the context of slack
<@U0GT29N3A>: No idea where they are running their stuff, but they told me that they have some customers experiencing slow write operations and those customers are all within the AWS US East zone. But they have no idea what the problem can be
<@U0YQS1FAR>: haha, well in the context of keen :stuck_out_tongue: (not necessarily :slack: )
<@U0GPKTHQ9>: Maybe you can check that then. Once I had an EC2 instance and an RDS instance in the same region, but different availability zones and it was slow (my fault, ofc).
<@U0GT29N3A>: my stuff is all on heroku haha
but the kind of speeds i am seeing is far beyond availability zone latency
quickest write query was 600ms, longest one was 15 000ms
please ignore holly

Question , I have granted oauth acess to channels:history
however when I try to access the  api with botacess token i am getting a scope error
any insights?
Can you post the error?
Those scopes apply to the users oauth token, not the bots
}
How do you give a bot access to history
my slackbutton has the channels:history scope
and I see in the bot config that it does have the permission
Post messages to 1 channe
Think I found a solution
will try it before it post it
Hi, any web developers in the UK?
<@U17UY798W>: sure, there's a <#C0HLEF9NZ> channel too
<@U0CS6NSF5>: thanks:)
anytime :simple_smile:
As always your support and feedback is priceless :heart:
Is it possible to let Guest users (multi + single channel users) sign into an integration?
Is there a way to put an inline image in the message text (NOT attachment)?
    at Timer.listOnTimeout (timers.js:198:5)
Are you connected to the RTM API?
There's also a <#C0AV5N8NA> channel for botkit specific questions. Just fyi
Whoops! I didn't even check :disappointed: my bad
<@U0HRQBPE1>: guest accounts cannot use "add to slack" anymore (they used to be able to)
I have not tried "sign in with Slack"
Let me try signing in to Slackline with a guest account
No, they can't use SIWS either
What are are you doing as a work around for Slackline? Just a good ol' fashion “sign up with email?"
Or just avoiding teams that use restricted accounts would work too I guess.
We don't do anything to work around it right now
If that's annoying, people can bring it up with Slack :)
It's not a huge deal right now… we just had a customer unexpectedly using guest Slack accounts and none of those users could sign in.
<@U0HRQBPE1>: in my opinion, SIWS should be available for guests, maybe without the `identity.team` scope, but having it 100% disabled will hurt some use cases. But there's other issues regarding permissions that are more important from my point of view
Bots being able to access a channel's history, which is important for reliability and missing
Bots able to leave channels, which is related to a bug they had (I don't know if it's fixed yet) where you can have inaccessible private channels
Bots being able to create private channels and invite users, which means for some use cases you need to ask for `groups:read` scopes
Etc.
<@U0HPNTZ8Q>: good luck getting with that one... XD it's more feasible to get access to that with a user's token
Rather than a bot
Given that bots don't even have access to historical data at all
yeah, I know... one can still hope though
On the other hand, if you get the right permissions you can search for the data yourself
one of the things I wanted to do would have been trivial with a search using `in:`, `has:link` and `on:` modifiers
You can always keep track of that yourself
now I'm logging messages with links myself.... yeah, that :wink:
Hello! I  was wondering if bots can delete other users messages
<@U1887F325>: nope
Where do you guys host your bots?
<@U10HKRTAA>: heroku, AWS and digital ocean are the most popular (not necessarily in that order)
<@U0CS6NSF5>: thanks for the input :thumbsup:
:+1:
We host on Heroku (just because our existing app is there). Would probably do it on AWS if not
Heroku
Anyone using BeepBoop?
I only used once Heroku and it was for some slash commands... to use a add to Slack button in Heroku, if you have 3k teams, how that works? you have what in Heroku? 1 server with a lot of virtual processors?
<@U1887F325>, <@U0CS6NSF5> : I think yes, with the `chat:write:user` scope
<@U0ZNF2Q9J>: that's with a user token, not a bot token
and you will only be able to delete the messages that user is able to delete
yep, but <@U1887F325> might want to do just that :stuck_out_tongue:
if you are in a one on one conversation with a both and you want to clear the history of the conversation for example
<@U0ZNF2Q9J>: that's not the bot deleting other user's messages, it's the authed user deleting messages, and if the user is not an admin it will only be able to delete it's messages anyway :simple_smile:
in that DM, you would only be able to delete the history if you have a token with that permission with the user your bot is talking with
ohhhhhhh, that was not what I understand from the doc, but now it's clear
<@U0ZNF2Q9J>: that's why there's a `cant_delete_message` error in `chat.delete`, because it depends on the permissions of the user
also, some teams might have disabled deleting messages entirely in their settings
did anyone used botbuilder from MS? it seems if I understood that takes care of all the RTMs, so you just need a REST API...
<@U11FSNKL0>: BotBuilder looks interesting.
indeed... but is in preview... thats why I wanted to know if anyone is using it...
I may check it out... I need to reduce the memory usage for my app, it looks like this could potentially help.
<@U181JHTL1>: please let us know if it worked!
I'd love to know how others are scaling their apps. Maybe there's a #app-scaling channel?
I've wondered that too <@U181JHTL1>. Our bot is connected to ~300 teams and I haven't seen any performance issues thus far but we aren't pushing that much data. I created a branch to play with deploying the bot across multiple dynos when the time comes.
<@U0YQS1FAR>: what's your stack?
Node.js on the server and Angular.js on the client. Using PostgreSQL, Redis, and <http://Socket.io|Socket.io>. Hosted on heroku
and <#C0AV5N8NA>!
<@U0YQS1FAR>: you mentioned having one bot process that connects to 300 teams. Do you have any info on how much memory that uses?
Not that much. I'll post a pic
<@U0YQS1FAR>: that's for 300 teams?
yeah. Actually it's 380. Hadn't checked in a while.
<@U0YQS1FAR>: thanks for sharing.  out of curiosity, how is the CPU?
we use roughly the same amount of memory per process but host 3x that amount of teams per process
using Go
That's interesting <@U0CS6NSF5>
<@U17BEF4UR> the dyno load isn't bad
<@U0YQS1FAR>: thanks for sharing. My app hovers a little over 700MB and continues to rise as new teams are added.
Seems really high and not sustainable to me
<@U181JHTL1>: you will have to start sharding your connections
how many teams <@U181JHTL1>
1000+
also, there's the thing that clients usually cache all the team's details (all users, channels, etc.), and some bots don't need to keep track of all that information so it's basically wasting memory
I just cache the bot instances themselves fwiw
<@U0YQS1FAR>: if you are using botkit, I'm guessing the package is keeping all the users, profiles, channels, bots, etc. in memory
<@U0YQS1FAR>: could you point me to docs on caching the instances? By caching rtm is still open, right?
<@U0CS6NSF5> it may be internally. I haven't looked honestly.
<@U181JHTL1>: I just meant I save a reference to the bot that is connected to the rtm. I'll DM you the snippet
Cool, thanks!
<@U0CS6NSF5>: I just saw that. I don't need to save that info to memory. Thanks for the tip!
Those memory/bot stats are interesting :slightly_smiling_face:

Does anyone know how you can listen to a github/bitbucket integration with botkit? I tried mutliple things, but it didn't work.
<@U18KXLWG0>: listen to messages from integrations?
<@U0CS6NSF5>:  Yes, I'm trying that now, but I thought there would maybe be a nicer way using `hears`.
I believe botkit ignores messages from integrations by default
It's possible but you have to listen to bot_message events
just confirming, there's no way to download the archive via the api?
<@U0H9CA2MS>: nope, unless there's an undocumented method to do so
Hello everyone, curious about capabilities with bots and direct message replies, I've got a bot I'm working on that sends direct messages to users, and I'm trying to see if it's possible to include a link in the message that would send a DM back to the bot to trigger some other command. Trying to do something similar to the built-in reminders feature in slackbot where you can click “snooze” or “cancel” or “done” in a reminder DM'd to you from slackbot. Maybe I'm missing something obvious but don't see that documented in chat.postMessage or anywhere else. Thanks!
Hello, Can botkit return a list of users in a direct convo? IE. I have a DM with 3 people, 2 human, and the bot, if someone triggers the bot by saying “hi” or whatever, can I see the list of all the users in the convo? `message` only returns the person that initialized the convo via `user`
}
I would like to get something like this
}
I assume the `channel` starts with a `G` in this case?
If so, I think you want something like `<http://bot.api.groups.info|bot.api.groups.info>({ channel: message.channel }, function (err, info) { console.log(info.group.members); });`
But oops, <#C0AV5N8NA> is the right channel for this question.
yes, it starts with a “G"
oh, sorry didnt see it in the channels, will do so for the future
so i would pass in the channel id and get a return of the channel?
well check that out, Thanks <@U11C8V57T>
<@U18PEALTH>: Yup. See <https://api.slack.com/methods/groups.info>.
<@U18PEALTH>: There's Markdown support in here: 3 backticks for multiline code, single one for inline formatting.
<@U0YQS1FAR> looks legit for node-based. The spikes could be at heroku server restart ? I see similar spikes
Thanks <@U0HBN0L9M>. I think the spikes are when I'm firing off a bunch of messages at once
Does anyone here happen to use taskwarrior? Or <http://inthe.am|inthe.am>?
<@U0HPNTZ8Q>: no, but from a quick looks at the taskwarrior docs, you will need some other server in front to map some endpoints to actual taskwarrior server commands.
Yeah, I know, that's what <http://inthe.am|inthe.am> does :smiley:
I was looking for someone with an account who might be willing to try the bot I'm working on
Nice new warning about Bot tokens on Slack's bot configuration page
good job <@U04S1QCPC> <@U04SS2NBF> <@U0F7LRC5A>
Hey everyone. Are there any official statements from slack specifying demographics and stats about the product?
<http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/slack-statistics/>
Does anyone know of a good tool for creating dialogue trees? Twine is great, but ideally I'd like something that is collaborative like Google Docs.
<@U0RRCPDK9> why don't you build one for us?
Guess that'll have to be our next project! :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U055FHACC> what are you guys using for meekan?
Build dialogue trees + something that picks the best answer for every situation (one that seems to evoke good sentiment in the answers + doesn't repeat itself. Kinda like a constant a/b tester for bot responses)
+ support for multi languages
+ hot-deploys (what's the dev speak for that? I mean the minute I change some words in the dialogues, the robot picks it up, w/out needing to reboot or recompile etc)
that'd be a cool tool
drop whatever you're doing and start working on that!
Wait till you see Yala, Matty :slightly_smiling_face:
I'm holding my breath for two month already :fire:
Hello all, we are doing a private beta our a finance bot. If you wouldn't mind going through the onboarding it would be much appreciated, dm me for an invite.
Hello Guys. I just want to ask if the resultant access token given by the "sign in with slack" can be used for method <http://users.info|users.info>?
no
you have to call a different method
<https://api.slack.com/methods/users.identity>
<@U0TGHKPEU>: you can use it to access `<http://users.info|users.info>` if the user goes through the OAuth process again to grant you access to the extra scopes required to access that method
hmm ok thank you another question, can i request scope identity.basic,identity.team with users.read scope for sign in with slack?
rather than doing it on the same authorisation flow
not in one shot I think ?
you need to do it with two different authorisations
at least it's not supposed to be done this way
yes, like <@U0CS6NSF5> said
<@U0TGHKPEU>: you got some info in <https://medium.com/@ernesto_jimenez/new-sign-in-with-slack-button-dfd570043a77>
tips #4 and #5
basically, app scopes are to install the app to the Slack team. SIWS scope are just to confirm a user is part of a team, and show her relevant data
I think mixing the two is not a great practice
hmm thank you for confirming <@U0CS6NSF5> <@U0HBN0L9M> , i really need the is_admin/is_owner data for user during sign in
ah ok
it makes more sense
then I guess, it's an aspect of SIWS lacking - looping in <@U0D7LHNTX>
that could be an additional SIWS scope - identify.is_admin
or something
it will be helpful if it can
identity.is_admin sorry
still - if you app already has a bot token, for example, you could use it to query <http://users.info|users.info>
instead of the SIWS token
oh thats it , thank you,
<@U0HBN0L9M>: Thanks for the heads up! I'll see about adding that to the next release of SIWS!
:two: I need to be able to schedule different types of content for Twitter and Facebook. Sorry!
But really you should always format it differently for both media forms (and others)
<@U0K7Y2SK0>: Would you say that's :five:? :smile:
I give up.
ha
<@U0RRCPDK9>: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOrgLj9lOwk>
Popculture reference.
:wink:
thanks for your feedback <@U0K7Y2SK0>
:heart:
Yeah. I mean I can see why you'd want to push the same message, it's easy and fast, but it hurts engagement.
Each form of social media has their own communication patterns that work better for the audiences - nevermind the char limits.
<https://medium.com/on-the-same-page-with-kifi/what-we-know-in-the-shadows-5da49905fe2d>
<@U0K176R8A>: excellent writeup. Ill be encouraging my network to have a read.
Thanks for sharing.
Does anyone have experience with Sequelize and associations? I'm trying to get instance.getAssociatedObjects() to work but it doesn't seem that the method exists (figured it's a magic method implemented from the naming scheme with Sequelize)
We use sequalize, but I'm far from an expert. Post some code and I'll see if anything clicks
Have definitely never seen a `getAssociatedObjects()` method though
I was using that as a generalized example
<http://pastebin.com/Trsbct4u>
&gt; Unhandled rejection TypeError: auc.getClaims is not a function
hi, nice to meet you~
ha.
It seems the magic "addUser" works fine, but not the "getClaims"
Maybe I just need to go with a more rough approach instead of trying to use the magic associations, but I figured if they were there to make life easier, I would give them a try
Maybe because you're tying to call a method that's through model? I haven't done much with the built in associations.
Ended up implementing my own instance method
I'm fairly new to sequelize so if there's something I could be doing more efficient please let me know :slightly_smiling_face:
Hi, anyone here?
:wave:
if you do happen to have a question, feel free to ask away though
if anyone sees it who can chip in, they probably will haha
<@U19J7PF7T>: hey there. yeah! almost 2000 folks :wink:
I think beside from the identity admin/owner i think it will be best if the slack team can add identity for detrmining restricted / guest account for SIWS :+1:

Supports/will support : Google search, weather, maps, urban dict, gifs, google image search, Calculations, Wolframalpha engine,   youtube and many other websites :) 
Anyone here use botkit? I decided to create a bot with it and am having a hell of a time getting it working with slack. I was able to get it going on facebook messenger no problem.
<@U196ZMU3Y> why don't you try and come share your problem at the channel <#C0AV5N8NA> ? you'll probably find help faster there! :slightly_smiling_face:
Anyone here have experience with <https://github.com/os/slacker> ? Posting message ceased to work and has the error channel not found. Anyone came across this issue?
Oh nvm just got it

Let's chat! 
Are you in the DC area? Come say hi in the <#C1A70GFME> channel.
by changing channel names. The channels are getting created but purpose is not set. Here is docs link: <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.create> What am I doing wrong?
<@U1621CQ95>: do you see the "purpose" parameter in `channels.create`?
You need to use `channels.setPurpose` and `channels.setTopic`, but I'm afraid this is not available for bot users: you'll need to use a user token with the `channels:write` scope for that.
<@U0GT29N3A>: thanks for reply. Does that mean `channels.setPurpose` should be called after creation of channel?
<@U1621CQ95>: yes, it's a different method, you can only call it after creating the channel (since you need the channel id)
Hello, I am trying to make a slack bot. In a DM I want to tell the bot to send a DM to everyone that is in a specific channel. I figured out the channel ID and how to send a message to that channel from my DM.  How do I retrieve all the user ID's in that channel with just knowing all the channel IDs? I would hate to have to hardcode all the user ID
<@U1A8P67HU>: <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.info> or <https://api.slack.com/methods/groups.info> if it's a “group” (private channel).
Howdy y'all! If you're thinking about attending SIGNAL 2016 (<https://www.twilio.com/signal>) but haven't registered yet, we've got a promo code for you! Use  `SLACK35` to save 35% off the regular rate. the SlackAPI team will be there, and we've got an entire bot session full of awesome talks—we hope to see you there too!
Has anyone (using BotKit) experienced bots randomly dying? Only some of them die and it doesn't happen at any regular interval — perhaps something to do with websockets' connections unexpectedly closing?
totes…it happens to Howdy sometimes
random websockets close from Slack side occasionally
strangely, yesterday i couldnt start my bot with forever (got SIGKILL message), but when I ran it without forever it worked fine; really strange¯\_(?)_/¯
<@U04S3JCH2>: ooh got it. How do you guys handle it — is there a way to be notified so you can just restart the bot?
yeah…our QA guy keeps a close eye on things and then will restart the bots whenever it happens
it's a bummer because that often happens mid-interaction for a lot of folks
makes for a bad experience :confused:
:confused: dang.
We use forever to restart the bot if it dies
does it happen often? we moved from heroku —&gt; aws a week ago and noticed it happened twice so far, so just trying to see if it's the websocket or something with the server configs
<@U0YQS1FAR>: gtk thanks!
I too have this problem. I'm looking for a way to auto-restart when they go offline.
What worries me is that I only know about offline bots by the people asking me about their bots, which might not be a good way to measure how many are actually offline.
I need some kind of monitor
Related - if the Slack API is down, users have no idea if your bot is down or if it is a slack problem
<@U181JHTL1>: yeah, same here — we only noticed when we saw our instance was down
It just appears to them that your bot is unresponsive
ah good point pete
<@U0554MQJB>: not only that, but some issues are never reported in Slack's status page
right, calls randomly fail
Hey all, I'm in the process of developing a task delegation bot using botkit and firebase (to store the tasks). I want multiple teams to be able to integrate the bot into their slack chats and I want each task to be stored under a different child node in firebase based on the URL of each slack team.  I've been attempting to use slack-node to get the URL of each specific team. I want to get the URL in order to configure firebase but since obtaining the URL involves using a callback function, firebase is always configured before I can get the URL and when I attempt to store a task, the URL comes up as undefined. Is there a way to get the URL before firebase is configured/any other way around this?
Anyone else notice named link formatting in bot messages is broken on iOS in the latest slack app release?
hello guys!.. If a user slack account is deactivated/disabled , does the access_token will also be disabled/invalid?
<@U0TGHKPEU>: yes
the user token will be disabled, if another user from that same team had installed your bot the bot token will stay active and the user token will get disabled
supposed user A installed bot to their team and user A has been disabled so the bot token will also disable? <@U0CS6NSF5>
last time I checked, yes
oh that would be bad then if the app require only one setup for the whole team
you need to work out a way to recover from that, yes
oh thanks for confirming <@U0CS6NSF5> :+1:
anytime
Is there a way to check if someone has a read message from our bot? We are trying to run some analytics on what messages get read vs. ignored
there isn't, as of now you cant get read/unread status from anything that isn't your own slack client
I know you can check the ‘last read' timestamp using `<http://channels.info|channels.info>` and `<http://groups.info|groups.info>` but is there a way to see it in a Direct Message convo? (if the direct message with our bot)
ah got it thanks <@U0GQ2JCCA>
I can see the bot in the list of users but the ids don't match
hmm, seems digging a little deeper the `User` for the bot provides the matching `bot_id` at `user.profile.bot_id`
Too much time passes between the individual steps, and it doesn't wait long enough at the end to show me what's happened.
re: the gif
thanks <@U0HUTFBHS>! that's exactly the kind of feedback I was looking for :smile:
Sure thing!
<@U04SM6T2H> your slack wiki idea is amazing,  looks like tettra is releasing an implementation, did you collaborate to get it into the world? any chance to release a different pricing model?
Hey guys I was wondering if anyone has a good bot for managing team members yet?
When you say “manage”, what do you mean?
like invite/kick people from the team
Unless I'm missing something, I don't see the api having that ability.
Hello guys.. Is there a way to check if a token has granted a particular scope? How about checking if a token is not disabled by the owner or the token has been disabled along with the user slack account?
the method auth.test should do the trick
Oh thanks <@U0HBN0L9M>, how about getting all granted scope of a token?
} since the auth.test return something like this but no scope indicated
I thought it'd have the scopes...
sorry
<@U0TGHKPEU>: Scopes can be read from the headers
<@U0GT29N3A>:  thanks but when should i do that ? should i parse the response of the header  after the request sent or before i sent the request?
<@U0TGHKPEU>: the scope will be in the response headers then
ok tnx <@U0KECURAT> , im trying to use curl to get the header response seems working.. thank guys
wow, slack API is under pressure no?
or it's only me
we have tons of cloudfront answer
<@U0JAVM98A>: us too. RTM errors though
k: ok, for us it's mainly api call
We had lots of 504 timeout errors, but it's good now
Yeah, I think we got RTM errors because the bot kept disconnecting due to another error and retrying the connection. I guess we mostly just got ratelimited
504 rulez
<https://status.slack.com/>  Connectivity issues for some teams
Did slack remove the timezone info from the user object? It doesn;t seem to be on <https://api.slack.com/types/user>
i don't see it there, but i do see it on a request (i used `<http://users.info|users.info>`)
