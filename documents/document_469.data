```
pretty simple. So the elm-app just checks on startup (when the browser loads the elm-app) where it is. That sets the flag which is loaded into the model on my model initialization
But I think this is completely independent of which deployment process you use. The decision which endpoint the api should connect to is done during runtime of the elm app… so to say…
