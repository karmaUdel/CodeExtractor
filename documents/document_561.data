                |&gt; Array.append array```
<@U1ZFF0E5P>: the current implementation of Array in Core has some issues
oh
it’s kind of broken, the next Elm release will include a rewrite
you can use that version now by using <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Skinney/elm-array-exploration/latest>
should I still add this to an existing github issue or just ignore it
try using `Skinney/elm-array-exploration` and see if it solves your problem
ok that fixed it, thanks <@U153UK3FA>
got really confused there for a bit lol
yeah, it’s been broken for a while, it’s tripped up a few people
just out of interest, it's the native implementation in js that has bugs?
yep
Yep, lots of JS in that Array module
It’s now only 150 lines of JS rather than the 1000 lines it was.
<@U0FP80EKB> <@U23SA861Y> what was the question?
There was a string permutation problem that was popping the stack even though it didn't explictly use recursion, only maps
we couldn't figure out where it was recursing so deep as to pop the stack
<https://ellie-app.com/3FY8YRHcqvka1/1> this one
it seemed like when the list was approaching 6k or so it was causing the issues
and an early riser I see
It's because your model is too big for the debugger to play nicely
he, so it is the debugger causing issues, interesting
The debugger uses a bunch of customized thing for the virtual-dom in order to display things usefully
If you disable the debugger, or just compile it locally, then your file works
<https://github.com/elm-lang/virtual-dom/blob/master/src/VirtualDom/Expando.elm#L130>
this function does not seem to be TCO'd.
that'll do it
