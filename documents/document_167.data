hello <@U1QFMDJUX> , perhaps you can try channel <#C0J61PA31> ? what language are you familiar with?
thx, will check it out. I'm familiar with javascript.
so botkit should be a smooth ride :slightly_smiling_face:
I made a demo app here
<https://github.com/mvaragnat/botkit-messenger-express-demo>
should get you to helloworld quickly
thank you very much, I'll check it out
I just read that quick tutorial to get started <https://medium.com/@katyemoe/making-custom-slack-slash-commands-with-hook-io-93ba70daf681#.wzy15ihve>
:+1:
so with botkit, can I create something similar to lunchtrain?
<http://lunchtrainbot.com|lunchtrainbot.com>
<@U1QFMDJUX> I'd say there's a good chance that lunchtrain itself was built with botkit
sweet
If you're interested please get in touch via Slack
Hey all, my bot can't seem to pickup the `manual_presence_change` event. Is this non-bot only functionality?
