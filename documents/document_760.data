U4872964V : no problem :slightly_smiling_face:
U16AT5E7L : New beta for my hangman game :grimacing:code - <https://github.com/puemos/elm-hangman>
demo - <http://puemos.github.io/elm-hangman/>
:elm:  :tada:

U2SR9DL7Q : <@U16AT5E7L> I won! (Really though, great stuff)
U5GPN1UPR : Bit off topic, but has anyone here got team building ideas for Devs.
U3L8MM10T : Is there a way to call an Elm function given the function name as a `String`?
U4872964V : <@U3L8MM10T> from Elm, no
U4872964V : why would you want to do that?
U3FJSB596 : If the functions is of the same type, then you can make a dictionary with a string as key and the function as its value
U4872964V : I guess if you have a dynamic enough type of model, I’ve only done that using union types though, not strings.
U4872964V : (with toString because of Dict comparable req, but … :)
U3L8MM10T : <@U4872964V> I am using  <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justgage/tachyons-elm/latest>, as well as <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-graphics/latest>, and I only want to use the Tachyons colors for consistency (<http://tachyons.io/docs/themes/skins/>).  But I don't want code duplication such as `Tachyons.Classes.purple` for the html, and `tColor__purple` for the elm-graphics: ```tHexString__purple = "#5E2CA5"
tHexToColor : String -&gt; Color
tHexToColor hex =
    Result.withDefault black &lt;| Color.Convert.hexToColor hex

tColor__purple : Color
tColor__purple =
    tHexToColor tHexString__purple```  I want to take the string `"purple"` and use that directly for the Tachyons, and then for the graphics prepend with `"tColor__"`, and then call programatically. This way the colors are synched automatically.

U4872964V : <@U3L8MM10T> I see, then a Dict is probably the best
U4872964V : or, since they are just class strings, use the `class` attribute directly.
U3L8MM10T : I don't follow how `Dict` helps.
U4872964V : You’d put the functions that you want to call in a dict, like this:```
Dict.fromList [(“purple”, tColor__purple), ...]
```

U3L8MM10T : Ok yes, it's a compromise of sorts.
U4872964V : but, you have the tHexToColor already, so why not just use that?
U4872964V : just a dict of `[(“purple”, “#5E2CA5")]` i mean
U3L8MM10T : very cool. Thanks
U4872964V : or a function, with pattern matching for the colors
U4872964V : there are a few ways
U3L8MM10T : Calling functions programatically opens up a can of worms...
U60SXAF96 : It'd be nice if elm-graphics would provide a Dict for you.
U60SXAF96 : Then  you could map over that Dict to get the Tachyon values.
