<@U4FSUJLLU> try "npm add botkit"  or "npm install" if already referenced in package.json
<@U4QCW0MPZ> by 'botkit' in the require does it refer to the howdy's botkit or just a module of it ?
gilles.mailclark: Did you find documentation somewhere on this error? We are now seeing it too.
Can anyone share live examples of slack interactive buttons that cal from external url? 
<@U4QCW0MPZ> no add option .. and install doesn't solve the problem
You probably need to reauth after the migration. 
<@U4FSUJLLU> this error means that the botkit node module is not installed. Just install it with the npm add command.
How's everyone's weekend going so far? anyone working today? :nerd_face::heart_eyes:
need some help. Can you tell me why `team_join` gives the following error wherein `user_channel_join` works 100% error free. This is the error for `team_join` _TypeError: Cannot read property 'say' of undefined_
Okay, another question. How can I validate if my current channel is <#C04SM6TAK|general> ? In botkit. 
You can check for is_general: true and record the channel id somewhere to check against
Thanks <@U4FK1HA49> let me try this out!
Btw, we currently still have the error. It seems that migration could be very long. 
The migration has ended. The bot is reconnected. :rocket:
<@U0V93GE5R> and we didn't need to re-auth :wink:
Cool so it was some weird in-progress issue from the migration, or support fixed you?
Basically we can't connect to the websocket while the team is being migrated
Is there an absolute beginner room?
<#C0J61PA31|botkit-basics> is one

<@U0V93GE5R> thank you.
I would suggest you start with a Botkit starter kit, its super straightforward too!
<https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack>   this?
yep!
Thanks again.  If I only knew what I was looking at. LoL
If you're not familiar with Rasa, it's a drop in replacement for LUIS, <http://wit.ai|wit.ai> and <http://api.ai|api.ai>. We've been using it for our bots for sometime and love it!
hey there everybody
I have built a functional slack bot for office automation using <https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient>
I want to know if there any examples which show how i can add buttons to messages and get feedback
as far as i can see you can only store teams/channels/users and retrieve them .. what i wanted to store somthing else and get it ? how ?
Hi all, anybody from the UK :gb: interested in checking out our bots new service, potential gift in it! :grin: Please let me know!
can anyone point me in the right direction? a tutorial?
Hey guys, can anyone help me by providing links for some great ideas to develop slack bots
??
Hey all, here is our Future of Bots panel with Dan Saffer and Hugh Dubberly: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWU3BdEKr0s>
Dan Saffer is awesome
Great post on CBM by <@U1HS554FN> about state of Commerce in chatbots <https://chatbotsmagazine.com/the-state-of-chatbot-commerce-in-2017-78763f48227b>
as far as i can see you can only store teams/channels/users and retrieve them .. what i wanted to store somthing else and get it ? how ?
<@U4FSUJLLU> you could just create your own DB and read/write to it. i'm helping out an internal project and we are using our own postgres DB and reading/writing to it
i don't know how to do that
<@U4PHRM50D> any hints ?
google it :simple_smile: we are using postgres as a DB but you could use whatever DB you want
assuming you're using node botkit, google 'node &lt;insert the DB you want to use&gt; tutorial'
i haven't the default json file storage that comes with the botkit but you could probably use that too. i couldn't help since i haven't used it
requests.exceptions.SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:661)
Any pointers on how to solve this?
<@U4SFSAMAS>: it might make more sense to ask in <#C1HJWSCL8|sdk-python-slackclien>
but off the top of my head, it seems like your system isn't set up quite right, because <http://slack.com|slack.com> has a valid SSL cert AFAIK.
will post there thanks buddy
