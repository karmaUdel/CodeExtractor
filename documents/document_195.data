U0JAVM98A : exact
U0GT29N3A : I wouldn't care if it was just some RTM disconnected here or there (this indeed happens all the time). But tonight was a bigger issue for us :slightly_smiling_face:
U0JAVM98A : yes, it was bigger than usual
U04SM6T2H : <@U1292LZFC>: <@U1D0EBWVC> the code is like 15 lines of php
U04SM6T2H : well maybe like 150 lines
U04SM6T2H : its just a wrapper on grep and reading and writing markdown files
U1292LZFC : <@U04SM6T2H>: you gonna make me dig out my PHP?! :wink: Cool - thanks, I'll give it a go
U04SM6T2H : haha
U04SM6T2H : i would say just build your own
U04SM6T2H : i mean, really this was a hack day project
U1292LZFC : ```npm install php -g``` right?
U04SM6T2H : hah
U1292LZFC : Actually I was digging around in the NodeJS version of TiddlyWiki, and it looks like everything is stored on the filesystem in a very similar way to your Wiki thing… so might get around the PHP part :slightly_smiling_face:
U0RRCPDK9 : Hey dudes :slightly_smiling_face: would anyone like to take Yala (<http://yalabot.com|yalabot.com>) for a spin atm? we need some feedback!
U0RRCPDK9 : Yala is a social media scheduling bot
U0RRCPDK9 : It's not released yet but I can send you a beta invite :smile:
U0K176R8A : anyone knows if there's an official limit on a message's footer length? <@U0J6FCFM0>(ours break because of long url tags that are not actually long once displayed but get truncated on the backend)

U0J6FCFM0 : @leo `footer` will be definitely truncated beyond 300 characters. Best practice is to keep it brief. (Stay tuned on the official word though)
U0K176R8A : <@U0J6FCFM0> it makes sense that we'd want to keep it brief on display, but currently something like &lt;long url|short text&gt; breaks
U0K176R8A : Could the limit be on the text being displayed as opposed to the underlying link / raw markdown?
U0J6FCFM0 : <@U0K176R8A>: That's a good idea. I'll share this with the team.
U0J6FCFM0 : <@U0K176R8A>: `footer` field is not intended to be used for this usecase. We may consider adding `footer_link` in the future. Please don't add links to `footer` right now.
U0HUZ214H : Hey fellow Slack Developers, MeetUpers and Medium readers! I wanted to share a Medium post about my breakout session during #HackWSU in Detroit two weekends ago where I also demoed <#C0AV5N8NA>. Thoughts and feedback are appreciated. Thanks!
