U2LAL86AY : ```type alias NewsItem =    { id : Int    , content : List (Html Msg)    , userId : 1    , chatId : 2    }
```
This should not compile

U2LAL86AY : you have values mixed with types.
U2LAL86AY : also is not so good to have `content : List (Html Msg) ` is better to just keep the data on your model , not html + data.
U641LDZFU : Ah, that was causing me trouble :slightly_smiling_face:
U2LAL86AY : i will do a rewrite here.
U641LDZFU : Ah sorry, that was an progress update to: ``` type alias ChatMessage =
    { id : Int
    , chatId : Int
    , userId : Int
    , content : List (Html Msg)
    }


type alias Transition =
    { transitionType : String, toStoryNode : Int, text : Maybe String }


type alias ChatNodeItem =
    { id : Int, nodeType : String, nodeContent : StoryNodeContent, state : Maybe String, transitions : List Transition }


type alias NewsItem =
    { id : Int
    , content : List (Html Msg)
    }


type alias NewsNodeItem =
    { id : Int, nodeType : String, nodeContent : StoryNodeContent, state : Maybe String, transitions : List Transition }


type StoryNode
    = ChatNode ChatNodeItem
    | NewsNode NewsNodeItem


type StoryNodeContent
    = NewsItemContent NewsItem
    | ChatMessageContent ChatMessage




type alias Player =
    { visitedStoryNodes : List StoryNode
    , currentStoryNode : Maybe StoryNode
    }


type alias Model =
    { player : Player
    }

```

U2LAL86AY : i understand what you are going after.
U2LAL86AY : why do you need to have `content : List (Html Msg)`
U2LAL86AY : auch ! :smile:
U641LDZFU : Vielen Dank!
U2LAL86AY : ```type Msg
    = NoOp


type alias Model =
    { player : Player }


type alias Player =
    { visitedStoryNodes : List StoryNode, currentStoryNode : Maybe StoryNode }


type StoryNode
    = ChatNode ChatNodeItem
    | NewsNode NewsNodeItem


type StoryNodeContent
    = NewsItemContent NewsItem
    | ChatMessageContent ChatMessage


type alias ChatNodeItem =
    { id : Int, nodeType : String, nodeContent : StoryNodeContent, state : Maybe String, transitions : List Transition }


type alias NewsNodeItem =
    { id : Int, nodeType : String, nodeContent : StoryNodeContent, state : Maybe String, transitions : List Transition }


type alias ChatMessage =
    { id : Int, content : List (Html Msg), chatId : Int, userId : Int }


type alias NewsItem =
    { id : Int, content : List (Html Msg) }


type alias Transition =
    { transitionType : String, toStoryNode : Int, text : Maybe String }

```

U2LAL86AY : i need that function causing the problem
U641LDZFU : The problem is it's many :slightly_smiling_face:
U641LDZFU : I think I will have another hack at it tomorrow
U2LAL86AY : ```Hint: Problem in the `nodeContent` field. Looks like a record is missing these fields: chatId and userId
```
THis error has a line number

U641LDZFU : yeah, that's why I thought I needed another union type for nodeContent
U641LDZFU : so they could also be different-but-the-same
U2LAL86AY : oh
U2LAL86AY : no
U2LAL86AY : :))
U641LDZFU : I better get to bed, thanks again!!
