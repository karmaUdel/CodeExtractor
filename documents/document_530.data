U3SJEDR96 : as an aside; it doesn't hurt to point out that they're monads, but involving category theory isn't necessary to understand how to use them
U0LPMPL2U : Yeah, the monad-iness of `Maybe` and `Result` is not really relevant to how the types work
U6D3ERLA1 : (I'll p[ost a gist of what I'm working on - installing vim-gist a minor detour :blue_car: )
U0LPMPL2U : <https://ellie-app.com/new> is a great place to put live Elm snippets
U5E99RPK6 : is there an equivalent `rails new` for elm? like an officially-sanctioned way to bootstrap a new project w/ a directory structure and default files?
U5XC2FJ1Y : a `Maybe` is either `Nothing` or `Just` a value, you use pattern matching to operate on it based on which it is (and extract the value if it has one)
U6D3ERLA1 : <https://gist.github.com/9d90524a44777979e9ba3c441711d998>
U0LPMPL2U : <@U5E99RPK6> there isn't a single way to organize files / directories in an elm app
U0LPMPL2U : I have used <https://github.com/simonewebdesign/elm-new> but it is very bare bones
U6D3ERLA1 : (Ignoring the typo, what I get here is)
U6D3ERLA1 : ```-- TYPE MISMATCH -------------------------------------- daily_programmer_xml.elm

The 2nd argument to function `tag` is causing a mismatch.

42|        Query.tag "lastName" string value)
                                ^^^^^^
Function `tag` is expecting the 2nd argument to be:

    Value -&gt; Result String a

But it is:

    Decoder String
```

U6D3ERLA1 : I'm at the bottom of the learning curve regarding these more complex (?) types...
U0LPMPL2U : no worries, we've all been there at some point :slightly_smiling_face:
U5E99RPK6 : <@U0LPMPL2U> that's unfortunate :confused: i found create-elm-app, now you mention elm-new... now there's one extra decision i wouldn't want to make as a beginner. do you know if this is something the core devs are concerned about? i mean, elixir went ahead and added `mix new` to the language itself, so for phoenix it's a simple `mix phoenix.new`. anyway, any i'll give both a try and see what i find, thanks!
U0LPMPL2U : The thing is, Elm is a language, not a framework. So the equivalent of a start app is super minimal
U5E99RPK6 : why not have a bit of both? i assume elixir must also allow one to just do `elixir &lt;file&gt;` or something like that, but if you're starting something bigger, it has the tooling and, most importantly, the _conventions_ for it. even if it's optional, it would be nice to have a blessed official starter cli thing, imho :slightly_smiling_face:
U0LPMPL2U : I think elm apps tend to vary more though. An SPA with routing is different from an embedded widget or a non-routed SPA
U0CQ254F5 : <@U6D3ERLA1> is the `string` function from the `Json.Decode` lib or from the `Xml.Query` lib?
U0CQ254F5 : it looks like <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/eeue56/elm-xml/2.2.2/Xml-Query#string> would satisfy that particular type mismatch
U3SJEDR96 : Agreed on principle, but not in practice - I feel like the language and conventions are still a little too much in flux to present this type of "this is how to do it." The very very basics are there already, tho - `elm-package install` will create a package file and install minimal dependencies for an HTML app. Creating a `Main.elm` or whatever and starting elm-reactor is the bare minimal to get started.
U5E99RPK6 : that makes sense. i guess for now it's better to let the community come up with different and possibly overlapping generators and see which ones get traction. later the winning strategies can be adopted upstream.
U5E99RPK6 : also, i didn't know i could start a project with just `elm-package install` so thanks for that :grin:
U6D3ERLA1 : <@U0CQ254F5> Indeed that fixes the type mismatch - thanks! What led you to that conclusion?
U0LPMPL2U : `Decoder String` is a type from `Json.Decode`
U0CQ254F5 : following the compiler messages is super helpful…it's helped me out of a lot of pickles```
Function `tag` is expecting the 2nd argument to be:

    Value -&gt; Result String a

But it is:

    Decoder String
```

U0CQ254F5 : its saying that "Hey that `string` value you provided is of type `Decoder String`, but I expect a function of type `Value -&gt; Result String a`
U0CQ254F5 : the more you work with Elm and it's compiler the more these messages will makes sense…don't get discouraged <@U6D3ERLA1>, it may seem over the top now (or too restrictive), but it'll be worth it once it clicks
U6D3ERLA1 : It's pretty foreign :slightly_smiling_face:
U0CQ254F5 : also, once you get more and more comfortable working with types and satisfying the compiler, <https://klaftertief.github.io/elm-search/> may prove to be a helpful tool
U0CQ254F5 : for example, i just plugged in `Value -&gt; Result String a` and saw that there was a function in the `Xml.Query` lib
U6D3ERLA1 : aah
U5WD40ZA9 : I'm trying to create a binary tree in elm with an unknown amount of child nodes. The special thing about it is that I want to be able to handle onClicks on the elements and update that specific node, any guides or ideas on how you could possible do that?
U0CQ254F5 : <@U6D3ERLA1> i totally get it, hang in there, take it slow, go through the elm docs, even a few times if necessary
U0CQ254F5 : my guess is you'll really start to love working within the constraints that types provide
