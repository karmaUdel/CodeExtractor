U0EUHKVGB : So, two questions:- Why do you think it would be nasty?
- What is the type of the console function?

U5YKRLXGT : Doesn't IE have a hard limit on the number of style tags you can have in a document for starters?
U5YKRLXGT : Console looks like this:
U5YKRLXGT : ```console =    styled Html.pre
        [ padding (em 4)
        , backgroundColor (hex "000")
        , color (hex "fff")
        , height (px 300)
        , overflowY scroll
        ]
```

U2LAL86AY : is not clear why this can't be  done using just function application. console is a specialized version of some div - with styles applied. is it not?
U0EUHKVGB : <@U5YKRLXGT>, what is the _type_ of that function?
U5YKRLXGT : It returns a `-&gt; Html.Html msg` right?
U5YKRLXGT : I literally started programming Elm today :slightly_smiling_face:
U0EUHKVGB : No, I don’t think it does.
U5YKRLXGT : In another language I might do this:
U5YKRLXGT : ```view model =
    stylesheet (\css -&gt;
        div []
            [ h1 [] [ text "Hi" ]
            , css `console [ Html.Attributes.id consoleId ] [ text model.lines ]
            , button [ onClick (Send "Hello") ] [ text "Append" ]
            ]
    )
```

U0EUHKVGB : Depends on the type of that `styled` function.
U5YKRLXGT : and have `css` evaluate a literal and then save the rules into a list
U5YKRLXGT : and then at the end of the stylesheet function, dump out a &lt;style&gt; tag
U0EUHKVGB : That is not how Elm works nor will it ever be
U5YKRLXGT : No, exactly!
U0EUHKVGB : Great, so we’re on the same page.
U5YKRLXGT : ```view model =    stylesheet (\mailbox -&gt;
        div []
            [ h1 [] [ text "Hi" ]
            , console mailbox [ Html.Attributes.id consoleId ] [ text model.lines ]
            , button [ onClick (Send "Hello") ] [ text "Append" ]
            ]
    )
```

U5YKRLXGT : So then I thought this, with a foldp at the end
U5YKRLXGT : imagine mailbox is accumulating rules as the view runs
U0EUHKVGB : :scream:
U5YKRLXGT : haha :slightly_smiling_face:
U5YKRLXGT : I want the output to be:
U0EUHKVGB : That would not have been a good idea even in 0.15.
U0EUHKVGB : Okay, hold up a sec
U5YKRLXGT : ``````div []    [ h1 [] [ text "Hi" ]
    , div [ Html.Attributes.id consoleId ] [ text model.lines ]
    , button [ onClick (Send "Hello") ] [ text "Append" ]
    ]
style
    ...rules from every styled element```

U0EUHKVGB : That library has sadly led you down a bad path - in Elm, we _like_ things to be pure
