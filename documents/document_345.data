```
this does not compile, but can you match for different types in Tex?
As far as I know, it does not work that way.
so you'd have to specify what type of Tex the function fort accepts? i.e. `fort: Text Int -&gt; Int`
Yes, you always need to specify something. It can be an explicit type like `Int` or it could be another type variable like `a`. The thing is that you can't really tailor the implementation based on that type variable as far as I'm aware. The type variable there is meant to provide a layer of generalization for when you want the same operation to be applicable for all types.
I would recommend making separate functions if you need different behavior for different types.
ok
<@U663M2MB7> yes it does. You can decode what ever structure
it's rather interesting to me that you can use variables in Elm code before they are actually defined
<@U39DE7RQ9> do I attach a separate decoder for the objects in the list below the top element or is there something else here? reading the docs does not really make this clear to me
scav: yes I can show you an example, w8
