U3SJEDR96 : yeah, though I think I'd rather work with functions that _know_ how to calculate the `right` based on the current state.. And perhaps even better, if I change the `width` through the proper function, I'd expect the model to be in a consistent state afterwards
U5Q1H5XC2 : cool thanks for the help, I shall experiment a bit further.
U0CLDU8UB : Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
U284ZSVSN : Hi, can anyone recommend elm-return over elm-response or vice versa? Or recommend not using them? Or any alternatives? I'm starting to think I might be starting to see the gains but I'm not sure which to go for
U4872964V : <@U284ZSVSN> they look identical to me :slightly_smiling_face:
U4872964V : <@U284ZSVSN> but I've never had the need for those abstractions, I don't have that many "sub-components"
U284ZSVSN : Good to hear :slightly_smiling_face: I can avoid it I imagine but I've not really done much 'chaining' with the model in the update and have one situation where I've got an operation that comes up a few times that I'd like to make a function for and wondered if I should start using one of these.
U3LT1UTPF : I want to add a dropdown select so that when the value is changed the page is updated. I thought it would be easier to do it myself, but I've found that it's necessary to keep an eye on the state of the dropdown. I've found some "components" in elm packages, like this one <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jschonenberg/elm-dropdown/latest> , but I don't know if I should go on that road. Any advice on how I should face the issue?
U64D26Q95 : Hi guys,
I am trying to replicate of my existing React/Redux application in Elm. I am struggling with the following part: I need to fetch data from few different urls (asynchronously) and as soon as I will get all responses back I need to dispatch an action (for example: LoadCompleted). As far as I understand I need to use Cmd.batch for many asynchronously requests, however how can I dispatch an action as soon as everything fetched?

It is probably stupid question, but I am struggling find any information about this kind of case. Can anyone help me, please?

U3LT1UTPF : <@U64D26Q95> I learned a lot from this article series: <http://codeloveandboards.com/blog/2017/02/08/phoenix-and-elm-a-real-use-case-pt-2/> I link to the second chapter because you probably don't need the Phoenix stuff (the backend that gives the json). You probably need from "The Messages" on.
U3EPLC6A0 : <@U64D26Q95> Have you seen RemoteData? It helps you keep track of the "download-state" of your data. It even forces you to do so. So, as soon as everything is ```Success a``` you're there. <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/krisajenkins/remotedata/latest>
U3LT1UTPF : The info is fetched in the init:```
init : ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init =
    initialModel ! [ fetch ]
```

`fetch` lives in Commands, fetches the info and triggers `FetchResult` in `update`

U3LT1UTPF : Yes, RemoteData seems a good option.
U0FBZ4J5V : And have a look at the docs for `RemoteData.andMap` for a neat way to merge data-loads into a single result. 
U0CLDU8UB : With RemoteData, you would have a Msg for each of the responses. 
So in your model, you have a field for the responses
```
type alias Model =
    { a : WebData Thing
    -- ...
    }
```
This means that in the update, you simply go
```
ResponseA webData -&gt; { model | a = webData }
```

Now, there's no need for an action when all of the responses are in: 

```
view model =
    RemoteData.map resolvedView model.a
        |&gt; RemoteData.andMap model.b 
        --...
        |&gt; RemoteData.withDefault notResolvedView
```

U62PV9CPN : Is there a way to compile elm and see the error messages in the terminal rather than opening a browser?
U3SJEDR96 : I assume you're using elm-reactor? `elm-make` shows errors on the CLI
U62PV9CPN : Yeah I've been using `elm-reactor`. So I just intentionally changed a functions signature to something wrong and ran `elm-make` and it says it compiled successfully
U62PV9CPN : But running `elm-reactor` I see several errors
U64D26Q95 : Thank you very much everyone! Really appreciate that. `RemoteData` sounds good so far. I will check all links in depth soon and hope it will work for me :slightly_smiling_face:
U4872964V : <@U62PV9CPN>, are you passing the same file to elm-make as to elm-reactor?
