U1BP42MRS : Only with flask
U5LNXQHN3 : it is true, I'm pretty unhappy with most software I work with
U63VCB8AH : haha
U63VCB8AH : i'm sticking with `app.run()`` for now
U5VGKQ2SY : plt.plot(t, t, 'r--', t, t**2, 'bs', t, t**3, 'g^')Takes arguments in sets of 3:
&gt; (x-val, y-val, 'color/shape')
Each plots a function.

So `t, t, 'r--'`  corresponds to one line, `t, t**2`, 'bs'` to another, and `t, t**3, 'g^'` to another.

'r--', 'bs' and 'g^' indicate color and shape. example: 'g^' stands for green triangles.

U4BMZ90T0 : Best way to approach calling function using a dictionary to store the func object as a value. I'm doing this in a class so it doesn't quite work properly the traditional way of literally just using the function object name as the value.
U2AQJNW1G : Hi, I'm streaming audio from a radio station and want to same time save to upload it to dropbox, But couldn't upload to dropbox, however it perfectly stream and saves on  local drive, but can't upload to dropbox, here is the script ```        stream = urllib.request.urlopen(self.stream_url)        start_time = datetime.datetime.now()
        # open('stream.mp3', 'wb') as dest
        dest = open('recording.ogg', 'wb')
        while (datetime.datetime.now() - start_time).seconds &lt;= 30:
            print((datetime.datetime.now() - start_time).seconds)
            #dest.write(stream.read(1024))
            try:
                meta = client.files_upload(stream.read(1024), 'recording.ogg', mute=True)
                print("Uploaded " + 'recording.ogg')
            except:
                print("Failed to upload " + 'recording.ogg')```

U0LSCQQNR : What is client?
U5MV460AG : Hey guys, I've been working on a project, it's about searching for some news daily in GNews through Python... Here's my code:```from lxml import html
import requests

response = requests.get("<https://news.google.com/news/search/section/q/cfe> méxico")
# Check for request status
if(response.status_code == 200):
    pagehtml = html.fromstring(response.text)
    # Search for news headlines
    news = pagehtml.xpath('//div[@class="KaRWed"] \
                            /div[@class="deQdld"] \
                            /c-wiz[@class="PaqQNc"] \
                            /c-wiz[@class="lPV2Xe"] \
                            /a[@class="nuEeue"]/text()')
print("\n".join(news))```

U5MV460AG : But it doesn't print anything. I tried _almost_ everything :disappointed:
U42LCHFD2 : that xpath looks invalid
U5MV460AG : Sure? Python doesn't raise any exception
U42LCHFD2 : also you need to add `%20` in between `cfe mexico`
U5MV460AG : Then, still not working :disappointed:
U42LCHFD2 : I think all you need is `//c-wiz/div/div/c-wiz/a/text()`
U42LCHFD2 : `//c-wiz/a/text()`or `//*[@class='nuEeue hzdq5d ME7ew']/text()`

U5MV460AG : You did it! But I got the title `&lt;a href="actual url I want to import too"&gt;Title I just imported, and that's great!&lt;/a&gt;`
U42LCHFD2 : so you would pull in both
U5MV460AG : :taco: <@U42LCHFD2>
U5MV460AG : How? :open_mouth:
U42LCHFD2 : `//*[@class='nuEeue hzdq5d ME7ew']/text()` `//*[@class='nuEeue hzdq5d ME7ew']/@href`
U5MV460AG : In the same line?
U42LCHFD2 : I usually separate them
U42LCHFD2 : ```title = pagehtml.xpath('//*[@class='nuEeue hzdq5d ME7ew']/text()')website = pagehtml.xpath('//*[@class='nuEeue hzdq5d ME7ew']/@href')
return (title,website)
```

or you can do a list or whatever you want - if your writing it to csv then out put it to a list as a row

U5MV460AG : BTW, the code that worked was `//c-wiz/div/div/c-wiz/a/text()` :slightly_smiling_face:
U42LCHFD2 : if you change the last part to `/@href` that will give you the url
U42LCHFD2 : `/text()` gives you linked text , in this case the title
U42LCHFD2 : if you wanted the class name you would to `/@class` at the end - ( just to give you an idea how its grabbing pieces of data when you look at the raw html)
U5MV460AG : This is awesome, thanks again! Returned two lists, ready to work with them... THANKS!
U5MV460AG : :taco: <@U42LCHFD2>
U42LCHFD2 : thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
U663SK5K2 : ```nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
# Using map + lambda
my_list3 = map(lambda n: n*n,nums)
print(my_list3)

Output ---&gt; &lt;map object at 0x000000E8107DF0B8&gt;
instead of 
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

U663SK5K2 : why ?
