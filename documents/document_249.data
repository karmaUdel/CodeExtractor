```
I want to hide the implementation details in the documentation. I only want to mention type Catalogue, not the whole type
I get the whole type. But that should be hidden in the Documentation…
Don't know if its cleared what i want…. :confused:
I was looking at Richard Feldman's SPA example. In some file he uses a =&gt; operator. Unless I missed something, I haven't encountered this yet, although I followed a bunch of tutos and read Richard's Book. By example in <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Page/Login.elm> there is:
=&gt; NoOp
Yeah <@U5Z3Y472L> , did you have a question about that? Making your own operators is almost always a bad idea.
I think Richards use is maybe one of the exceptions where its handy. Maybe not tho.
Personally I do something just like Richards `=&gt;` but I do `:=` instead. I dont really understand how an arrow conveys what `(,)` does.
ok, I thought it was something I did not know yet about elm, but it's a user defined operator
thanks <@U14Q8S4EM>
Sure thing!
hello guys I need help writing a decoder
is there any way to break that process up into small steps
JSON decoder
yes!
in fact, that's the easiest way to build a decoder
start with the smallest parts of your decoder
my JSON file is thousands of lines long there's really no way to understand it completely the first time
then combine them into more complex parts
Also, there are automated tools like <https://eeue56.github.io/json-to-elm/> that might be helpful
In JSON they are written `List [Int, Int]` but in Elm they could be `List (Int, Int)`
your website returned me a very simmple answer
