Oh, alright. So even that `Ports.changeWindowTitle : String -&gt; Cmd msg` function doesn't have a side effect; and doesn't actually change the window title. Rather, it returns a `Cmd` that describe to the runtime that it needs to call a function in JS
so you probably want `ChangeWindowTitle page -&gt; ( model, Parts.changeWindowTitle (getPageInfo page |&gt; .baseTitle) )` or something like that
the important part is that you must return that Cmd from your `update` to have it do anything
, please?
so each deal is valid for each hotel? or..?
making a few assumptions here, but possibly something like this: <https://ellie-app.com/3FLMJtntJm8a1/0>

Don't we all?
with the elm debugger (seems to be builtin?) running in Chrome -&gt; is there a way to look into the Message contents?
if elm debugger is running you can just click on it and it will open a window with all the Messages and states
the thing in the bottom right corner of the page
also, for quick-n-dirty msg logging, `case Debug.log "msg" msg of` in your `update` :wink:
yeah but the Messages part of it is so small so I can't see the data, even when hovering over it
ah okay, it does not show the whole message content anyway (looked into the elm debug window with Chrome's devtools)
well, it's still awesome
ilias: Thank you very much for that!
Hey, I have scanned the FAQ, but couldn't find an answer, could anyone help me with a wee problem?
woah, `case Debug.log "msg" msg of` is great!
Tell us, Allan
I want to specify that the return type of a function could be one of a few things, is it possible? i.e. functio : Alias1 -&gt; model -&gt; Maybe OneOfAFewThings
you could do that by making `OneOfAFewThings` a type: `type OneOfAFewThings = AString String | OrMaybeAnInt Int | SomethingElseEntirely FooBar`
Awesome, thanks, will give that a whirl
You have to be explicit about the types, wrap them with a "tagger" and unwrap them where you use them, though
There are some good search terms for me :smile:
<https://guide.elm-lang.org/types/union_types.html> might help :slightly_smiling_face:
