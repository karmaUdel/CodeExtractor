U5V0HVAKB : and i just want to recreate this ``` 
showME: Test String
showMe= 
"hello" ```

its all about the syntax what "Test" is here

U5V0HVAKB : what it mean
U153UK3FA : ah, you're asking about type parameters
U5V0HVAKB : yes
U5V0HVAKB : :slightly_smiling_face:
U153UK3FA : eg. `List Int` is a list of ints
U153UK3FA : a good example is <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Maybe#Maybe>
U153UK3FA : ```type Maybe a
    = Just a
    | Nothing
```

U153UK3FA : the `a` in that type definition is a parameter, it can be any type
U153UK3FA : You can have a `Maybe Int` or a `Maybe String` etc.
U2FJ2D6M7 : Hello! I'm trying to output some HTML but having trouble breaking up my view. Essentially I would like an input/sentence like "This is a sentence" to be rendered like "&lt;span&gt;This&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;sentence&lt;/span&gt;" but having trouble extracting out a method and keeping the types correct. I think is probably a simple thing I'm missing, but if anyone has a spare cycle, would not mind some :eye:s.
```
renderWord word =
    span [ myStyle ] [ text word ]

renderWords sentence =
    let
        words = String.split " " sentence
    in
        List.concat (List.map renderWord words)


view model =
    div []
        [ input [ placeholder "Text to proof", onInput NewContent, myStyle ] []
        , (renderWords model.content)
        ]
```

As more experienced devs might be able to tell, I'm getting an type mismatch:

```
The argument to function `concat` is causing a mismatch. - Function `concat` is expecting the argument to be:

    List (List a)

But it is:

    List (Html msg)
```

U2FJ2D6M7 : I see why it's wrong, but I'm not sure what my option is.
U5V0HVAKB : List.concat (List.map renderWord words)
U5V0HVAKB : u are returning a list
U5V0HVAKB : oh no!
U5V0HVAKB : List.concat (List.map renderWord words)
U5V0HVAKB : your renderWord
U5V0HVAKB : return Html msg type
U2FJ2D6M7 : <@U5V0HVAKB> yes, I take it back, I didn't understand why it was wrong! ‘Fixed' by
```
renderWords sentance =
    let
        words = String.split " " sentance
    in
        div [] (List.map renderWord words)
```

U5V0HVAKB : the function List.concat
U5V0HVAKB : expected to have list type arguement of a list type not a list type of html msg
U5V0HVAKB : i think its about parenthese here
U5V0HVAKB : List.concat (List.map (renderWord words))
U5V0HVAKB : try like thius
U5V0HVAKB : or ``` 
renderWord words
  |&gt; list.map
  |&gt; list.concat
```

U5V0HVAKB : <@U2FJ2D6M7> ?
U2FJ2D6M7 : trying
U5V0HVAKB : if it's working it's all about the left to right  (or maybe the right to left better ^^) reading
