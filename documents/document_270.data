```
assuming that's the way to do it.  thanks again!
Is this JSON you're trying to convert to an Elm structure?
<@U601ELFEG> What do you mean by "don't want to author [..] in elm"? Do you mean that you don't want to write that in Elm or that you want to keep it in your codebase as plain HTML?
meaning I want to keep things like the content of the help panels authored in HTML - probably in a file apart from the elm code -
in the example there <@U0LPMPL2U>, but i also have the same issue for types.  so i think Dict should get me on the right path.
ditto the control panel (it has some meticulously laid out and styled buttons)
The structure of your types doesn't have to mirror the structure of your JSON
