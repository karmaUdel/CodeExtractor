U5V0HVAKB : using toString ?
U1AN4JRFV : `String.toInt` ?
U23SA861Y : right and its going to give you a Result which is either a valid Int or an error
U1AN4JRFV : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/String#toInt>
U23SA861Y : you need to handle both the case where it succeeds as well as when it fails.
U1AN4JRFV : <https://guide.elm-lang.org/error_handling/result.html>
U5V0HVAKB : wow not really clear
U5V0HVAKB : how to get the Err value
U23SA861Y : it's an algebraic data type or union type, the link <@U1AN4JRFV>  gave shows how you extract the types with a case statement
U23SA861Y : well, one way to extract the info
U1AN4JRFV : ``` case String.toInt userInputAge of    Err thisIsTheErrorValue -&gt;
      span [class "error"] [text thisIsTheErrorValue]

    Ok age -&gt;
       ... more html ```

U5XHTBFS6 : Hi, y'all!I'm having some trouble with the Http package, it seems it is not sending the headers i'm passing to the `request` function. I'm very new to frontend development, so I don't know if it's something I did, or if it's something with Elm itself, or some CORS constraint...

Any help on how to send headers would be appreciated!

Here's a simple program that reproduces my problem:

U5V0HVAKB : ``` isConvertible : String -&gt; Html msgisConvertible t =
 let
    (color, message) =
      case String.toInt t of
        Err msg -&gt;
          ("red", "not a number")

        Ok age -&gt;
          ("green", "OK")
   in
     div [ style [("color", color)] ] [ text message ] ```

U5V0HVAKB : its working but maybe its better to do a function ?
U5V0HVAKB : that return true or false?
U23SA861Y : <@U5V0HVAKB> I would put either the result in your model or convert it to a maybe type and store that.
U1AN4JRFV : <@U5V0HVAKB> rather one that returns `(String,String)`
U23SA861Y : <@U5XHTBFS6> what kind of error is the browser console showing?
U23SA861Y : <@U5V0HVAKB> err, nvm you need to set the field with the string value. Yeah you could probably refactor that code into something that returns a list of validation errors and then renders the list or shows ok if now validation errors are present
U5XHTBFS6 : <@U23SA861Y> No errors. When I open the the network tab on the inspector, I can see that the request is sent, but my headers are missing from the "request headers section"
U5XHTBFS6 : And I did a simple server that prints the headers received, and it prints the samething as the browser
U5XHTBFS6 : just general accept, user-agent etc., but with my headers missing
