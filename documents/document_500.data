```? Given that `/` says it’s arguments need to be `Float`, but the type declaration says it’s `number`?
then you just change the onConfrim message you pass to the view 
model field `confirm: Maybe String` should change then
because I can confirm more things than just deleting by id
Does it make sense to just use Msg there, or I should create my own union `type Confirm : Delete String | OtherThingToConfirm`
Generally, I prefer to keep the Msg focused on UI interactions, rather than logic
So I would make a new union
ok, thanks, this was helpful!
<@U1N4KAHT6> <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/issues/1373> it shouldn't, and it's a bug (with some known variations)
I thought so
I wish there was a way to convert any number to Float, it would make sticking to your own type signatures a lot easier
There is an issue for possibly changing `toFloat : number -&gt; Float` which would help :slightly_smiling_face:
<https://github.com/elm-lang/core/issues/721> tracked in that meta issue
Thanks, you seem to remember all the GH issues :slightly_smiling_face:
If you want to write down your ideas, I might be able to help. Its fun to dive into those topics
I have a record Product which I need to convert to a Javascript object to pass it to a custom element as a property: node "leaflet-map" [property "product" (Json.Encode.object model.currentProduct) ][]. The compiler says: Function 'object' is expecting the argument to be List (String, Value), but it is Product. Any hint?
What I mean by inlining is to move the data from the includes into the main attributes in the first plcae, so the includes are no longer needed
You need to build up a list of (String, Value) from your product
