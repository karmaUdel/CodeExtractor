I would presume you'd want to use the range `(1, n)`, the round brackets mean non-inclusive, so if `n` is 5 you'd want to test the in the range `2,3,4`, versus what you have `[1,n]` which means inclusive, so the range `1,2,3,4,5`.
As for simplifying it, it's already reasonably straight forward. Alternate approaches could be changing your `list = ` statement to `filter(lambda d: not n % d, range(2, n))`.
You'd also want to check that the input is a positive number, you can use `abs(n)` to ensure it's absolute
And as an aside, don't shadow builtins. `list` is a builtin, and you're shadowing over that name with your `list = ` assignment.
prime number factorization?
