U0HPZF95H : This is an interesting challenge and primary only applicable to bots in channels unlike SMS and the role they must play. Moderator vs Percipient
U0HPZF95H : and the greater question, even if there is a matching trigger, should it reply?
U0CNYC404 : indeed, I suspect it may depend on a channel and bot individual basis though
U0HBN0L9M : perhaps you could use a command to trigger one behavior or the other?
U0HS4LBTM : Hi all, quick question for the XOXCO devs, any plans to push the LunchBot into Howdy? Or any other lunch suggestion bots being created?
U0HPZF95H : Ive played with having a whitelist that you get added to once you at mention the bot, and you get unlisted after various events (delay between replies) or a trigger miss (off topic)
U0HSMB5FA : Hi All, Just wondering if anyone has had link formatting working
U0HSMB5FA : every time i try it, it puts the formatted text in the chat, rather than changing it to a link, with the correct link text
U0CSRV1TR : `parse: full` is your friend
U0HSMB5FA : yeah I had that set
U0HSMB5FA : ```{ id: 1,  type: 'message',
  channel: 'G0CXXXXXX',
  text: '&lt;http://url/|Link Text&gt; - Capture trip Updates (UserStory - Open)',
  username: null,
  parse: 'full',
  link_names: null,
  attachments: null,
  unfurl_links: null,
  unfurl_media: null,
  icon_url: null,
  icon_emoji: null,
  as_user: true }```

U0HSMB5FA : (sorry that was what is sent via the rtm.send command)
U0HSMB5FA : I wondered if it was due to the as_user being set to true?
U0CS7U85R : I use the chat.postMessage and it works fine that way.
U0CS7U85R : iirc, rtm.send isn't as full featured though it does have the formatting for urls mentioned in docs.. (but not the first time I got bitten by inconsistencies…)
U07VCKRUK : sadly the RTM doesn't support formatted links (nor any of those extra properties above) — chat.postMessage is the best way to go.
U0HSMB5FA : <@U07VCKRUK>:  awesome thanks :simple_smile:
U0HBN0L9M : is there a way to detect when one's bot have been kicked out of a channel ?
U0HBN0L9M : or if the channel the bot is in, is archived?
U0D7F12ER : Does anyone know of a bot that connects Slack to Gitter?
U0GT29N3A : <@U0D7F12ER>: SameRoom is a service that can connect both services
U0D7F12ER : <@U0GT29N3A>: thanks
U07VCKRUK : <@U0HBN0L9M>: here's an example of the RTM events you'll see.
