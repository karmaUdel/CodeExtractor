U0JFGGZS6 : recently added force-directed graphs for instance
U4WH8STNX : <@U681TBBUP> Actually the projects link is supposed to be that better documentation of the contribution process, maybe you can file an issue there and make some suggestions?
U4WH8STNX : I mean this one: <https://github.com/elm-lang/projects/blob/master/README.md>
U0JFGGZS6 : he also gave a talk on it at the recent elm europe conf
U681TBBUP : <@U4WH8STNX> yes that documentation of the process is great and my suggestions were not related to its contents but rather how a newcomer would go about finding it. The first thing I looked for was a `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the core repo as this is the way other langs (<https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md> , <https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>) seem to do it. Granted that elm is structured differently but it might be easy to just redirect people to the projects repo
U4WH8STNX : that would be a good suggestion, I'd like that
U4WH8STNX : <@U681TBBUP> welcome to Elm, let's conquer the future
U681TBBUP : :elm: I have certainly never been nearly as excited about writing a front end :grin:
U6602MZ9Q : Hey there, I have a small question
U6602MZ9Q : Is it possible to add an extensible record to another record?
U6602MZ9Q : Something like```
type Model = 
  {  MyOtherRecord r
      ... other things ...
  }
```

U0LPMPL2U : You would write that as```
type Model = { ... other things ... }
type alias Combo = MyOtherRecord Model
```

U6602MZ9Q : Oh that's great thanks!
U4WH8STNX : <@U681TBBUP> yes, it's not like when Angular became The Thing and the whole world would go nuts about it and I just didn't get it, same thing with your state of the art react/redux/immutablejs/reselect/webpack/... stack - I get almost all of that in Elm without the hassle and the brittle modelling and JS
U4WH8STNX : well mostly without JS
U681TBBUP : I'm particularly intrigued by how it fits together in real time application with something like phoenix on the back end. Since both techs are based on message passing (to some level), combining it with channels seems very powerful
U681TBBUP : <@U4WH8STNX> would a pr adding the appropriate links to the projects repo be accepted?
U4WH8STNX : That I can not vouch for :slightly_smiling_face:. Maybe have a quick PM with Evan about it. Seems like an instant win-win scenario to me
U4WH8STNX : or just put it on the elm-dev group and see what the response is? <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elm-dev>
U0J1M0F32 : <@U681TBBUP> <#C0H8V5YM7|elm-with-elixir> Is a room you could join and chat about elixir and elm together if you haven't already :smile:
U62BFCPPD : Hi, trying to get npm run watch working as per this post <https://maximilianhoffmann.com/posts/how-to-compile-elm-files-on-save> but it keeps complaining it can't find elm (''elm' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.)  If I just do the command (elm make game3.elm --output elm.compiled.js) from the command line it works fine.  Any help?
