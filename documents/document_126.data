that could be a sign of doing other things wrong I guess…
that doesn't surprise me, a keyword is a function
(What <@U050ECB92> said)
I suppose the `fn?` stole the good name early, but had the wrong semantics
yeah fn? really means "something that was created with `(fn ...)`"
fn? was added when trampoline was added
continue-trampolining?
yeah, I guess the answer of `(defmulti foo first)` `(fn? foo)` can be a guide there
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
i looked at the version compare and it seems like it will return `1.1` &gt; `1.9`
but i don't know how to crank it up since it's based on the pom file rather than a project file
10541c0254973ce045305499d4b5622073ede622 (is the trampoline commit fyi)
i'm not a java guy
it also specifies its own deps in the new edn format. does that make it "self-hosted"?
<@U11BV7MTK> if you have `mvn` installed you can crank it up using the commands in the README.  Use of mvn/pom is a one-time thing at setup.  (It will probably be handled by the package manager when this stuff filters over there)
thanks. i'll get that going tonight
