<https://github.com/pzavolinsky/elmx>
what exactly is problematic?
and how would another way of writing html help?, the default elm html is really nice once you have worked with it a little bit
I'm trying to translate existing bootstrap html into sections of Html
are you familiar with <http://elm-bootstrap.info/>
I played with it a bit
I've also attempted to use the Html2Elm but keep getting Text "" all over the place.
is elmx bad?
Or just not recommended?
