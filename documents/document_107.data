U060FKQPN : it uses the full int range
U1B0DFD25 : Thanks
U3J7HSKNC : this might be a dumb question - it likely is - but what is the best way to define a spec in `clojure.spec` for an argument that is a function of arity 1?
U3J7HSKNC : is that a thing?
U3J7HSKNC : Something that could be used to spec a function like `take!` from `core.async`:
```
(defprotocol ReadPort
  (take! [port fn1-handler] "derefable val if taken, nil if take was enqueued"))
```

U3J7HSKNC : for `fn1-handler`
U068SUJNT : How could I combine two images?
U1B0DFD25 : What's the pattern in Integrant/Component REPL development to pick up an edited configuration file on reset? Do you make it a component in the system? I'm building my system object according to the config so I can't do that.
U06FTAZV3 : <@U1B0DFD25> I tend to read the config file each time and merge the result into my system map. Using Aero to read the EDN file I then do something like this: `(merge-with merge system config)`.
U06FTAZV3 : With a component like this:
```
(defrecord Datomic [uri]
  component/Lifecycle
  ;; ...
  )
```

And a config file like this:

```
{:datomic {:uri "datomic:<mem://my-app>"}}
```

U06FTAZV3 : And a system map like this:
```
(component/system-map :datomic (map-&gt;Datomic {}))
```

U06FTAZV3 : Integrant does things slightly differently I believe?
U06FTAZV3 : Looks like Integrant will reload your config from this: <https://github.com/weavejester/integrant#configurations>
U1B0DFD25 : <@U06FTAZV3> Integrant config is the equivalent to Component's system, so it won't just re-read my external config file.
U06FTAZV3 : Yeah, from a quick look at the Integrant README, there is no explicit system map in Integrant.
U1B0DFD25 : That's what I like about it, the system map is data.
U06FTAZV3 : Component's system map is data too. :slightly_smiling_face:
U06FTAZV3 : If you've got a `config` somewhere as per the README, and reloading is done via clojure.tools.namespace, I'd expect changes to the file to show up.
```
(def config
  (ig/read-string (slurp "config.edn")))
```

U06FTAZV3 : Can't say I've used Integrant before though. Sorry.
U1B0DFD25 : You've given me a direction. Thanks
U068SUJNT : How can I add java dependencies to my clojure project?
U050MP39D : <@U068SUJNT> same way you add clojure dependencies. the project.clj dependencies list is just maven artifacts
U068SUJNT : okay.
U0BKWMG5B : <@U1B0DFD25> you might want to look at Integrant-REPL
U4DNSU5NE : Does anyone know of a fuzzy finder lib for Clojure? By fuzzy finding I mean that you can, for example, search for "msd" and it would match, and give a high score to, "my/secret/dir", because the letters appear at word boundaries.
U6BEL7FPC : Hi <@U0BKWMG5B>, I was wondering if i could ask you a <#C5K1SHR6X|duct> related question?
U0E0XL064 : <@U4DNSU5NE> <http://yomguithereal.github.io/clj-fuzzy/clojure.html> (and there's also a Java lib: <https://github.com/tdebatty/java-string-similarity> )
