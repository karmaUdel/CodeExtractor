```
types are capitalized, your Just int uses "int" as a regular variable
By type variable, you mean a lower case word like used in the type signature?
yeah
all variables are lowercase; if used in a signature, that variable is a type variable; if used in a definition, it's a regular variable, holding data
Yeah, in that case I can think of 0 declaring a variable, 1 specifying the type signature, and 2 that case statement stuff
