Well how-about-that
learn something every day
yada seem to have implemented something themselves <https://github.com/juxt/yada/blob/master/ext/oauth2/src/yada/oauth.clj>. Maybe its time we see a new repository appearing under your github account :wink:

Hmm looks like the `context` is passed along in every step. Hopefully I can just assoc.
That's not it. `assoc`ing to that context is not persistent
over steps
One solution is to keep a separate database, but it is not very clean
Aaah you can send the context forward
Return `[result context]`
Next question: in `clj-gatling` my response times are way longer than they actually are. It seems like it is not only counting the time my request takes, but also the time it takes to run on my computer. Is there a way to fix this?
But the end result in the Gatling reports states it lasts longer than 1200ms.
why is it wrapped in a go block? Is clj-gatling designed around this
cause you're doing a blocking call with @?
Well spotted
If I don't wrap it in a go-block the same problem occurs
