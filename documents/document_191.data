U0HBN0L9M : etc
U123SGBU3 : Hi guys! Hope you are all well.
I'm trying to get one of the example bots working, however,  I can't seem to get connected to the RTM API:

`notice: ** BOT ID: planysbot ...attempting to connect to RTM!`

Any idea what can be going on here?

U124JH8F9 : probably gonna need a little more context
U123SGBU3 : I've just downloaded Botkit onto my mac, with the conversation bot, stuck in the Bot Token
U123SGBU3 : ```  planysbot node planysbot
info: ** No persistent storage method specified! Data may be lost when process shuts down.
info: ** Setting up custom handlers for processing Slack messages
info: ** API CALL: <https://slack.com/api/rtm.start>
notice: ** BOT ID: planysbot ...attempting to connect to RTM!
```

U124JH8F9 : so you changed no code inside of the conversation bot?
U124JH8F9 : also <@U0HBN0L9M> or anyone, do you know if botkit simplifies exchanging and storing a returned auth_code for an updated access token to attach to a user?
U124JH8F9 : do i need to keep track of access tokens for all users if I want to delete messages on behalf of them? or can i just get an admin to give the bot permission to delete everyone else's messages with one super token?
U123SGBU3 : all i done was hardcode my bots token
U123SGBU3 : instead of reading it from env
U124JH8F9 : is there another console.log after ```notice: ** BOT ID: planysbot ...attempting to connect to RTM!```
U123SGBU3 : no, it just kind of hangs there
U124JH8F9 : hmmmm
U0HBN0L9M : <@U124JH8F9>: botkit can handle the auth process for you
U0HBN0L9M : but I'm not using that
U0HBN0L9M : so I'm not sure of the details
U124JH8F9 : i'd like to do something like: <https://github.com/mvaragnat/botkit-express-demo/blob/master/app/routes/routes.js> and the `perform_auth` function on line 33
U124JH8F9 : but i'd rather use something built in if possible
U0HBN0L9M : well, see the botkit documentation then
U0HBN0L9M : they have something about setting up auth endpoints
U0HBN0L9M : what I did was, basically, removing this part and replacing with express
U04SM6T2H : <@U123SGBU3>: looks like you are good to go
U04SM6T2H : You should be able to talk to your bot after that point
U11QJQN79 : If anyone's interested, I started a channel for hosting bots on standard linux servers since all the tutorials I could find were only about hosting on Heroku and I didn't want to do that. <#C125MAGPQ>
U0SMQ77D1 : <http://dangrover.com/blog/2016/04/20/bots-wont-replace-apps.html> thoughts?
U0SMQ77D1 : I'm becoming less and less bullish on conversational UIs for most tasks
U0N77CFJ9 : Hi guys, im looking for a good standup bot for my dev team - i tried  howdy, and it seems good, but the limitation is that answers can't span multiple lines of chat, so team members are prone to hitting enter and finishing the standup by accident — any  other choices out there?
U0N77CFJ9 : I'm not that active here, so please do @ me if you respond :simple_smile:
U0554MQJB : <@U0N77CFJ9>: <https://twitter.com/peteskomoroch/status/719602135936045056>
U0N77CFJ9 : jesus
U0XDBSZ3L : lol
U0N77CFJ9 : im trying to use <@U0Y8F1QG5> first, but still experiuancing some pains
U0N77CFJ9 : anyone have a suggested workflow that's, well, awesome?
U0AFABJAJ : <@U0N77CFJ9>: I am biased but Tatsu is pretty good :simple_smile:
U07060PG9 : <@U0N77CFJ9>: glad you're giving awesome a try.  We don't replace stand-ups or aim to model them in Slack, but I'd love to hear your use cases and talk through workflows.  By using our `/worklog` command you can share milestones as they happen and the bot will organize and roll that up into an end of week `/recap`.  That's closest to stand-ups but we offer a bit more (highlights, sidebars).  Happy to chat through it over email or DM here.
U07060PG9 : Agreed that if you're looking for a stand-up replacement there are plenty of bots :simple_smile:
U0HBN0L9M : <@U0554MQJB>: wow
U0HBN0L9M : :feelsgood:
U0AQ8GPGR : Does anyone know if it's possible to trigger a `/slash` command inside a bot message?  
U0HBN0L9M : why would you want to do that?
U0HBN0L9M : couldn't you trigger the action server side ?
U0AQ8GPGR : Hmm, one particular case I had in mind was having the bot respond with `/giphy`. Sure, I can just make a call directly to giphy on the server, I just figured this would be a bit simpler. And I'm just a little surprised this wouldn't work.
U0AQ8GPGR : Then again, it's probably better to do it on the server anyway, in case the integration ever gets removed :thinking_face: 
Still, it would be nice to understand why this doesn't work.

U0AQ8GPGR : Ideally, I'd like to be able to check of particular integration is available, and respond based on that. If an integration was added, I could take advantage of it and save a few...milliseconds, up to a few seconds :simple_smile:  
U0AQ8GPGR : (But that sounds like a feature request.)
U120R8V4Y : Hey. Can anyone tell me if it's possible to have custom links/click handlers, like slackbot has for reminders?
U120R8V4Y : I can't find anything related in the documentation
U0GQ2JCCA : you can have links to things to external web pages, but you cannot do anything like slackbot does for reminders
U120R8V4Y : Damn
U0GQ2JCCA : an alternative may be slash commands or emoji reactions though
U120R8V4Y : That would be pretty nice
U0ERLS5EH : <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/general/p1460733907001569>
U0ERLS5EH : It's on the roadmap
U0ERLS5EH : Discussion at that link above
U120R8V4Y : Thank you! :simple_smile:
U0ERLS5EH : np, it's a commonly requested thing
U0GQ2JCCA : Please choose one of the floowing:
:checkered_flag: : Mark as complete
:timer_clock: : For 15 mins
:bed: : For 1 hr
:fire: : For tomorrow

U0GQ2JCCA : something like that i guess
U0GQ2JCCA : idk
U12JKC70F : Hi guys, I'm developing a web application using Polymer + Firebase. In my app, I'm trying to integrate it to Slack. In order to obtain an access token from Slack, I need to make an api call to Slack with the client secret key (generated by Slack).
The question is, where/how should I store this client secret key? Hardcoding this key in my Polymer/Firebase app sure sounds like a big security no no.

U0HBN0L9M : you use the secret server side, in theory
U0HBN0L9M : I'm not sure what it would look like with polymer+firebase
U12JKC70F : <@U0HBN0L9M>: thanks. Yeah, usually i store it as an environment variable in my backend but as im using firebase in this case...
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U12JKC70F>, if you want to go with zero backend, check out Auth0 to see if that would help
U12JKC70F : <@U0CS6NSF5>: but I thought slack only supports OAuth2.0?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U12JKC70F>: AFAIK auth0 can integrate with OAuth identity providers
U0CS6NSF5 : haven't used it myself
U12JKC70F : <@U0CS6NSF5>: am I right to say that for OAuth2, Slack currently only supports Server side applications?
U12JKC70F : For example, Google OAuth2.0 doesn't require client side apps sending secret keys...
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U12JKC70F>: Google's and Slack's OAuth2 are the same, you don't need the secret to start the authentication, but you will need it to get the token at the en of the OAuth process, and that should be done server-side
U12JKC70F : <@U0CS6NSF5>: in my app, I have a google sign-in dialog. After a user signs in, i get a token in the response. In this flow, my client app never has to send the google client secret key in the communication
U12JKC70F : however, slack requires me to send the client_secret before I can get the access token....
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U12JKC70F>: were you using the sign in with google button, with the javascript library?
U0CS6NSF5 : if that's the case, you don't need a secret because you are letting google's servers manage that part of the process, that's why I mentioned Auth0, they would be playing the same role
U12JKC70F : <@U0CS6NSF5>: thanks. Yes sign in with google button with the javascript library.
U12JKC70F : <@U0CS6NSF5>: an alternative might to spin up my own server... <https://www.firebase.com/blog/2013-03-25-where-does-firebase-fit.html>
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U12JKC70F>: yes, as I mentioned, auth0 is an option if you want to have zero backend :simple_smile:
U12JKC70F : <@U0CS6NSF5>: thanks! i've got 0 knowledge of auth0 currently :sweat:
U12JKC70F : do u think its possible Slack implements something like how Google is doing it?
U0CS6NSF5 : they basically offer all the user management and authentication as a service
U0CS6NSF5 : auth0
U12JKC70F : oh, auth0 is a service?
U0CS6NSF5 : yes
U0CS6NSF5 : <https://auth0.com>
U12JKC70F : ah ic... the r an identity provider
U12JKC70F : <@U0CS6NSF5>: Thanks! is stormpath comparable?
U12JKC70F : <https://stormpath.com/>
U0CS6NSF5 : sounds similar, haven't heard of them :simple_smile:
U0HNY2V47 : Stormpath are awesome :simple_smile:
U12JKC70F : <@U0CS6NSF5>: <@U0HNY2V47> thanks! :simple_smile: i'm checking out now... thanks for all the help <@U0CS6NSF5>
U0CS6NSF5 : My pleasure :)
U12LUGGKG : hey hye
U0YRBB3KN : hey, does anybody know if links to channels are supposed to work in attachment titles? They work on desktop but not on mobile
U117FDTLH : how to use botkit send a timing message ?
U117FDTLH : ex: I want send a message to a channel, every day 10am
U0XDBSZ3L : that's already built in `/remind [channel] [what] [when]`, although you may want something more complicated
U117FDTLH : thanks <@U0XDBSZ3L> ? but I want send some data read from database every day.
U117FDTLH : Maybe I should use `crontab`
U0HBN0L9M : <@U117FDTLH>: there are a number of cron/timing node library
U0HBN0L9M : that would be compatible with botkit
U0HBN0L9M : botkit doesn't have that built in
U117FDTLH : <@U0HBN0L9M>: thanks a lot, cron should be the right way.
U12TU5M32 : Hi guys.. How can i make my bot send a message to a user every time the user comes online, in a specific channel ?
U0K7Y2SK0 : <https://api.slack.com/events/presence_change>
U0K7Y2SK0 : Listen for presence change, then use chat.postMessage to initiate a message to the user. You'll need to specify the channel manually since presence change won't give you one.
U0K7Y2SK0 : <@U117FDTLH> - You're going to want to schedule it, yeah.
U120R8V4Y : Does anyone have experience in deploying bots without downtime?I mean at some point I need to restart the node process and current active conversations would be lost

U120R8V4Y : Is there any way to prevent this from happening?
U0K7Y2SK0 : I have zero experience with that, but my first thought would be a state persistence between distributed processes
U0K7Y2SK0 : So you might restart one instance of the bot
U0K7Y2SK0 : But there are multiple instances running
U0K7Y2SK0 : And they all know the same state info
U120R8V4Y : Hm..the problem is that I have multiple bots that are connected to different teams - but sharing the same node process
U120R8V4Y : So one process could spawn for example 100 bots
U0K7Y2SK0 : And it's all the same node process, running on the same host?
U0K7Y2SK0 : While I'm curious to know more about the implementation of that, I am also slightly horrified at the implications.
U0K7Y2SK0 : Like...  well, this case as a prime example.
U120R8V4Y : Well I'm using a (slightly modified) version of the botkit slackbutton implementation
U0K7Y2SK0 : Right. I might just not know enough about this to be helpful. Scaling like this is something I've seen a lot of talk about, but I've never handled it myself - just have some ideas in my head about how I'd approach it.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U120R8V4Y>: you'll need to keep multiple processes and have your app be ready to support more than one connection for a team in parallel (e.g: if you receive a message in two different processes, you reply only once)
U0CS6NSF5 : basically, redundancy + distributed locking or deduplication
U0CS6NSF5 : depends on your architecture
U120R8V4Y : Well there is none yet - I just want to have this covered before I launch something that isn't updatable correctly
U120R8V4Y : I have a hard time figuring this out.Lets take a simple example:

Version 1.0.0 of my bot is online and connected to two teams. In one team, it is having a conversation with a user and is in the middle of receiving information

U120R8V4Y : Now I pushed some code to master and trigger a new release 1.0.1
U0CS6NSF5 : to start, you probably want two processes connected to those teams, so if one of them dies or gets disconnected from the Slack API, the other can keep processing
U120R8V4Y : The only thing (in my opinion) that would get lost is the data inside a “conversation” (to stay in the botkit terms)
U120R8V4Y : And the state of the conversation would be lost as well
U120R8V4Y : Damn...it feels like I need to take care of this myself. I was hoping for a prebuilt bulletproof solution
U0K7Y2SK0 : <@U0CS6NSF5>: I'm actually really curious about this too. Like it's in my head as the 'right' way but as far as actually making it happen, I'm in the dark.
U0CS6NSF5 : I haven't used botkit, so no idea how much context they keep in processes themselves
U0CS6NSF5 : our service has been going way before botkit, so we've got our own infrastructure and libraries :simple_smile:
U11FSNKL0 : botkit only opens one connection per team
U120R8V4Y : <@U11FSNKL0> well I could open the node process a second team to trigger a second connection
U120R8V4Y : But each process would need to know it's current version - so the “old” bot no longer replies to messages if a newer version is already connected
U120R8V4Y : And then I still don't know when I can safely turn off the “old” process
U11FSNKL0 : I thought you could open a websocket only once... like if you open a second time the same websocket the other one closes
U120R8V4Y : No, just tried it. It connects a second time and the bot replies twice (so each process once)
U11FSNKL0 : oh nice!
U0CS6NSF5 : nope, last time I checked you could have at least 4 different WS connections going
U0CS6NSF5 : so don't go crazy with concurrent connections, but it's the way to go for redundancy
U11FSNKL0 : oh, that is great, they changed that at some point, I never tried again...
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U120R8V4Y>: you have to implement all that yourself, one pattern is having the botkit process with the RTM connection be really dumb and just pumps messages into a queue (ENCRYPTED!), and have workers process those messages
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0706A8RE>: the Slack API has always supported more than one RTM connections per token AFAIK
U11FSNKL0 : the problem is that I used some private methods before to login and they returned one wss that I'm sure you could use only once, the rtm. method must be the one that allows multiple connections I think... I'm not sure
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0706A8RE>: I'm talking about issuing several `rtm.start` requests and connect to each WS URL
U0CS6NSF5 : rather than making one `rtm.start` request and connect several processes to the returned WS URL
U0CS6NSF5 : :simple_smile:
U11FSNKL0 : yep, indeed, that is great, I didn't know as I just didn't try :simple_smile:
U11FSNKL0 : <@U0CS6NSF5>: yes, you are right, this was possible always, I'm confused with other thing... you could always login from iphone and web at the same time, is the same really
U0CS6NSF5 : yep :simple_smile:
U04S6E9EW : Forgive my ignorance, but what's the process for getting someone invited to this Slack org again?
U0HUTFBHS : We're not allowed to give you any slack invite -ing others to do so.
U0HUTFBHS : aww.  I thought that used to work.
U04S6E9EW : *looks under table for answer*
U0HUTFBHS : <http://dev4slack.xoxco.com/>
U04S6E9EW : :kiss:
U135X3DB3 : I'm just getting started, playing around with botkit.  I cannot find full documentation for it.  That is, I know I get a bot back from controller.spawn, but I want to know what I can do with that bot aside from startRTM.   it appears to have a lot of stuff, but my early experiments have not yielded useful info..  Is there documentation of all the objects and functions?
U135X3DB3 : I found this example ```bot.api.channels.list({},function(err,response) {  //Do something...
})```.   It would be nice to know what the first argument is.

U11FSNKL0 : <@U135X3DB3>: here is the docs from Slack for that method: <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.list>
U11FSNKL0 : you can check the examples folder of botkit to see some samples
U0T05GGGJ : I'm trying to learn how to make a bot. Right now, I have an application in Java on Ecplise that is able to use the scanner and do what I need it to do. I got some server space on the AWS free tier to host my bot. Now, what do I do to get the program able to read responses from a slack bot? I already have a bot that is trying to check for a message on a website to interact, but I have to figure out how to make my Java program to react to the Slack responses
U136XPJGL : Hi! anybody here?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U136XPJGL>: yes
U0T05GGGJ : Still looking for help! Doesnt have to be a long explanation maybe just a link that will help me get in the right direction
U11C8V57T : <@U0T05GGGJ>: Your question is pretty open-ended. It's hard to know how to help, but I'd say <https://api.slack.com> is the right place to learn about how bots work in general, and <https://api.slack.com/community#java> is where you'll find libraries specifically for Java.
