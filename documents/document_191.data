Hi all, would anyone be kind enough to offer some advice on using the Shopify Python API to programmatically pull report data from a store? Many thanks, Mike
anyone know of a script that can handle merges in order after waiting for circle to build (mvn release changes the version and we have to wait for develop to get that commit after circle builds), or am I going to have to write it myself?
Hello everyone, I have a bot on slack using botkit. How could I rename my bot using botkit?
change the name in <http://api.slack.com|api.slack.com>
why would you need to change the name more than once ? if thats the purpose i would look at their API, should be available calls for that
so weird; i couldn't login to the slack app with password; i had to magic link my way in.
I'm back after so many days due to work..And I missed a lot of conversations while i was away. Hello Everyone! 
I wanna continue with my botkit project where i left last time lol. I need to refresh a lot. Well, i have a question..
Can someone tell me how do i go about telling my bot to greet all new users privately (dm) when they join my default slack channel? 
there is a startPrivateConversation function <@U37C5V3HT>
which you can trigger off of the user_channel_join event
I see. So i have to use `user_channel_join` right <@U04SM6T2H> 
And any botkit version conflict? 
no

So far I've only been able to figure out how to update a message using BotKit's bot.replyInteractive
I just published a story about machine agents and deep learning aka "artificial intelligence" <https://medium.com/dronzebot/our-fears-about-machine-intelligence-make-is-less-prepared-to-face-our-future-35549863fa74#.ujao1wah1>
There is a big part of the article on Tay.
Anyone seen a bot or app that creates a publicly accessible archive?
Hi All, I have a python slackclient module question
relates to this SO question: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34044690/bot-postmessage-missing-icon-and-name>
basically my 'hello world' python code.. will show up fine.. as 'bot' with no user icon.. but will not show up as the '@security-bot' user with icon that I set up under 'Custom Integrations' --&gt; 'Bots'
I've tried setting the 'as_user' parameter to true.. but then the message doesn't show up at all
