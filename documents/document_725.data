U2LAL86AY : i simplified a bit:```
type alias WithUserFields a =
    { a | name : String }


type alias UserFields =
    WithUserFields {}


userFieldsFrom : String -&gt; UserFields
userFieldsFrom string =
    WithUserFields string

```
error: 
```
Cannot find variable `WithUserFields`
```

U2LAL86AY : so it seems like you can't have parametric types act as constructors
U3ZNWN526 : Oh, no, I have `UserFields` as the constructor within that last function, not `WithUserFields`
U2LAL86AY : Maybe is the same thing - since  it gives the same error.
if you have `type alias Thing = String `
you get back a function named `Thing : String -&gt; Thing`.

But if you have `type alias Thing a  = String `
Seems you don't have this `Thing: String -&gt; Thing` anymore. It's how elm works.
 Let me try a few more things first

U3ZNWN526 : Ooh, so you think even with `type alias Thing = MetaThing {}` maybe wouldn't give you the constructor?  I suppose that's possible... very unexpected though, and doesn't seem to be documented anywhere
U3ZNWN526 : I would think with a `type alias Thing = ` I could put anything after the `=` and it would give me a constructor.
U5J0H2NS2 : I think this```
WithUserFields a = { a | ... }
```
means only, that the type has several known fields.
You did not specify their order. So you can not construct one just like you wanted.

U2LAL86AY : hmm yes, you don't get alias constructors for aliases with parametric values:```

type alias FirstAlias =
    { name : String }


type alias SecondAlias a =
    { a | name : String }


constructAValueOfFirstAlias : String -&gt; FirstAlias
constructAValueOfFirstAlias string =
    FirstAlias string 
         --- works as expected because you have in the global scope a (function/variable) named: FirstAlias : String -&gt; FirstAlias 


constructAValueOfSecondAlias : String -&gt; SecondAlias {}
constructAValueOfSecondAlias string =
    SecondAlias string 
         -- error "Cannot find variable `SecondAlias`"

```

U3ZNWN526 : Oh well yes, that does make sense, because SecondAlias is not a type, you would only be able to construct other types using SecondAlias.  But what I'm trying to do is define a second type and then use it!
U0J1M0F32 : ```
type SecondAlias a =
    SecondAlias { a | name : String }

constructAValueOfSecondAlias : String -&gt; SecondAlias {}
constructAValueOfSecondAlias string =
    SecondAlias { name = string } 
```

U5J0H2NS2 : But this works```
type alias WithUserFields a = { a | name : String, email : String }
type alias UserFields = WithUserFields {}

change_name : String -&gt; UserFields -&gt; UserFields
change_name new_name user_fields = { user_fields | name = new_name }

get_user_fields : String -&gt; String -&gt; UserFields
get_user_fields name email =
    { name = name, email = email }
```

U3ZNWN526 : Yeah.  That seems right.  The problem I'm having is that for some reason... there's no `UserFields` constructor? (even though `UserFields` is just a plain old type alias)
U0CL0AS3V : &gt; all the structural problem i've been discussing started to surface in my company's app after it hit about 8000 lines of clojurescript (which have since doubled). I think none of the issues I present would be that apparent in smaller apps&gt; really the problems i'm talking grow exponentially with the size of your data model

we're at 150,000 lines of Elm code in production and these problems don't exist for us. I don't worry about the Elm Architecture scaling because my experience with it is that it's scaled better than any other front-end system I've ever worked on. :slightly_smiling_face:

U5QJW0DDE : Currently it is 15k lines. Do you find that either a) your data model lines up with your view tree much of the time or b) you pass the whole model state around often?
U0CL0AS3V : <@U5QJW0DDE> I get why you'd be worried about this, based on your experiences elsewhere, but the people saying "this is not a problem in Elm" are not making it up :wink:
U5QJW0DDE : <@U0CL0AS3V>  I still haven't seen any examples that demonstrate an Elm solution to, for example, the distant descendant drop down list I mentioned earlier
U0CL0AS3V : can you link me to that? I'm catching up
U3ZNWN526 : Aha! <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elm-discuss/DWrIVjwWzAU>
U5QJW0DDE : If you have any control over the elm discuss mailing list, I posted my first message there that sums up the issue, with examples, but it is stuck in moderation 
U5QJW0DDE : For a few days
U0CL0AS3V : I'm not a moderator there, sorry
U0CL0AS3V : can you make it a gist and link to it?
U0CL0AS3V : a) definitely not, b) definitely not :smile:
U5QJW0DDE : Unfortunately I made the mistake of not copying the message before I sent it to the lis so I will need to write it up again. I will ping you later if I have time. I'm in Europe and must leave work now. 
U0S6BNVNY : <@U5QJW0DDE> I have a `Store` that I pass around. Actually, views have a `query` function which, when given a store and any params they need from the slug, look up their data in the store.  That way I can pass a single bit of 'state' to represent my local database, which gets updated at the top level from websockets. That might help? This way I'm not sending the whole `Model`, just the 'data' bit
U0CL0AS3V : ok, happy to talk more when you can!
U0CL0AS3V : :wave:
U5QJW0DDE : I frankly don't see how that is possible in TEA so I will send more thoughts your way later. 
U0CL0AS3V : :thumbsup:
U0CL0AS3V : it definitely requires a mindset shift coming from OO :smile:
U0CL0AS3V : it's all good! happy to talk
U5QJW0DDE : Cool, I will ping you in a few hours. I have dinner plans. I keep hearing remarks from people here saying "it's not a problem in Elm" but yet no one can actually provide simple solutions to common problems in very large apps that my company builds. I watched your keynote conference talk where you discussed this a little bit, but did not come away from it feeling like the issue I'm referring to has an obvious solution in Elm. Will chat with you later!
U2LAL86AY : what's so wrong about this function? :smile:```

numberToFloat: number -&gt; Float 
numberToFloat number = 
    if typeof number == Int then  -- is not valid elm - but not sure how to construct it.
        toFloat number 
    else 
        -- is already float, don't bother.
        number 
```
Why can't i find it anywhere in Basics or using elm search?

U0CL0AS3V : sounds good!
U2LAL86AY : `toFloat: Int -&gt; Float` <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Basics#toFloat>
U2LAL86AY : seems i can't have `toFloat: number -&gt; Float`
U3ZNWN526 : I think you could actually just return number...
U3ZNWN526 : ```numberToFloat : number -&gt; Float
numberToFloat n = n
```

U3ZNWN526 : Maybe not...
U3ZNWN526 : But certainly you could do something like multiply it by `1.0`
U4872964V : toFloat could certainly be `number -&gt; Float` but I’d be interested in seing your particular use case
U3ZNWN526 : Which may illustrate why the function doesn't exist - because in most cases it wouldn't be useful (that I can think of anyway)
