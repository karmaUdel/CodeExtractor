```
it still fails on a clean compile
You don't have any custom effect modules, right?
david_hernandez: Maybe installing a  version in `yarn.lock` and have the team configure their editors to use `node_modules/.bin/elm-format` could be one solution?
I guess that doesn’t ‘enforce’ though.. :smile:
That could be a solution. But there is a problem if anyone is working in two different projects. But don't worry, we found a different solution: a elm format check on the CI to block PRs that don't follow the formatting of the last version of elm format
<@U3SJEDR96> no I don't have any custom effects
(don't even know how to do that :slightly_smiling_face: )
alright. Curious. I don't suppose that code is available somewhere by any chance?
not really sorry this is work stuff
Right. Does it work if you comment out the subscriptions? Does it work with only one? If so, can we pinpoint which one?
let me check
so it's def not hot releading I commented that out
and amazingly the error still occurs with a Sub.none
weird
but I kind of have the feeling that it's more related to a port going into JS
<@U1N4KAHT6> Quick comparison between elm-visualization and elm-plot? It would help to have it, if possible.
That is… Is the approach fundamentally different from Elm-plot?
<@U3R7CKQRX> ah, reproduced it. It's a JS side thing, indeed - subscribing `undefined` to a port triggers that. <https://ellie-app.com/3DW84DP65tBa1/0>
or even just `app.ports.foo.subscribe()`
oh wow <@U3SJEDR96> thanks
that fixes it
Anyone got any suggestion on how to track whether the current browser tab is the active one? I believe checking window.blur/focus is a common way in JS land. But in Elm..? :slightly_smiling_face:
i'll remember that for next time
<@U4PT7NG4V> you mean something like this: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/page-visibility/latest> ?
Sounds exactly like it! :slightly_smiling_face: That's super
i’ve never used it though, but it’s maintained by `elm-lang` :smile:
<@U41NK9BM4> the approach is fairly different, although elm-plot has changed a lot recently. elm-visualization is meant to be a fairly low-level toolkit suitable for implementing fairly custom visualizations (for example something like <https://ellie-app.com/3DR8Yd6sHBQa1/0>), whereas elm-plot roughly fits the charting library bill. So in summary, if you need a pretty standard chart, elm-plot makes that pretty easy, whereas if you need some help building something new, than elm-visualization should be a good friend
<http://caniuse.com/#feat=pagevisibility> That's promising too :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks, <@U17J54S2U> ! I'll give it a go
<@U1N4KAHT6> Crystal clear. Thank you
How do you peeps work with CSS files in your projects?
<@U17R26VR8> <@U3SJEDR96> . Sorry, I've just gone out. I don't touch anything on DOM. I add material design lite css with elm and webpack. When I work on menu and I click on menu, the error appear.
<@U3U2EA14G> do you have this code anywhere on github?
sorry,  It only have on my computer
let me take a picture
<@U3YDBDP4Z> We use a combination of css files and elm-css
we store the css files in our server code (we use rails)
this is gist <@U3SJEDR96>
what is `layout.js`?
ah, it's material design lite module.
Does the error still appear if you comment that out from HTML for a minute?
wait a minute. let me try :smile:
wow, it work
so it conflict with material desgin js file.
:tada:
well, the material design JS seems to add/change/remove/replace DOM elements, which tends to really confuse Elm and can give very unexpected results
Thank you so much <@U3SJEDR96> . I think i need to change material design js file.
btw, if i build a website with elm and golang. So I will use golang for build html and url, elm only used for single page. Is it ok ?
But I don't know how to pass parameter or session via elm.
