            List.map (index table) [10]```
it would be more `List.map (index table) [10000]`
yeah, I see now
I misread what maximum was
but that works just fine at 10000
20000 also works
Okay, so it is the map
not the foldl
the original List.map
yeah
in `getAll`
or is it perhaps the range itself
nah range works fine
hmm what happens if wrap a closure
nah closure still pops it
hmm if range is fixed it seems not to pop?
hmm it's seems to be length or range * length of table or something like that
