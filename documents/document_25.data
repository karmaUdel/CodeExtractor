then I get a better idea of what code is blowing up
Does anyone know how to create a parameterized type instance (java interop)? E.g. new MyPType&lt;Integer&gt;
<@U06BUCH6D> that doesn't actually exist
OK…because param types are only compile time, correct?
it's a thing the java compiler pretends is there, but isn't actually a thing in the relevant bytecode
<@U051SS2EU> mith ok thx!
<@U06BUCH6D> right, type erasure (with the exception that you can use reflection to find the generic type - but that's not actually as relevant as one might think)
the important thing is the code just works without it
True..I should have known :slightly_smiling_face: thx
<@U08UTJ5PB> Sounds like an ipv6 issue. What OS are you running on, try adding -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true to your JAVA_OPTS
Is there an obvious way to write the following without repeating `x`? `(if (some-pred? x) y x)`
Meaning if `x` is ok, just use it, otherwise use the alternative `y`
What can be a root of problem?
The solution is to add this line to .bash_profile `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)`
<@U0B4ZBBKM> maybe look at cond-&gt; ?
<@U06GS6P1N> You'd have to repeat `x` just the same
hey all. I'm use data.zip.xml/xml-&gt; to parse some XML
deep breath… ok:
I'm trying to navigate a blob of XML and parse out a map of information
