<@U0CL0AS3V> thanks man, will do! :slightly_smiling_face:
Folks posted my first blog on Elm. This was an issue for me and my team members while understanding Elm. It's very basic stuff. <https://blog.bigbinary.com/2017/07/12/difference-between-type-and-type-alias-in-elm.html> . If anyone has any feedback then let me know. Thanks everyone and keep on Elming.
