<@U5FC7BE0G> There is `model.something |&gt; Maybe.map (\_ -&gt; someCmd) |&gt; Maybe.withDefault Cmd.none`. If you really want to shrink things down in a particular place, though, make a function.
thanks <@U48AEBJQ3> ! I thought maybe there's already something built in for this, but i'll create my own shortcut then
Wanting to unit test my `update` function, but I don't know where the `ChangeLocation` and `OnLocationChange` messages come from?
Need to import them in my tests
I'm not familiar with those constructors, are they from a package you are using, or something you defined yourself?
I'm not sure where they come from.
I would have assumed the Navigation package but it doesn't mention them
And the only other package I have is url-parser, which doesn't have them either
Which is confusing, since I use them in Update.elm but they are not imported from anything
If you are using them somewhere, they are either defined there or they are imported. This is a reason to not import `exposing (..)`, since it makes it more difficult to know where things come from. The navigation package doesn't define any constructors by those names.
Haha, you are absolutely correct
I was having a brain fart
<@U5FC7BE0G> `if model.something == Nothing then Cmd.none else someCmd` perhaps. If you're not interested in the actual contents of the `Just`
... which works like a charm :slightly_smiling_face:
great
Why does it says `number1`?
IIRC it is a way to say: could be a different type than the other `number`
(Int vs. float  - for example)
i'm doing the intro guide and it had me clone over the code examples. however, i want to write these programs myself while I go along. Can I just open up an example.elm file in my text editor, write the code with the tutorial and then...what. Run elm-make to make an html file? and then I can just throw that in the browser to see if it worked?
you can do it with elm-reactor as well
which will compile elm files and serve them for you
i see. i guess the examples in the tutorial also happen to be in the directory i installed so I can just open up those exact files with my text editor
<@U635238TG> i typically use elm reactor for every meaningful change to quickly test functionality in localhost. elm-make I save for when I'm pushing to remote repo. But I know a lot of folks use automated build tools that run elm-make on every save sometimes.
You can use `elm-reactor` when you working only with Elm files. If you working with custom setup, e.g. you integrate Elm into html page, then e.g. `webpack` can help with automated compilation.
<@U0J8D9M2P> elm-reactor wont work with js interop right?
I cannot install elm on redhat:
npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.
Any idea ? If I create the /usr../elm directory manually it will be deleted during installation.
<@U2SR9DL7Q> It can serve files but it will not automatically compile elm files into specific output file for you (which you can specify with elm-make command). So with `webpack` can handle this work.
<@U60ERSLUQ> it says `permission denied` are you sure you have correct rights to write into that directory?
I have run it as root. Permissions of /..../node_modules are 755, owner root:root.
I could run 'node install bower'
It's not recommended but have you tried to run that with `sudo` ?
<@U0J8D9M2P> : Same behaviour with sudo
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm> It has Troubleshooting section
How about not running as root?
<@U0J8D9M2P>: I check the troubleshooting section: npm has the latest version, npm cache is ok.
Anyway, here's a troubleshooting page for npm permission issues: <https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions>
<@U0CLDU8UB> <@U0J8D9M2P> setting npm config prefix (It was /usr) to a local non-root directory as described in <https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions> finally worked. Many thanks for your help.
I got it working for one "Foo" {x:5}, but not for many.
<@U604S603Y>: Json.Decode.list does that
`Json.Decode.list decodeItem`
<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Decode#list>
ah okay, I tried to call succeed (Json.Decode.list decodeItem)
thank you <@U1AN4JRFV>
<@U2SR9DL7Q> <@U0J8D9M2P> <https://blog.ilias.xyz/elm-reactor-and-custom-html-9e7143553807> fyi :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U3SJEDR96> knowledge is power :+1:
Is equality for records value equality or entity identity?
`{ item: "wheel", size: 3.5 } == { item: "wheel", size: 3.5 }`
tested it (with the correct syntax) - value equality!
<@U601ELFEG> everything is or should be, with a few exceptions where it's not really defined
Can somebody share link to some example how to properly do SPA routing with elm-bootstrap, please?
