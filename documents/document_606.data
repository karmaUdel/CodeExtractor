    tHexToColor tHexString__purple```  I want to take the string `"purple"` and use that directly for the Tachyons, and then for the graphics prepend with `"tColor__"`, and then call programatically. This way the colors are synched automatically.
<@U3L8MM10T> I see, then a Dict is probably the best
or, since they are just class strings, use the `class` attribute directly.
I don't follow how `Dict` helps.
