so `digitCount (1000 ^ 1000) |&gt; isInfinite |&gt; Expect.true "that should really be Infinite."`
unless digitCount returns an `Int` :sweat_smile:
hi, can someone explain further about Routing or Navigations?   i.e do i create different div containers to load data into ti when a next page is switched? i. e Home, About us etc??? or a different views with it's own page. I m still confused in that part.
mean, do i use Rest API to fetch data into containers or I need to create different html page linking then as normal html ?
This is a good source but as the article states it's not a smooth introduction :slightly_smiling_face: <https://dev.to/rtfeldman/tour-of-an-open-source-elm-spa>
thanks
A look into these files should suffice to get how you could do routing, as always there is no *one* solution. <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Main.elm> <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Route.elm>
I have another JSON decoder question :stuck_out_tongue:
this json `{"custom":{"20170414":[900, 1300],"20170415":[],"20170417":[]}`
I want to try and decode into these types
