U4WQHR2DC : :0 I didn't even know that existed. thanks
U4WQHR2DC : and `lein run` and… java I think
U4WQHR2DC : ```(ns thing.core
  (:gen-class))

(require 'clj-slack)
```

U5XMV6DQT : require should be :require inside ns declaration
U4WQHR2DC : same issue
U050MP39D : <@U4WQHR2DC> the clj-slack library does not seem to have a namespace `clj-slack`, so you can't require it
U050MP39D : I see `clj-slack.users` etc
U06F82LES : should it be clj-slack.core ? <https://github.com/julienXX/clj-slack/blob/master/src/clj_slack/core.clj#L1>
U65NWMNN5 : I would like to create a registration form with ```ClojureScript``` using ```React-Native``` (and ```Reagent``` thereafter). And I would like to include the different components with MaterialDesign, and I do not know how to do it. Do you have any suggestions? I have already found on the Internet, but I did not have much.                  I just want to create a simple registration form, using `ClojureScript` `MaterialDesign` `ReactNative`.
U65NWMNN5 : Thanks in advance for your feedback.

U3QUAHZJ6 : hello everyone, im trying to figure out uncessary dependencies on my project (im using lein)
searching the webs ive found `lein deps :tree` but its output is quite large and im not sure where exactly to look

U3QUAHZJ6 : does anyone has any suggestion?
U050MP39D : so I have a project, which has :aot :all in the :uberjar profile (in this scenario compiling at runtime was significant, trust me, I measured) but I'd prefer not to have that accidentally interfere with dev if a dev creates an uberjar on their machine. is there any way to either have leiningen delete the .class files after the uberjar is created, or exclude target/classes from the classpath?
U087U9YG3 : I'm a little bit confused — ^bytes is supposed to be a valid type hint and I'm supposed to be able to type hint the return value of a function by hinting the function name, right?
U087U9YG3 : but if I do
U087U9YG3 : ```(defn ^bytes foo-bytes []  (.getBytes "foo"))

(defn foo-string []
  (String. (foo-bytes)))```

U050MP39D : <@U087U9YG3> I didn't know ^bytes was a valid type hint. I've been using ^"[B"
U087U9YG3 : I get an error
U087U9YG3 : I can use it on arguments and it works fine
U087U9YG3 : ```(defn string-from-bytes [^bytes b]  (String. b))```

U087U9YG3 : gives me no problem
U087U9YG3 : it seems odd that I can use it to hint arguments but not return type
U087U9YG3 : <@U050MP39D>
U060FKQPN : <@U087U9YG3> don't type hint the var name
U087U9YG3 : maybe create an alias that creates an uberjar outside the target folder, then runs lein clean?
