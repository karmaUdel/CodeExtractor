U5CESNHL2 : if anyones interested in lambda -&gt; botkit
U24AT9ZN1 : Check out <#C0HJYTUQ2|events> :wink: Just posted something interesting for bot developers!
U4FSUJLLU : is there an example for a list template for faccebook
U4FSUJLLU : why does it log ```info: ** Invalid X-HUB signature on incoming request```
U04SM6T2H : Hey folks, the BOTNESS group has organized a survey on the types of UI primitives you use and/or want to use in your bots. If you have a few moments, we'd love to get your answers to this survey -&gt; <https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/J9L92LB>
U04SM6T2H : the results will be collected and published by, I believe, Jon Bruner from the Oreilly Bots podcast
U3PCMK1AA : bug? when I get a user info using the api tester, I get an email field in the profile. But if I use the rest api, I don't, everything else is there.
U07CW6N3A : API tester tokens have maximal permissions. Using the web API with standard tokens, you'll need to have the `users:read.email` scope to access that field: <http://api.slack.com/changelog/2017-04-narrowing-email-access|api.slack.com/changelog/2017-04-narrowing-email-access> and <http://api.slack.com/changelog/2016-11-10-addressing-email-addresses|api.slack.com/changelog/2016-11-10-addressing-email-addresses> have more detail.
U3PCMK1AA : Thanks, I thought it would be permission related, but when I saw I could access the phone #, I did not think so anymore :wink:, thanks!
U3PCMK1AA : I already have the scope `users.profile:read`, which, if I'm reading that changelog right should enable me to get the email, right?
U4T0WR6EM : Hi! I have some bot domains available if interested DM me!

U07CW6N3A : I _believe_ that should still grant you access -- at least I wrote that it should back in November! It's possible I mis-spoke and you're the first to notice though :wink:
U4DU4NRL4 : I made a Google Bot for Slack. Check it out @ <https://github.com/MatejMecka/GoogleAssistantSlack>
U4DU4NRL4 : I'd like to know how I can improve it, add new features and more.
U4DU4NRL4 : Also Forks and Stars are appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:
U2Y1XJMB7 : last i read bots cannot delete messages that they didn't post
U04SM6T2H : matejmecka cool :slightly_smiling_face:
U0LLUCLP3 : I love how ProductHunt Tweets out comments as images (no matter how lengthy the comment).Is it possible to make a Slack Bot that adds a tweet button to Slack comments resulting in a similar "image tweet posting" of "Slack comment" if clicked?
Does this already exist? Please discuss.
I am aware of YellowAnt and how great it works at using command lines to do a similar task. 
Example:

U552A39C0 : right but the bot can take the identity of an admin (using his token) and then be able to delete every message.
U5FPB0C9G : has anyone run into users.list returning a 500?
U5D3HQ6R0 : got the error being returned or how are you calling it <@U5FPB0C9G> ?
U5D3HQ6R0 : usually you get a 200 back regardless of an error being thrown iirc
U5FPB0C9G : <https://github.com/slackapi/hubot-slack/blob/master/src/bot.coffee#L56-L58>
U5FPB0C9G : my org is too big
U5FPB0C9G : actually made an issue here &amp; got an indepth reply<https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/issues/343>

U5FPB0C9G : but I'm not really sure what the format of `SLACK_CLIENT_OPTIONS` is
U5FPB0C9G : has anyone used this env variable?
U3PCMK1AA : Trying to use `thread_ts` in a chat.PostMessage. Setting it to the parent ts (which is an interactive message) but it only add the message to the specified channel (<@USLACKBOT>) without adding it in a thread as a reply to the parent message. Any ideas what I am doing wrong here?
U3PCMK1AA : And of course, using the Tester works… Is there special scope to use threads from a Slack App?
U3PCMK1AA : Are threads supported in the Events API?
U07CW6N3A : probably not a scoping issue.. are you sure when you're using `chat.postMessage` via token you're specifying a `thread_ts` that is not itself a reply to another message?
Have you tried using a message that doesn't involve using <@USLACKBOT>?

U07CW6N3A : Yes, there are events about threaded messages available in the events API -- message subtypes `message_replied` being the one you most likely want.
U3PCMK1AA : Yes, the thread_ts is set to the parent ts. When using the same ts in the Tester, it works
U3PCMK1AA : Not sure I understand your last reply. I can't use chat.postMessage in event API?
U07CW6N3A : the events API is just about sending your app "what happened" -- there's no write aspect to it. For write operations, you're meant to use it conjunction with a Web API method like `chat.postMessage`.  
What scopes does the token you're using have? It's possible it just doesn't have the scopes needed to write messages with what you're working with.

U3PCMK1AA : I'm using chat.postMessage, and it's working fine. When adding the thread_ts attribute, it just does not change anything, still working like before, still normal message, not threaded replies
U07CW6N3A : and you're including `thread_ts` as a URL parameter in this case? What's the `channel` field set to and `as_user` value set to? Are you using a bot token or a user token?
U3PCMK1AA : I'm using my Slack App token. as_user is set to false and channel is set to @user (user being whatever user the Slack App is talking too)
U3PCMK1AA : btw, thank you for helping me out here :slightly_smiling_face:.
U07CW6N3A : It _might_ be a quirk with using a @username in that field -- it's a little bit on the edge of typical behavior.   Normal usage typically will use a specific IM/direct message ID there, a channel ID, a private channel ID, or an MPIM ID.
U07CW6N3A : Just to be sure, since it sounds like you're using a user token, what are the scopes you asked for when you made it?
U3PCMK1AA : ```users:read.emailidentify
channels:read
channels:history
channels:write
dnd:read
team:read
emoji:read
files:read
groups:read
groups:history
chat:write:bot
im:read
im:history
mpim:history
pins:read
reactions:read
stars:read
usergroups:read
team:read
users:read
im:write
im:write

pins:write

users.profile:read

users.profile:read```

U07CW6N3A : I'm out of ideas! Our support team might be able to figure it out more deeply for you using more specifics from your team and logs if you want to reach out: <http://api.slack.com/support|api.slack.com/support>  --    it's a little strange it works with a tester token, which makes me think that somehow you're specifying thread_ts in a way that we're just not understanding.    The @username/slackbot approach might also be part of the issue.    Using a bot token instead of the user token might help a lot, but that changes the rules a bit at the same time to only invited conversations.
U3PCMK1AA : ok, thank you. Yes, using the slackbot channel to provide user with info people don't need to see in channel. Can't use channel ID, I tried, but it only work for me, not others, unless I use chatUpdate, which works in that case.
U4MTCT79C : <@U5FPB0C9G> yes - we regularly get `500` errors for users.list requests on some teams. We've got an open support ticket at the moment and Slack have been investigating this for a while. Hopefully it will be resolved soon
U5FF5PHH7 : hello guys i have a doubt
U5FF5PHH7 : can i ask here?
U0K7U9LUC : hello folks. I am trying to invite slacktodo on my team, but it seems it doesn't want to join. Does anyone knows what's going on with it? It used to work very well
U5FPB0C9G : Is there a way to upload images but show them as an attachment?
U0V93GE5R : Removed! ^ Please dont test bots in <#C04SM6TAK|general>
U5CESNHL2 : Where's the best place to announce launching a new facebook chatbot?
