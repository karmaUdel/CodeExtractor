U0JL9RPC4 : maybe you could take a look at something like `<https://github.com/etaque/elm-form>`
U0JL9RPC4 : it could avoid some boilerplate code for complex forms
U604S603Y : wow, there really is a package for everything in elm already oO
U0JL9RPC4 : I already use it and I love it
U41NK9BM4 : <@U604S603Y> Sort of :slightly_smiling_face:
U41NK9BM4 : …and when there isn't there are ports.  But I tend to think to those as a last resort
U5LHS71SM : At first I was going to use socketio library for elm but it does not support elm 0.18 :confused:
U0PBSF05S : <@U5LHS71SM> For what it is worth, I am successfully using SocketIO with Elm by using a thin comm layer, written in JS, that talks to Elm via ports. NodeJS on the server. Working well.
U5LHS71SM : I was doing that, but I'm trying to get rid of that layer. Not for a special reason but I think without that js layer it would be more elegant actually.
U0PBSF05S : True, it would be, but Elm does not support SocketIO directly. I opted for the benefits of SocketIO over straight websockets, but it will depend how you see things in your project. I am not finding that extra layer much of an issue to manage though since I am keeping it thin.
U5P4FLYLE : Hi, I try to manage complexity as my Elm project gets bigger and I split up central Msg. So I have:`Msg.elm`
 ```
   import View.Table as Table
    type Msg                                                                                                                                                                                   
     = Mdl (Material.Msg Msg)  
     | TableMsg Table.Msg
```
Also in update function I have something like:
```        TableMsg a -&gt;                                                                                                                                                                     
             lift .tableModel (\m x -&gt; { m | tableModel = x }) TableMsg Table.update a model
```
In view function:
```
....
      div [class "content"] 
       [ table model record ]
....```

In `Table.elm`
```

U5P4FLYLE : <@U3SJEDR96>  thanks!!!
U5P4FLYLE : Hi, I want to check against specific string value in a function:```   addTableHeadSortable xdim input =                                                                                                                                                   
      case input of                                                                                                                                                                         
          xdim -&gt;                                                                                                                                                                           
            doSomething                                                                                                                                                          
          _ -&gt;                                                                                                                                                                              
            doSomethingElse  ```
So if input equals xdim I want one branch to return, if not otherwise. It is obvious that input as a String can get also different values than `xdim`. But I got compilation error:
```The following pattern is redundant. Remove it. 
79|         _ -&gt;             ^ 
Any value with this shape will be handled by a previous pattern.```
Am I missing something?

U3SJEDR96 : yeah, when you do `case foo of bar -&gt; ` you're essentially asking "can I describe this variable with this pattern", not "with this value". You can use a literal in a pattern, but not a variable, then it will just go "sure, I can put your `foo` in a variable named `bar`", and inside that branch, `xdim` is now your `input` :slightly_smiling_face:
U5P4FLYLE : ok, so how to enforce xdim to be interpreted like pattern? Just use: if else construct?
U3SJEDR96 : <@U5P4FLYLE> exactly :slightly_smiling_face:
U5P4FLYLE : ok, so my last question in this problem would be how to `return` what is in { } in something like that:```      if (input == xdim) {

U0JL9RPC4 : hmm just remove your braces? I don't really get the issue here
U5P4FLYLE : sure in Elm we have `if *then* else`. thanx
U3SJEDR96 : yeah, `if condition then *expression* else *expression`
U3SJEDR96 : remove the braces, add a `then`, and you're all set
