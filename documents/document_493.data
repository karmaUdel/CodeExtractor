U5WD40ZA9 : <@U3SJEDR96> I want to insert a chart with the help of javascript. This requires that the element already exists in the dom before I try to insert the graph.
U3SJEDR96 : ah, so you're using a port, right?
U3SJEDR96 : in your port, defer the actual code using `requestAnimationFrame` :slightly_smiling_face:
U5WD40ZA9 : <@U3SJEDR96> Currently I've been using ports to provide javascript with some data from elm. The problem is that the command I run executes the javascript function before the view is actually rendered.
U3SJEDR96 : yeah, so something like `app.ports.addChar.subscribe(function (chartData) { window.requestAnimationFrame(function () { *add your chart* }); });`
U10P4FNMD : <@U681TBBUP> Create Elm App project is not deprecated, I'm maintaining it with <@U1083HNSF>
U5WD40ZA9 : <@U3SJEDR96> Thank you very much!
U681TBBUP : <@U10P4FNMD> my apologies I was incorrectly referring to this <https://github.com/evancz/start-app>
U10P4FNMD : <@U0JBSEGHY> could you please give me an example of what is not working? Please feel free to hit me with a PM if I could help you in any way :slightly_smiling_face:
U10P4FNMD : No probs! :slightly_smiling_face:
U31FGNWCT : Hi everyone! Has anyone ever used gulp-elm? I'm having an issue with multiple elm files. Can't import one from another, specifically.There is rather big gulpfile in my project, so I'll just show you my elm-task:
```
gulp.task('elm', function() {
   return gulp.src(appSrc.elm)
       .pipe(plumber())
       .pipe(elm({debug: true}))
       .pipe(gulp.dest('someProjectDest'));
});
```

U31FGNWCT : My elm folder currently is pretty simple:```
elm/
----Main.elm
----Ports.elm
```

U3SJEDR96 : Where is your elm-package.json located and what is its source-directories defined as?
U31FGNWCT : As far as I know, gulp-elm handles everything on it's own (and successfully compiles Main.elm, when there are no imports).
U3SJEDR96 : so you don't have an `elm-package.json` anywhere?
U31FGNWCT : it is in example folder of gulp-elm (in node_modules)
U31FGNWCT : confusing
U3SJEDR96 : oh. so in your project root, do `elm-package install --yes`
U3SJEDR96 : then open that file, and set the `"source-directories": [ "elm" ]`
U3SJEDR96 : and then try your gulp thing again :slightly_smiling_face:
