U04SM6T2H : btw the video of the cuttlefish on your site is awesome
U0M7BVC3D : thanks man!
U0LL6RZPS : morning all
U0LL6RZPS : I'm trying to make my bot do something like this: &lt;http://foo.com|click here&gt;
U0LL6RZPS : And make a link. Am I missing something?
U0M880BGA : Mornin'
U0KJ5A91V : <@U0LL6RZPS>: `bot.api.postMessage(messageObject)` will let you do that
U0M880BGA : Does anyone know a good solution for scaling bots on multiple servers?
U0LL6RZPS : <@U0KJ5A91V>: thanks man
U0KJ5A91V : <@U0LL6RZPS>: np
U0LL6RZPS : <@U0KJ5A91V> do you see anything wrong with this?```          bot.reply(message,{
            text: "&lt;https://api.slack.com|test&gt;",
            unfurl_links: true,
            });```

U0KJ5A91V : <@U0LL6RZPS>: if it works then thank *you* otherwise `bot.api.postMessage` :)
U0LL6RZPS : <@U0KJ5A91V>: ^^  I'll try to go direct then. I dug into the Botkit code and it does send this object into bot.api.postMessage so I thought .reply would work similarly. I'm sure I'm making a small mistake somewhere. If I just have the <http://api.slack.com> by itself it makes a link. Thanks for your help. I'll probably just put this issue the shelf for now!
U0KJ5A91V : <@U0LL6RZPS>: I have tried `.reply` before but without the `unfurl_link` option, that didnt work
U0HBN0L9M : both let you do that
U0HKDKHD4 : Hey guys, does the identify scope give current user read? If not is the only way to get a current user read to have a full all team user read? I'd like to just identify and read the current authenticating user.
U0K176R8A : <@U0HKDKHD4> yep at the moment requesting the full team's info is the best you can do if you want the current authenticating user's
U0LP7NBPH : doesn't auth.test give that info?
U0LL6RZPS : Is there an event generated if a person reads/scrolls/sees an individual message?
U0LL6RZPS : specifically on a dm
U0LL6RZPS : Also: What's a best practice for making a Botkit conversation wait until 1) a user clicks a link to a site, and 2) logs in, before continuing the conversation?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0LL6RZPS>: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/general/p1455423948001318>
U0CS6NSF5 : no
U0LL6RZPS : thanks ernesto
U0CS6NSF5 : np
U0CS6NSF5 : :simple_smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : regarding to your second question, you will have to implement the checks o the website to track the link was visited and the user signed in
U0CS6NSF5 : off to sleep now, it's 5am here xD
U0LL6RZPS : morning all
U07HXFWUD : hol
U0LL6RZPS : Two questions: 1) Anyone have any NLP libraries they like? and 2) Are there any frameworks or best practices to abstract the conversation logic from the bot logic if I want to make a bot for multiple networks?
U0HBN0L9M : There's a <http://wit.ai|wit.ai> integration with botkit + an experimental middleware in the works 
U0HBN0L9M : Will try to find links 
U0LL6RZPS : thanks <@U0HBN0L9M> !
U0M9PS5J4 : Hi everybody, I have a doubt. I need to make api request to google maps inside the conversation. How can i do that?
U07HXFWUD : have you tried it?
U07HXFWUD : nothing shoudl stop you, just handle it as an async request
U07HXFWUD : what are the rules around URL formatting?
U07HXFWUD : the examples dont seem to work for me…
U07HXFWUD : ```This message contains a URL &lt;http://foo.com/&gt;
So does this one: &lt;http://www.foo.com|www.foo.com&gt;
```

U07HXFWUD : This message contains a URL &lt;http://foo.com/&gt;
So does this one: &lt;http://www.foo.com|www.foo.com&gt;

U07HXFWUD : By default, messages you pass to API methods and webhooks will be assumed to be pre-formatted based on the above spec. That is, you can include marked up URLs, user links, channel links and commands, but we will still linkify any non-linked URLs present in your message.
U07HXFWUD : sending from the server they dont get linkified. maybe have to be in an attachment and `markdown`' flagged ?
U07HXFWUD : oh, because botkit is using the RTM api by default…
U0LFB8D25 : I used attachments + markdown.
U07HXFWUD : with bot.reply?
U07HXFWUD : The RTM API only supports posting simple messages formatted using our default message formatting mode. It does not support attachments or other message formatting modes. To post a more complex message as a user clients can call the chat.postMessage Web API method with as_user set to true.
U0GRGF85N : Good news everyone! *Statsbot is featured on Slack App Directory!* :innocent::star::star::star::star::star:
