We are a global channel, and no one wants a lack ping notification the in the middle of their evening.```
haha thanks
<@U0KECURAT> fixed!
Hi all, whats the difference between an API token prefixed with xoxs vs xoxp? I mean, can I use the xoxs token like xoxb or xoxp to do api calls?
The token should be good for whatever scopes you requested it for.
I seem to typically get xoxb for my bot users, and I see xoxp for an app I just made, but I'm not sure it's at all related.
`xoxs` tokens aren't typically for developer use. `xoxb` tokens are for bot users. Usually you'll want to deal with `xoxp` tokens when acting as an app, outside of a bot user context and `xoxb` tokens when acting as a bot user.
I share a file from a cloud service at slack and realized that slack used an `xoxs` token to upload the file, and I wondered what is the difference with the others. Thanks.
But right now everything looks ok! So, great!
<@U0HUZ214H> - looks like the BOT BOT problem is not happening anymore! I did nothing so i guess hiccup in EVENTS_API make sense..
Does anyone know how to connect a bot made with flask and python to google cloud sql ?
Hey folks! Recently, Keen IO took over a Botkit middleware I had written for our own bot to officially maintain it. If you're just building out your bot and want to track usage, I thought I'd share it with you:  <https://github.com/keen/keen-botkit> (they literally put it as part of their gh org, which is cool)
I also wrote about the experience here if you're curious: <https://medium.com/@ngardideh/tracking-conversations-with-botkit-and-keen-io-63a9209a12da#.icyg61uwv>
Would love to get some feedback and hope it helps the community :slightly_smiling_face:
Very cool!
<@U0V93GE5R> we should get this listed on the official middleware list :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U3PFQH8BH> good job amigo
danke xD
thanks for the kind words about botkit in there too :slightly_smiling_face:
It's made my/our lives easier – totally deserving :slightly_smiling_face:
:slightly_smiling_face:
<@U3PFQH8BH> added it here ! <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/readme-middlewares.md#keen>
Wicked - thanks!
<@U0V93GE5R> cool! can we get Dashbot added to that list as well please?
<@U0DSTH2HL> Dasbot is added, might want description expanded
I didn't see any better copy to use, if there is a good concise description somewhere let me know. 
Hey all - how does one figure out if a channel is public or private from the API? `channel` object doesn't include it as a value. <https://api.slack.com/types/channel>
look at the id. what letter does it start with?
G is private, C is public
i.e. there didn't used to be private channels, they used to be called "groups"
<@U3FGRUSLT> cool trick - good to know
Guys please advise. My messenger bot suddenly stopped receiving messages attachment such as images and location, it's been exactly 1 hour now. I have been working on Cloud Vision integration for a few hours before was working just fine then suddenly botkit does not receive any messages that contains attachment  (the message is marked as undelivered in Messenger, shows the empty circle). I first thought I had exceeded my Heroku quotas but that s not the case . Do you think the problem comes from FB? where else?
Hi everyone, Scott from Edinburgh here.
<@U3RAA8WSJ> who created you?
I think you should use/create a test channel for such things.
<@U372J18DA> who created YOU?!
<@U2CCKNCLR> I thought my company had spam channels....a channel for testing bots. HOOCHIE MAMA
Your Company? Who is this?
<@U2XP0JPPS> I was just testing the bot! y so much confusion in here?
<@U372J18DA> I'm kidding… :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U2CCKNCLR> again, just joking about my company's slack team
Sorry peeps, was just trying something. Removing it...
please don't "just try something" in 'General', there is a channel for bot testing <#C2HN79VRD|bot-test>
Hey guys do not spam this channel, please. There are several test channels out here for such things.
<@U3PUPSPEV> Always good to see some more of the Edinburgh mafia in bots :slightly_smiling_face:
Uhoh looks like github is down <https://status.github.com/>
Major service outage. It's all comin' up unicorns.
a n g r y unicorns
Disturbingly buff unicorns.
Oh, wait, those are just angry mane hairs. I misread the image.
for reference
looks like its back!
<https://status.github.com/> still says Major Service Outage.
As far as botkit is concerned at least :smile:
Status just went yellow.
Hey guys, I am wondering if there is a way to get the link of a message. i couldn't find any api.
<@U3R45LYJK> What you're looking for is the archive link which looks like this: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/general/p1484329241001645>
Yes, but i want to find a way to retrieve this link for new incoming messages. Do you know if it is possible? the message event api doesn't give me information about this link.
You'll have to create it manually. Syntax is "https://&lt;team&gt;.<http://slack.com/archives/&lt;channel&gt;/p&lt;timestamp&gt;|slack.com/archives/&lt;channel&gt;/p&lt;timestamp&gt;>" (juste remove the . from the timestamp so that 1484329241.001645 becomes 1484329241001645)
ohhhh, thank you so much!
How do you sort the messages getting to your bot. I subscribed to get the event from the channel, but I'd like to make a difference between the one for the bot `@mybot` and the others. Is the only way to parse the text string looking for the `@mybot_user_id`?
or is there a json field I did not see?
probably want to look at direct_mention <@U3PCMK1AA>
