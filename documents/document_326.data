Hi! I have a quick question, If I have```import FirstCall exposing (Model)``` but in my view, I want to rename Model FirstCallModel (because I already have something called Model in my view). Is there a straightforward way to do that?
in other words I want to rename a type a import, is that possible?
<@U5ABF3BH7> I don't think so? I think your better bet would be to not expose `Model` and instead use `FirstCall.Model` or you can `import FirstCall as FC` and then go `FC.Model`
I had done that but I am getting a dependency, and I need each one for the other one. I guess I need to re-structure differently
