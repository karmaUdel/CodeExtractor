hmm, right
so, <https://github.com/elm-lang/html/blob/2.0.0/src/Html/Attributes.elm#L177> has a `boolProperty` function
I think that is what you want to replicate that using <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/virtual-dom/2.0.4/VirtualDom#property>
Mhm... it's not exposed and looks like an internal helper. How would I use it?
replicate it
But I think it will still output quoted value, wouldn't it?
I think it wouldn't
Ok, let me try.
wait, this is for something else, like things that are present or not
like `hidden` or `selected`, that's not what you want right?
Actually this would work too.
