<@U051SS2EU> that's got to be it. I think I just got confused because I'm creating and returning the agent from inside a macro. That's where I see the trouble. If I create a `def` for the return value and then `deref` that it waits just long enough for the last results
there's the function `await`
Thanks, Justin! :slightly_smiling_face:
Oh...actually I didn't realize `await` depends on the `:done` key. I'm using an `int-map` so no keywords...
what?
