U0V93GE5R : You can test what that looks like by dm'ing <@U3NTT2Z3K> `welcome`
U0V93GE5R : or get a list of general topics by messaging `help`
U0V93GE5R : Also I'm proposing some general guidelines, you can read more about them with `code of conduct`
U0KECURAT : <@U04SM6T2H> just dm'ed <@U3NTT2Z3K>, got all of the messages twice :open_mouth:
U04SM6T2H : What the heck!
U04SM6T2H : <@U0KECURAT> can you try again? Seems to have stopped
U04SM6T2H : how weird
U0KECURAT : <@U04SM6T2H> yeah, not happening anymore
U04SM6T2H : weird!
U04SM6T2H : must have been an events api hiccup
U0KECURAT : Yerp, you missed an `s` in the `code of conduct` payload: it says `lack` instead of `slack` (I guess :P)```Do not xxx or yyy pretty much ever
----------------
We are a global channel, and no one wants a lack ping notification the in the middle of their evening.```

U04SM6T2H : haha thanks
U0V93GE5R : <@U0KECURAT> fixed!
U3K6VMKDK : Hi all, whats the difference between an API token prefixed with xoxs vs xoxp? I mean, can I use the xoxs token like xoxb or xoxp to do api calls?
U0HUTFBHS : The token should be good for whatever scopes you requested it for.
U0HUTFBHS : I seem to typically get xoxb for my bot users, and I see xoxp for an app I just made, but I'm not sure it's at all related.
U07CW6N3A : `xoxs` tokens aren't typically for developer use. `xoxb` tokens are for bot users. Usually you'll want to deal with `xoxp` tokens when acting as an app, outside of a bot user context and `xoxb` tokens when acting as a bot user.
U3K6VMKDK : I share a file from a cloud service at slack and realized that slack used an `xoxs` token to upload the file, and I wondered what is the difference with the others. Thanks.
U0HUZ214H : Hey <@U04SM6T2H>, I think you are right about the hiccup, but for a few days I was getting everything twice and it said BOT BOT next to my bot, which <@U3MG94ZJP> and I referenced here: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/botkit/p1483908795000790>
But right now everything looks ok! So, great!

U3MG94ZJP : <@U0HUZ214H> - looks like the BOT BOT problem is not happening anymore! I did nothing so i guess hiccup in EVENTS_API make sense..
U39RDHGBE : Does anyone know how to connect a bot made with flask and python to google cloud sql ?
U3PFQH8BH : Hey folks! Recently, Keen IO took over a Botkit middleware I had written for our own bot to officially maintain it. If you're just building out your bot and want to track usage, I thought I'd share it with you:  <https://github.com/keen/keen-botkit> (they literally put it as part of their gh org, which is cool)
U3PFQH8BH : I also wrote about the experience here if you're curious: <https://medium.com/@ngardideh/tracking-conversations-with-botkit-and-keen-io-63a9209a12da#.icyg61uwv>
U3PFQH8BH : Would love to get some feedback and hope it helps the community :slightly_smiling_face:
U04SM6T2H : Very cool!
U04SM6T2H : <@U0V93GE5R> we should get this listed on the official middleware list :slightly_smiling_face:
U04SM6T2H : <@U3PFQH8BH> good job amigo
U3PFQH8BH : danke xD
U04SM6T2H : thanks for the kind words about botkit in there too :slightly_smiling_face:
U3PFQH8BH : It's made my/our lives easier – totally deserving :slightly_smiling_face:
U04SM6T2H : :slightly_smiling_face:
U0V93GE5R : <@U3PFQH8BH> added it here ! <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/readme-middlewares.md#keen>
U3PFQH8BH : Wicked - thanks!
U0DSTH2HL : <@U0V93GE5R> cool! can we get Dashbot added to that list as well please?
U3F2DBVMY : <@U0DSTH2HL> Dasbot is added, might want description expanded
U0V93GE5R : I didn't see any better copy to use, if there is a good concise description somewhere let me know. 
U36797FQ9 : Hey all - how does one figure out if a channel is public or private from the API? `channel` object doesn't include it as a value. <https://api.slack.com/types/channel>
U3FGRUSLT : look at the id. what letter does it start with?
U3FGRUSLT : G is private, C is public
U3FGRUSLT : i.e. there didn't used to be private channels, they used to be called "groups"
U36797FQ9 : <@U3FGRUSLT> cool trick - good to know
U3C1KGJDD : Guys please advise. My messenger bot suddenly stopped receiving messages attachment such as images and location, it's been exactly 1 hour now. I have been working on Cloud Vision integration for a few hours before was working just fine then suddenly botkit does not receive any messages that contains attachment  (the message is marked as undelivered in Messenger, shows the empty circle). I first thought I had exceeded my Heroku quotas but that s not the case . Do you think the problem comes from FB? where else?
U3PUPSPEV : Hi everyone, Scott from Edinburgh here.
U372J18DA : <@U3RAA8WSJ> who created you?
U2CCKNCLR : I think you should use/create a test channel for such things.
U2XP0JPPS : <@U372J18DA> who created YOU?!
U2XP0JPPS : <@U2CCKNCLR> I thought my company had spam channels....a channel for testing bots. HOOCHIE MAMA
U2CCKNCLR : Your Company? Who is this?
U372J18DA : <@U2XP0JPPS> I was just testing the bot! y so much confusion in here?
U2XP0JPPS : <@U372J18DA> I'm kidding… :slightly_smiling_face:
U2XP0JPPS : <@U2CCKNCLR> again, just joking about my company's slack team
U2VEJ3P2Q : Sorry peeps, was just trying something. Removing it...
U1DM2B4SY : please don't "just try something" in 'General', there is a channel for bot testing <#C2HN79VRD|bot-test>
U2CCKNCLR : Hey guys do not spam this channel, please. There are several test channels out here for such things.
U0CNYC404 : <@U3PUPSPEV> Always good to see some more of the Edinburgh mafia in bots :slightly_smiling_face:
U0V93GE5R : Uhoh looks like github is down <https://status.github.com/>
U3Q8U6MB7 : Major service outage. It's all comin' up unicorns.
U0V93GE5R : a n g r y unicorns
U3Q8U6MB7 : Disturbingly buff unicorns.
U3Q8U6MB7 : Oh, wait, those are just angry mane hairs. I misread the image.
U0V93GE5R : for reference
U0V93GE5R : looks like its back!
U3Q8U6MB7 : <https://status.github.com/> still says Major Service Outage.
U0V93GE5R : As far as botkit is concerned at least :smile:
U3Q8U6MB7 : Status just went yellow.
U3R45LYJK : Hey guys, I am wondering if there is a way to get the link of a message. i couldn't find any api.
U0GT29N3A : <@U3R45LYJK> What you're looking for is the archive link which looks like this: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/general/p1484329241001645>
U3R45LYJK : Yes, but i want to find a way to retrieve this link for new incoming messages. Do you know if it is possible? the message event api doesn't give me information about this link.
U0GT29N3A : You'll have to create it manually. Syntax is "https://&lt;team&gt;.<http://slack.com/archives/&lt;channel&gt;/p&lt;timestamp&gt;|slack.com/archives/&lt;channel&gt;/p&lt;timestamp&gt;>" (juste remove the . from the timestamp so that 1484329241.001645 becomes 1484329241001645)
U3R45LYJK : ohhhh, thank you so much!
U3PCMK1AA : How do you sort the messages getting to your bot. I subscribed to get the event from the channel, but I'd like to make a difference between the one for the bot `@mybot` and the others. Is the only way to parse the text string looking for the `@mybot_user_id`?
U3PCMK1AA : or is there a json field I did not see?
U3H7PR52P : probably want to look at direct_mention <@U3PCMK1AA>
U3H7PR52P : ```Due to the multi-channel, multi-user nature of Slack, Botkit does additional filtering on the messages (after firing message_received), and will fire more specific events based on the type of message - for example, direct_message events indicate a message has been sent directly to the bot, while direct_mention indicates that the bot has been mentioned in a multi-user channel. List of Slack-specific Events```
U3H7PR52P : Can read more about them here <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/readme-slack.md#slack-specific-events>
U3RJJHXGA : Hey guys, I am trying to build a slack app which packages a bot using python. I had to queries that I can't really find the answer for, what is the best way to create N live web socket connections so that the app can support multiple teams. Currently I am looping over the list of tokens stored in a db but for some reach the connection is not established and get this error:  
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/slackclient/_client.py", line 120, in rtm_read
    json_data = self.server.websocket_safe_read()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/slackclient/_server.py", line 138, in websocket_safe_read
    data += "{0}\n".format(self.websocket.recv())
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'recv'

The second concern is how will be the server notified when a new app is authorized by slack. In that scenario it needs to restart the loop over list of tokens when this event occurs. Would you create a cron job that restarts the server or what method would you recommend?

Besides this, would you create separate threads for every rtm connection or bind them to a single process? Anybody else who has an idea about the best architecture for creating bots in python as slack apps, pls suggest the best way forward

U3FGRUSLT : have u thought about using <https://api.slack.com/events> vs. web scokets?
U3FGRUSLT : u can even make your bot always appear online
U3RJJHXGA : yes I had a chance to look at events but i think it is really important for the app to be always connected with the slack channel. It has a lot more flexibility with a downside of scalability issue
U3FGRUSLT : with that setting above it will appear always connected
U3FGRUSLT : to the end users
U3FGRUSLT : but if u want web sockets at scale
