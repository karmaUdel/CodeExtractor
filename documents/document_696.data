Ahh
You know what the `break` statement does?
Terminate 
Terminate what? The whole program?
Inside the loop 
Correct! The break terminates the loop in which it is placed
Glad I remember some of my stuff 
Will try this out 
Another nice question. What's the difference between a *class* and an *instance* ? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
A class consists of objects etc 
And an instance is an object 
I agree that an instance is an object, but not that a class 'consists of' objects.
A template?
Mjah not bad. A *class* is indeed a kind of definition which says what data exists and what methods (functions) there are to operate on it. However, having a *Person* class doesn't give you actual persons. You'd have to _instantiate_ some Person objects and give them names, ages, etc...
And in Python, as well as Swift, we can instantiate objects by calling the class as if it were a function. `fred = Person()` will instantiate an instance of the class Person and have `fred` reference it. In Javascript you have to use `new` to create a new instance of a class.
In Ruby too!
Ahh
So you like learning Python?
I found it more interesting than other languages 
Need to learn so I can be better 
I can analyse data 
Usually use r 
In this case need to use python 
Oh, I never tried 'R'. I was charmed by Python many years ago because of its great data structures and ease of manipulating them. Nowadays I'm also looking into JavaScript (it has become lots better lately) and Clojure and ClojureScript (LISP always fascinated me, so expressive and succinct!).
That's why am using python here 
Easier to just get what I need.
The JavaScript community has even invented *coffeescript* which is a kind of JavaScript but without all the brackets and syntax burden! It uses indentation for blocks of code, just like Python does. Same goes for CSS languages like Less and Sass, and template languages like Jade and Pug.
Need to research it 
As u mentioned earlier, it wasn't really a json file 
Just wanted it to be readable so I can analyse it properly 
I agree that it should be text-only (not binary!) so you can inspect it in an editor
But serialized JSON, everything on one line, is just as useful as XML ;-)
Haha 
I use *pprint.pprint(obj)* to print out objects nicely
Here's the thing. I am working on a paper for my dissertation 
My supervisor said that I won't be judged for code 
Just the analysis as it's about  social media 
So that's why I know it's not unethical to ask 
I helped some PhD's in the past, (for free), maybe I can help you too?
I would appreciate it. Lost a lot of time as my father was ailing from cancer and lost his battle a month ago 
I'm so sorry to hear that. It happened to my grandparents.
<@U69HXQZJ9> Another PhD I helped was about <https://github.com/motoom/farasabina>
Sorry to hear that 
I could help you with the hard programming parts of the data analysis of your dissertation, and the only compensation I ask for is that I can open-source the software on GitHub as a showcase.
Would you be fine with that?
That would be great. I would appreciate it 
Code being open source helps 
Would it be OK after I get my grade?
<@U69HXQZJ9> My email is <mailto:motoom@xs4all.nl|motoom@xs4all.nl> - and I'm glad you agree with me that Open Source is great. It's all for the advancement of Science, no? It is so important that peer reviewers can inspect every step in the scientific process.
Indeed 
Learning should be for everyone 
Open-sourcing your data and methodogies fit in that pattern.
Yes will help others 
Now, Science and Art... I've also done Art projects (for free!) like <https://github.com/luismqueral/jumpcityrecords> for which I did all the programming
Let me check 
<@U69HXQZJ9> I think this is the correct SoundCloud URL: <https://soundcloud.com/jumpcityrecords>
That's quite cool
Too bad Luis is not active on the project anymore, but, interests shift and people move to other things.
True 
At least there is a history of music that was produced by the project :grinning:
That's the best part 
Yes, the Internet (Web?) never forgets things.
Yeah u can't delete it 
Some people try it: <http://lifehacker.com/5958801/how-to-commit-internet-suicide-and-disappear-from-the-web-forever>
Things last 
Even embarrassing tweets 
And why can&amp;#39;t they get their single quotes correct?
*Especially* embarrassing tweets, LOL
Yeah that's what makes me laugh 
My main aim was to understand troll like behaviour 
My supervisor said it was too ambitious and I needed to stick with something on a smaller scale 
But how would you detect 'troll behaviour'?
Yeah that's why he said it was too ambitious :)
But do you have an idea what makes a 'twitter troll'?
So I suggested I crawl four trends 
A person who harasses others and is vile. 
So I crawled them 
I agree, but how do you deduce that from the text of the tweets? You looking for certain troll-words?
Yes and that's why I want to do a word cloud 
Here's what I did 
Ah, I see.
I knew which trends to follow 
Two of them in favour of the govt 
They are a bunch of paid trolls 
Other trends were full of hatred 
My hypothesis is that the same people are taking part in those trends 
Interesting! You begin with a hypothesis, and do work to prove of disprove it. That's the scientific method, isn't it?
...and are you also capable of making predictions after analysis of all teh data?
Like, what people are likely to be trolls? What behaviour is indicative of trolls?
Yes that's the idea 
Well that's why I am going for something simpler 
To detect patterns 
If I have time I can do a sentiment analysis but that would be overkill 
As I am balancing exam preparation and work on the project. Had to defer it because I had to be there to take care of my father 
Ps before they complain, I would move this discussion to private. Too many lines of text here 
That is OK. How do we do that?
Well maybe communicate via dm here?
Alternatively email is also good 
(Discussion moved to private channel)
Any idea to implement array and their operations without using numpy 
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html>? what are you trying to do and why not numpy?
Hello. Does anyone know host django in aws ec2 problem?
I change the allow_hosts in setting, but doesnt work
Really appreciate if some one can help me.
Because I took 2 days still can not figure out what problem.
<@U690F7NJV> give this a shot <https://dryan.com/articles/elb-django-allowed-hosts/>
you may also have to add `.<http://elasticbeanstalk.com|elasticbeanstalk.com>` to your ALLOWED_HOSTS
Thank you <@U07JGLLKF>
I will try
lol......It works. Thank you so much <@U07JGLLKF>
You save my life
:toot:
Sorry, I have one more problem, in django, connect to aws, when ‘eb open', shows Internal server error, 500 error in browser. Does anyone know how to solve it. I google it, but it still can not solve my problem.
Hey everyone.
I've a Django interview coming up in about 8 hours.
Any tips on what I should be looking at? I've only a few months experience with it.
<@U690F7NJV> that usually means there's some sort of issue with the ELB hitting the health endpoint, make sure your ELB health checks are able to hit your server and check your server logs
<@U53MQAY3A> get as much sleep as possible, maybe play around a bit with some Test Driven Development for django
I'm at work, lol
I had a good 5 hours of sleep.
Its 10AM here and the interview is at 6PM
ahh
that's not too bad i guess
if it's a junior position, try and focus on what you've learned in your months with django, try and identify what you're doing well and what you're excited to learn next
ensure you know how testing frameworks interact with django, ensure you know how to write some tests, maybe go over the model and filtering examples again so you're aware of filter chaining and foreign key relationships
What do you guys think? :slightly_smiling_face:
Got you. Thanks <@U07JGLLKF>
<@U5CGPBF0U> first one
there are always gonna be `lat` and `long` params, and this way it looks pretty
hi I have a doubt what is the difference between json.loads(b'byte_string_from_outside') and b'byte_string_from_outside'.decode(‘utf-8') because I read docs and experiment a little bit but is confusing because but seem to work, which one should  go ?
The former will return a `dict` representation of the JSON. The latter just returns a `str`.
in the first case may be returned any type that can be represented in json, not only dict
