```
it should work for deeply nested maps
i know :smiley:  I wonder what lein and boot do
spec?
(I would use it to write tests checking the expected output of an API)
there are a few  options
(for the map thing)
mmh yes specs would work but it seems a bit overkill for what I need
you could just take two maps, the first being the shape and the second being the data and recurse through them
<@U0NCTKEV8> that's precisely what I'm wondering how to do. Is there an easy way to express this recursion procss with stdlib functions?
you can take the description map and turn it to into a sequence of paths and predicates and reduce over that with the data
or to turn it into a sequence of paths
ah, found an example. <http://blog.jayfields.com/2010/09/clojure-flatten-keys.html>
