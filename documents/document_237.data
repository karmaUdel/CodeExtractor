U20R7SEKA : Or if it can be used to respond to what's typed in the menu box? I want to use it to display search results of a sort 
U07CW6N3A : A static collection or one provided in a single external suggestions/options load URL can have up 100 options!
U07CW6N3A : But with the typeahead feature, we'll send you an options load request once a certain number of characters have been typed, that will include the query as a `value`, which you can then use in conjunction with the engaging user, channel, etc. to build a list of 100 options in response to the query. So you can accomplish a search box of sorts that way
U20R7SEKA : Nice! I've got a db of 27,000 records that I'd like to be able to search through using the box so that sounds like it'd work well
U20R7SEKA : Do menus allow for a little icon sized image in them? Or just text? <@U07CW6N3A> 
U28EWD7GW : they allow for emoji as well <@U20R7SEKA>
U20R7SEKA : Hmm, each record has an image URL entry
U4YLQ6ZC5 : Hi there! When i try to install Python Slack Development Kit on my laptop with "git clone <https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient.git>"
"pip install -r requirements.txt"
The second command causes an error: "creating /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/_dummy_thread
    error: could not create '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/_dummy_thread': Permission denied"
Does anyone know what's happening? Thanks!

U4VNZ0TBP : did you try with `sudo`?
U20R7SEKA : When the server sends you information at the options URL, can you just access the json elements as _POST[‘value'] variables?
U20R7SEKA : Can't seem to get the variables:```parse_str($_SERVER["QUERY_STRING"], $query_array);
$args = json_decode($query_array['payload'], true);
$val = $args['value'];```

U20R7SEKA : Any suggestions? Feel like I'm just being a derp
U24AT9ZN1 : You've probably heard Slack rolled message menus this week. It will have a solid impact on workflow improvements within Slack. So we've quickly updated Standuply bot to make daily standup meetings *easier* using message menus in Slack :sunglasses: . <https://medium.com/standuply/how-message-menus-in-slack-improve-daily-standups-25e5750beb63>
U2ATR2KV1 : Hi there! One quick question… How do I get server details like Host, Port etc.. of a server where my bot code is running? I want to get these details when user types some command say.. debug
U4HSMARA5 : Is there a channel related to designing chatbot conversations? E.g. discussing certain conversational principles etc.
U4WKAHM9Q : Hi all - I know this is a botkit team, and I have and continue to use botkit and generally like it. That being said, I was hoping to get an honest appraisal about botkit vs slapp. Has anyone used both?
U0HT1NBLH : Might be worth asking for opinions in the <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> and <#C1XFTGV55|slapp> channels, respectively
U4X5J55E3 : Hey, is anyone online who can help me troubleshoot a bot I'm trying to set up? This is my first time with botkit studio. I've got something set up with glitch, and the bot is showing up as online in my Slack app, but it doesn't respond when I type "hello."
U0V93GE5R : I'm not really online, but check your env file in glitch has all the correct tokens, and your events subscriptions and various urls on the slack side are correct. The starter kit will poot a connected message once everything is correct. 
U0V93GE5R : Now that you can set the status bot for slack to be always online the online button doesn't really mean anything anymore. 
U0V93GE5R : We also have <#C4MJKM145|botkit_studio> if you need more help
U4X5J55E3 : Thanks, Peter. I just figured it out. There were steps in configuring the bot inside Slack that I missed. It's working now.
U0ZEF0ERJ : Hello all, I have a question.Is there any way to get an email address of the Slack user when they use our '/command'?

U0ZEF0ERJ : Hello all, I have a quick question.Is there any way to get an email address of the Slack users when they use our '/command'?

U04SM6T2H : If you have requested the right oauth scopes, you can use the slack API to request that info
U04SM6T2H : however I believe the terms of use on those email addresses is very strict
U04SM6T2H : <https://api.slack.com/methods/users.info>
U0K4TM8N8 : Whomever is behind <@U4S2TQMED> harvesting email addresses from GitHub to then send unsolicited marketing emails is spam and against the law, per my email reply to you just now I've reported your company to the FCC and reported your domain the internet spam blacklists
U0V93GE5R : And of course this is against the terms of this community, so we will be removing that account from this slack. 
U50904YF7 : Hi fellow dev4slack friends, if you could spare 40 seconds, can you please help us answer this 10 questions survey: <https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LZ76TCM>
It will help us design a new product.

U0K4TM8N8 : And whilst I'm in a grumpy mood, <@U50904YF7> what does filling out a financial survey have anything to do with the prupose of this Slack instance, nothing is my answer, so why do you think it acceptable practice to spam our developer community with this garbage?
U50904YF7 : hi <@U0K4TM8N8>: my apologies if you felt this as a spam. we are developing chat bots to help address our perceived void in online lending space and wanted to get feedback from fellow devs
U0V93GE5R : in the future, lets post such things in <#C0JQ4TX7Z|announcements> guys
U4KVBQMU0 : <https://chatbotslife.com/botxperts-asked-with-david-pichsenmeister-of-oratio-dcf65a8abd09>
U5109A5A9 : Hi, I am new to the RTM api (websockets) of Slack. I saw that when a client sends a new message to a channel, the server replies with an ack. However, when the server pushes the message event to the clients (to inform that a new message was posted), the clients are not expected to send an ack. Isn't there a possibility that the clients get out of sync? e.g. in a case of a temporary network failure.
U4S4XCU87 : Hi, Does Slack support a way of creating multiple development / test teams?   (e.g.: in the manner that Facebook supports creation of multiple test users?)  

I am attempting to simulate (and fix) performance/scaling issues that occur with an app, when there are thousands of teams.

U50V26V7W : I am adding a timeout in the slack conversation, so that when the user does not reply on convo.ask, the conversation will end. this works fine, but on the end of conversation, I want to send a message to only the user saying, your session has timedout . I have used the below inside the startconversation, is this the correct way to do it. I am not able the message back to the user, I have used convo.say(). But in my console I see the message timeout. Am I missing something?
convo.task.timeLimit = 5000;
convo.on('end',function(convo) {
    if (convo.status=='timeout') {
        console.log("timeout");
        convo.say("session ended");
}
});

U4T67EY1X : <@U50V26V7W> I've used this instead of on('end': <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/readme.md#convoontimeout>
U4T67EY1X : Not sure if you _can't_ do it your way, but this has worked for me
U50V26V7W : <@U4T67EY1X>  i tried that too, but i get convo.onTimeout is unknown..
U50V26V7W : convo.onTimeout(function(convo) {      ^
TypeError: convo.onTimeout is not a function

U4U6P9L1M : Hey do you guys know if it's possible to have a slider in FB messenger?
U4U6P9L1M : Like the contrast one or volume
U4U6P9L1M : <https://pe-images.s3.amazonaws.com/photo-editing/brightness-contrast/contrast-100.gif>
U0V93GE5R : Maybe using the web view?
U0P3KKXMX : is it possible to export the howdy checkin notes? i'd like people to put jira ticket numbers in and then export them automatically by a bash script
U0V93GE5R : Not programmatically.  You could copy paste them from the dashboard notes page and cleanly post them in a doc. So maybe you could do some sort of selenium script to scrape that?
U0V93GE5R : Either way, data export is a feature we are thinking about for a future update.
U0P3KKXMX : thanks
U52BRS8LW : hi,How to make a bot user get the notifications of a channel?
U4T0WR6EM : anabel: What do you mean by notifications?
U52BRS8LW : When a user writes to respond you need to put your mail, how can I respond faster and without having the mail to whom I will write?
U4T0WR6EM : I'm assuming your talking about slack?
U52BRS8LW : yes
U4T0WR6EM : You can get the users email using the controller.storage method one moment
U4T0WR6EM : ```controller.storage.users.get(message.user, function(err, user) {
	console.log(user);
});
```

U52BRS8LW : where I implement that?
U4T0WR6EM : When your controller matches a pattern ( either in channel, dm, etc... )
U51QR4Z29 : Hey devs! I'm planning to write a serverless slack bot(aws lambda + api gateway + slack integration + events api). I'd like the bot to have private conversation with users. Is there a good tutorial someone here can point me to?
U51QR4Z29 : also is running a bot on lambda possible? (without slash commands)
U3F5HQUF4 : hey is did anybody worked with Slack Interactive messsages, i am unable to get Actions working for those messages
U51QR4Z29 : How do you get slack channel tokens? from UI
U0GT29N3A : <@U51QR4Z29> channel tokens? What do you mean? Tokens are for users (either human or bot)
U4U0J0P4P : Hello guys, my name is chris and i am trying to build  a bot that automates slack group invites... I know these exist but I  want to build it since am new to bot development...
