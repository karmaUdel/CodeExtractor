U5AR0LDQA : So then you can use it in `in` <@U17PWHU4D>
U17PWHU4D : ooh!  nice.  thanks <@U5AR0LDQA> trying that out now!
U5AR0LDQA : You're welcome! :smiley: <@U17PWHU4D> 
U62P4HLCA : I'm banging my head trying to decode a nested json {"error":[],"result":{"DASH":{"aclass":"currency","altname":"DASH","decimals":10,"display_decimals":5}
U4F64AKQV : <@U62P4HLCA> You probably want to use something like `<http://Json.Decode.at|Json.Decode.at>` (<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Decode#at>)
U4F64AKQV : <https://noredink.github.io/json-to-elm/> might also be helpful
U62P4HLCA : ah thanks... I'll take a look
U62P4HLCA : perfect thanks
U5GJ5FEAU : after number of encounters, i think i have figured out json encoding and decoding now :smile:
U5D4VHEN7 : I can't for the life of me get `Debug.log` to work. It doesn't do absolutely anything. I'm calling it like so (to just make sure it is being called):```
main =
    let _ =
        Debug.log "Hello"
    in
    program
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = always Sub.none
        , view = view
        }
```
I am using Webpack with `elm-hot-loader` and `elm-webpack-loader` and the options:
```
{
  verbose: true,
  debug: true,
  warn: true,
}
```
Is there some voodoo I need to do to get this to work? Everything else in my application runs absolutely fine.

U5D4VHEN7 : also:```
    "elm-hot-loader": "^0.5.4",
    "elm-webpack-loader": "^4.3.0",
```

U5D4VHEN7 : Oh goodness, not a Webpack issue at all. Solution was the first response here: <https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/4pzrwd/using_debuglog/>

U5D4VHEN7 : Instead of:```
Debug.log "Whatever, this is just like console.log right?"
```
Do:
```
Debug.log "Some Label:" "Of course not! This is Elm!"
```
Basically, needs two arguments, label and value

U5D4VHEN7 : Confused as to why that doesn't throw a compiler error...
U48AEBJQ3 : Elm has partial application and first-class functions. `Debug.log "Foo"` produces a function of type (a -&gt; a) which you assign to `_` so it gets promptly ignored.
U5D4VHEN7 : Ah, that definitely makes sense. Thanks for the insight <@U48AEBJQ3> :slightly_smiling_face:
U48AEBJQ3 : It could be something that produces a warning, though. You might add an issue on <https://github.com/elm-lang/error-message-catalog>
U5D4VHEN7 : Sweet :slightly_smiling_face: Will do. Given that I spent about an hour smashing my head against that, seems like it could be valuable warnings for beginners
U3LT1UTPF : <@U5XHTBFS6> I'm writing an app with leaflet as the main character. I tried using ports, but after watching richard feldman's talk, I opted for writing a custom element. Not sure if that's convinient for all cases, though.
U3LT1UTPF : <https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ar3TakwE8o0>
U3LT1UTPF : I pass the layers I want as a property
U3LT1UTPF : I plan to extract an example from my code some time in the following weeks.
