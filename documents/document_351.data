Oh that's great thanks!
<@U681TBBUP> yes, it's not like when Angular became The Thing and the whole world would go nuts about it and I just didn't get it, same thing with your state of the art react/redux/immutablejs/reselect/webpack/... stack - I get almost all of that in Elm without the hassle and the brittle modelling and JS
well mostly without JS
I'm particularly intrigued by how it fits together in real time application with something like phoenix on the back end. Since both techs are based on message passing (to some level), combining it with channels seems very powerful
<@U4WH8STNX> would a pr adding the appropriate links to the projects repo be accepted?
That I can not vouch for :slightly_smiling_face:. Maybe have a quick PM with Evan about it. Seems like an instant win-win scenario to me
or just put it on the elm-dev group and see what the response is? <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elm-dev>
<@U681TBBUP> <#C0H8V5YM7|elm-with-elixir> Is a room you could join and chat about elixir and elm together if you haven't already :smile:
Hi, trying to get npm run watch working as per this post <https://maximilianhoffmann.com/posts/how-to-compile-elm-files-on-save> but it keeps complaining it can't find elm (''elm' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.)  If I just do the command (elm make game3.elm --output elm.compiled.js) from the command line it works fine.  Any help?
Are you on Windows?
I am looking at elm-decode-pipeline and the documentation includes an example that uses Json.Decode 3.0.0 wherein there exists a ":=" operator.  Or something.
has := gone away?
and what did it do exactly?
I have tried using := in the repl and the repl doesn't like it
it's an old version
yeah, 5.1.1 seems to be the current.  So := is no more?
no more
with elm 0.18 the direction is to not use custom operators (such as :=)
for the best it seems
hard to keep track of all the operators
they are hard to google for help, confusing, not descriptive...
yeah I'm with you!
:fire: :allthethings:
all the operator things anyways :smile:
I guess the math operators can live...
