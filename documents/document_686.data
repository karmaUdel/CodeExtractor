```
api = Api(app) is registering api with app, no?
Ah, yes, that's right. I guess it's the "you have to register the `api` with your app"...this is what I'm already doing, right? I'm not sure if it was meant that I need to do this (e.g. I haven't done it) or if it's just being stated that I was required to do this...
