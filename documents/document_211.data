U1ZMN2FD1 : anyone have any suggestions for how to deal with this?
U34DV6UG3 : ==GET=SEALD=p=ScAt14QTRXCO4LEzh%UvKg=gHGz0tsZBMad3eYvIi5MHDMiOowQJXt6TF0eoVYBfM7uUCIVWpjWP3EX8wqQ2Y6fFbwqxL2SUzwllNbFpWTK+Nnur7RiTTNHOnLe1nEi%apA/=
U34DV6UG3 : oops, sry for the encrypted message
U0HUTFBHS : Well, the encryption works.  :slightly_smiling_face:
U338CF0AC : <@U272P5K71> Ok, what scope do I need to make the bot post to <#C04SM6TAK|general>? When I try to post I get the error that I need to join the channel. How do I make the bot join the channel programmatically?
U32L2MQ87 : <@U338CF0AC> '/invite @botName'
U338CF0AC : <@U32L2MQ87> programmatically from the slack app's bot user
U316K6HFG : currently listening to this. Nice one. Getting to know about other stuffs like em Purple.
U32L2MQ87 : Hello dear'ies!
In your bot, do you use ES6, or stick to ES5? Any specific reason?
If you're using ES6, what are you using to watch for changes, or do you use a cli tool that transpiles as you run it?

U316K6HFG : I actually used es6 to write the bot for the firm I work with and didn't need some type of transpiler for anything as `Botkit` supports it
U316K6HFG : same for where it'll run ```heroku or beepboop```basic es6 syntax though

U32L2MQ87 : Thanks for the reply! :slightly_smiling_face:Yeah, node partially supports es6, but if you want to use, for example, ES6 imports you have to run through babel or somn'

U316K6HFG : oh, I didn't use es6 `imports`, so I may not know
U322K0W57 : guys, can i ask you a question about the botkit framework?
U316K6HFG : that's what this slack group is for <@U322K0W57> , so why not?
U0KECURAT : <@U322K0W57>  there's also a <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> channel :slightly_smiling_face:
U316K6HFG : yea... <#C0HNPFAF2|botkit-conversations> <@U322K0W57>
U272P5K71 : <@U338CF0AC> bot users can't join channels, they need to be invited - but you can use the user token to invite it if that user's in the channel
U322K0W57 : anyone giving away any invite codes for Botkit Studio? I would love to get to play with that.
U316K6HFG : haha <@U322K0W57> on that already?
U316K6HFG : seems you done with your FB bot
U0V93GE5R : We are starting a private preview, if anyone wants to take a look feel free to dm <@U04S3JCH2> or myself
U0V93GE5R : We will likely start letting in many more people after the Thanksgiving holiday.

U0KECURAT : I feel like I'm missing something ridiculous, I'm having real trouble identifying if a message from the events api is coming from my own bot, I can only seem to get a hold of the bots *userId* not the *botId* -- I thought that should be available when you get the `access_token` in the first place, no?
U1ZMN2FD1 : <@U0KECURAT> i forget the specifics, but note that your bot's message event will appear differently — with different fields — depending on the value of `as_user` when you send the message
U1ZMN2FD1 : it might be that when you do `as_user: false` it has `subtype: bot_message`, but not if you do `as_user: true`, something like that
U1ZMN2FD1 : doesn't solve your problem, but maybe relevant
U0HBN0L9M : this is the most complicated thing <@U0KECURAT>
U0HBN0L9M : I discussed this recently with <@U0D7LHNTX> and <@U2QGELSTS>
U0HBN0L9M : without the benefit of rtm.start, it becomes a PITA when they don't have all the fields in the API response
U0D7LHNTX : I have encountered this too…I need to look up in my code how I dealt with iit :wink:
U0KECURAT : <@U0D7LHNTX> please do! 
U2DSW08UU : Has anyone here ever deploys a botkit chatbot to Azure?
U322K0W57 : <@U2DSW08UU> this might help you: <http://www.stevenfollis.com/2015/04/04/setting-up-a-slack-bot-on-azure-web-apps/>
U2DSW08UU : Sweet thanks man!
U322K0W57 : no worries buddy
U0D1YNBEE : <@U0KECURAT> it's complicated :) this might help add some clarity :grimacing: :point_down: 
U0HBN0L9M : I want to cry and at the same time to hug <@U0D1YNBEE>
U0KECURAT : <@U0D1YNBEE> thanks for that, shame it's nearly impossible to get that info :confused:
U35DKDK8Q : Hello everyone, I just began developing bots on slack, could anyone tell me what is the best way to show the "user / bot is typing..." message near chat input when my bot is writing a message?
U0KECURAT : <@U35DKDK8Q> send an rtm message with `{ type: 'typing': channel: '{channelId}' }` -- ~you might need an `id` in there but I don't think so~ (you don't)
U35DKDK8Q : <@U0KECURAT> thanks will try it out later after work :slightly_smiling_face:
U06E352LU : someone just landed on this team -&gt; :partyparrot:
U0KH7478W : :partyparrot:
U36NU4BBQ : Hello all, i pushed a really cool library on Github to have a welcome bot on our slack communities :wink:
U0KECURAT : <@U36NU4BBQ> cool, a link to it would be cool or maybe some more info :slightly_smiling_face:
U36NU4BBQ : <https://github.com/slugbay/slack-welcome-bot> deployable in 5mn on Heroku :wink:
U322K0W57 : anybody has any multiple conversation threads examples?
U35DKDK8Q : Could anyone advise a worthy bot analytics tool?
U0DSTH2HL : I'll suggest <http://dashbot.io|dashbot.io>, I'm one of the makers. :) 
U35DKDK8Q : Hehe well that's kind of biased although I heard about you guys, is there a demo?
U35DKDK8Q : :grinning:
U0DSTH2HL : Yup! I'm biased, :grinning:. We have a tour at <https://www.dashbot.io/tour> or, I'm happy to hop on a hangout today and give you a live demo, we can chat in DM.. that said, we just passed over processing 200 million messages today, :tada:
U2DSW08UU : Question: If want to deploy node bot to a server. Is it good practice to compile an output for deployment?
U0HUTFBHS : compile an output?
U35DKDK8Q : Hello all, could anyone help with using botkit to show the "user_name is typing..." text in dark grey near slack chat input?
U322K0W57 : <@U35DKDK8Q> you can use bot.startTyping to indicate that the bot is typing, if this is what you are looking for
U322K0W57 : <@U35DKDK8Q> has the same arguments as bot.replyAndUpdate() for example (check documentation to see more: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/readme-slack.md#botreplyandupdate>)
U322K0W57 : there is a bug registered with the Typing... issue: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/507>

U36JH8YTW : Hi, I've a question. I'm trying to setup the event api bot. need verify my url on localhost. The url validator just cannot use my ip address. Is there a bypass for this?
U07CW6N3A : <@U36JH8YTW> some have a lot of success using tools like ngrok to tunnel traffic during development -- whether working with Events API or slash commands or message buttons; here's a tutorial on that: <https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok>
U36JH8YTW : great, thanks
U322K0W57 : can someone please help me with some examples with convo.gotoThread() and/or convo.addQuestion()
U35DKDK8Q : Hey everyone, I would like to know how your collecting feedback from your users once the bot is done, by message / outside link to a website, what are the options and what would you recommend and why :slightly_smiling_face:
U36SE08DA : Hi all! So I've been playing around with a few bot frameworks out there and really keen to get started with botkit... just one thing I couldn't figure out yet.... Is there any *way to integrate a botkit bot on a website/webapp*? We're building a bit to help our business clients. Any while some already use Slack, a lot won't have Slack or even Facebook Messenger and will need an alternative way to access the bot.... I had a look at Smooch and while that looks great, especially since it's built on botkit, I got very confused because it seems to use Slack only for customer service and not for the end user? Some HTML5 chat client would be amazing... any hints on how to get started with that?
U36NAH5HD : Hello. I have bundled my bot into a slack app. How do install the slack app without submitted to the app directory. I want to do this for development before I submit a fully working app for review.
U0GT29N3A : <@U36NAH5HD> It's the same whether the app is submitted or not to the app directory: you need to use the Add to Slack and the OAuth workflow
U0GT29N3A : <https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button>
U36NAH5HD : <@U0GT29N3A> thank you.
U04SM6T2H : <@U36SE08DA>: I just tweeted at ya about this :)
U36NAH5HD : can I use firebase as an action URL for interactive messages?
U36NAH5HD : I would prefer the payload to stored in firebase and have my server look it up.
U36NAH5HD : How do I use chat.update instead of chat.postMessage
U36NAH5HD : ?
U36NAH5HD : I am using interactive messages, and I would like update the existing message with new message.
U322K0W57 : <@U36NAH5HD> Can you show some code so we can see what you are trying to do?
U37C5V3HT : Hello Everyone! Glad to be part of this community. Though I'm not 100% engineer than a UX guy but I love front-end while not designing for people. Recently, I've exploring `botkit` and created a simple chat bot for our another slack community. It's still a baby I would say as I need to work on algo, logics, etc..to make it better. 
Thank you so much for building this community.

U37C5V3HT : My first question is is there a page or a complete `readme` file where I can refer all the functions for `botkit`? As of now, i can only find common references via <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/tree/master>
U2XP0JPPS : <@U37C5V3HT>: I don't believe there is one. Though seems like a worthy project. :)
U37C5V3HT : Yep! I love it <@U2XP0JPPS>
U37C5V3HT : I need some help if you're aware of making such slack bot, and I wonder :simple_smile:
U37C5V3HT : I just posted an issue on github regarding `botkit` that is <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/513>
U37C5V3HT : need some help with a basic one that is how to keep a 4-5 greeting messages and then a bot can reply on random baisis.
U2XP0JPPS : That doesn't seem like a function botkit should supply. But I'm happy to work with you on that
U37C5V3HT : this following code from botkit only..
U37C5V3HT : ```controller.hears(['hi', 'hello', 'good morning'], ['direct_message','direct_mention','mention'], function (bot, message) {  bot.reply(message, 'Hi there!')
})```

U2XP0JPPS : I think that is example code for a specific bot
U37C5V3HT : it's my current bot
U37C5V3HT : yes
U37C5V3HT : as per your understand , how can a bot randomly pick up from a given list of replies…
`  bot.reply(message, 'Hi there!')` like this one has 1 reply

U322K0W57 : <@U2XP0JPPS> Botkit uses Mustache as a templating engine, so its easy to chage messages on the fly even after the messages have been added to the controller
U322K0W57 : let me give you an example
U2XP0JPPS : <@U37C5V3HT> what about doing something like:
U322K0W57 : <@U37C5V3HT> <@U2XP0JPPS> That should work as well
U322K0W57 : i was under the impression he wants to do that in a predefined conversation thread, in which case that would of not worked


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
	If Yes:
	1.Bad	2.Very bad
	If No:
	1.Good	2.Very good


How confident are you?
	1.Low
	2.Average
	3.High

Optional!
can you highlight place/word/sentence which lead to your decision
