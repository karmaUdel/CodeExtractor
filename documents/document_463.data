U0FP80EKB : YOu can do this <https://ellie-app.com/3Kw6DQKfzKPa1/0>
U0FP80EKB : Use `text ""` to not render
U0FP80EKB : oh, my link didn't work
U0FP80EKB : <https://ellie-app.com/3Kwf735ngRWa1/0>
U23SA861Y : *cough* fork *cough*
U0FP80EKB : Here we go
U0FP80EKB : :slightly_smiling_face: I haven't used ellie much
U0FP80EKB : <@U2SR9DL7Q> using `text ""` is a placeholder for nothing <https://ellie-app.com/3Kwf735ngRWa1/0>
U2SR9DL7Q : those look good. The original code is
```
iewBoardCanvas : Model -&gt; Html Msg
viewBoardCanvas model = 
    let canvas =
        Options.div [] [] if model.game == Nothing else 
    Options.div []
        [ if model.game == Nothing then Options.div [] [] else &lt;| text "I'm a canvas!"
        , Button.render Mdl
            [ 0 ]
            model.mdl
            []
            [ text "Start Game" ]
        ]
```

U23SA861Y : yeah, I'm used to the go playground flow
U2SR9DL7Q : essentially, the user should click start game, and the game board should appear.
U23SA861Y : in that case you should have some sort of state variable `type State = Pregame | Playing | Results`
U2SR9DL7Q : Button onclick will eventually do the necessary updates
U23SA861Y : or something and have the view conditional on that
U23SA861Y : rather than just an explicit `showBoard: Bool`
U2SR9DL7Q : game is a `Maybe Game` type so the button triggers to update function that sets up the required state
U23SA861Y : right so you would use a case instead then
U23SA861Y : and do a pattern match
U2SR9DL7Q : I considered case... but I've never used it with a list element... since the only thing changing is one item in the main div's list of Html
U23SA861Y : ```viewBoardCanvas model =
case model of
   Nothing-&gt;
      renderStartGame
  Just game -&gt;
    renderGameBoard game
```

U23SA861Y : case just returns the branches
U23SA861Y : it could be any value even a list
U2SR9DL7Q : Interesting. So Just make them two entirely different view functions
U23SA861Y : sure, the screens are probably going to look pretty different
U2SR9DL7Q : Yes but, can you put a case statement _inside_ a list?
U23SA861Y : you can, but you can also use a let
U23SA861Y : but I would suggest some helper functions, more clear
U23SA861Y : you can also have the case return a list
U3SJEDR96 : you can put a case expression just about anywhere, for Elm, in the end, it's just another expression
