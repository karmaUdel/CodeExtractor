U5YDC1YUW : ah brilliant! good spot :slightly_smiling_face:
U5YDC1YUW : that was leftover crud from when I was using `Time.every second Tick`
U17R26VR8 : yes, you can pass values along with the tick if you want and that’s how you’d do it
U17R26VR8 : `(\_ -&gt; Tick valueToUpdateInASecond)`
U5YDC1YUW : awesome, thanks for your help mate :slightly_smiling_face: got myself a working timer!
U17R26VR8 : My task is complete. I shall go back to work.
U5YDC1YUW : :sunglasses:
U5YFL1QNB : Hi folks, I'm hitting some 404 errors while downloading elm through npm install

U5YFL1QNB : Is anyone else having these difficulties?
U5YFL1QNB : Ah! The issue is caused by the new package-lock.json
U17J54S2U : Yeah I’ve encountered so many errors when I upgraded to node 8 and npm 5, I just downgraded to LTS 6 and npm 4.
U0EUHKVGB : <@U5YFL1QNB> That seems very strange, can you open an issue forit here? <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform>
U5YFL1QNB : Will do
U5YFL1QNB : <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-platform/issues/210>
U0EUHKVGB : <@U5YFL1QNB> Can you amend it to have the smallest possible reproduction steps?
U5YFL1QNB : Done
U5YFL1QNB : Let me know if that's OK with you, otherwise please point me in the right direction
U0EUHKVGB : <@U5YFL1QNB> Think about it in terms of all the things you need to make the error happen again.
U0EUHKVGB : You need to provide an example `package.json` file, for example
U0EUHKVGB : See this: <http://sscce.org/>
U0EEGSF35 : been writing way to much js and jquery last 1/2 year.
U0U6ML22H : I encountered a problem, using Html.form and an input and a custom "on blur" event: the submit event is fired before the blur event, so my model is not updated properly. Anyone has an idea of how I could circumvent that? Thanks :smiley:
U3SJEDR96 : assuming this is related to the cursor jump thing, you might want to try this workaround instead <https://github.com/elm-lang/html/issues/105#issuecomment-309524197>
U1D7SLE4Q : <@U0U6ML22H> I don’t know much about your case, but probably you could run the “on blur” handler inside the “on submit” handler?
U3SJEDR96 : you don't have access to the field there
U0U6ML22H : <@U1D7SLE4Q> unfortunately, I wouldn't get the value from the on blur event
U0U6ML22H : yeah, what <@U3SJEDR96> said :smiley:
U1D7SLE4Q : meh(
U0U6ML22H : <@U3SJEDR96> thanks for the link to the issue; the problem here is that we need to use "on blur" because... our behat tests don't seem to work with onInput
U0U6ML22H : I know, it's gotta be the lamest reason ever to use blur over onInput
U0U6ML22H : <@U1D7SLE4Q> thanks for trying to help :smiley:
U5DJNFLUD : Anyone have experience using ports with file uploads? Is <https://www.paramander.com/blog/using-ports-to-deal-with-files-in-elm-0-17> still a good approach?
U0U6ML22H : <@U5DJNFLUD> that's what we're currently doing
U5DJNFLUD : <@U0U6ML22H> Cool thanks -- I need to process some CSV files
U0U6ML22H : we're just using it to turn files into base64 and send them to the server like that; it works mostly fine
U0U6ML22H : bear in mind that file processing is asynchronous, so you should watch out for that
U5DJNFLUD : Yeah makes sense
U5DJNFLUD : Thanks though
U0U6ML22H : sure
U3SJEDR96 : I think I have something highly similar as an ellie, somewhere
U3SJEDR96 : <https://ellie-app.com/3qpgdbQFFfqa1/0> yep :smile:
U40QW928G : Are there any elm tutorials on forms?
U40QW928G : like input type=text and selects, checkboxes, etc
U0J1M0F32 : <@U3SJEDR96> I'm sad you can't just shove that base64 string into the src attribute of an image tag.
U3SJEDR96 : <@U0J1M0F32> that was laziness on my side - <https://ellie-app.com/3qpgdbQFFfqa1/1>
U0J1M0F32 : :eyes:
U0J1M0F32 : I did that and it didn't work for me. wat.
U0J1M0F32 : Ah, I see the change you made :thumbsup:
U40QW928G : for modules is there an equivilient to like __init__.py?
U40QW928G : like if I make a folder called, `Players` is there a file I can make where I can then import stuff like models via `import Players exposing (Player)` ?
U0H3A9XLN : <@U40QW928G> you can: import Players.Player as Player
U3LUC6SNS : Regarding the infamous "jumping cursor bug":  I've been converting my app to use the `style-elements` package and have this snippet:```
named "content"
            (EL.textArea None [ padding 8, EE.onInput InputContent ] (model.current_document.content))
```
Strangely (and wondrously), text input in this element, according to my first tests, does not suffer from the bug -- no need to use `defaultValue` etc. 

I don't have an explanation for this.  Will inform <@U0JFXEUCT>  at `style-elements`

U5AQ585NH : Just finished a preliminary version of multiselect control in pure elm: <https://inkuzmin.github.io/elm-multiselect/> (repo: <https://github.com/inkuzmin/elm-multiselect>)Any suggestions or comments are very welcomed!

U0JFGGZS6 : ^ <@U5ABF3BH7>
U1AN4JRFV : good evening, gentle people! :tophat: let me see how condensed i can ask this...: my JSON contains URLs to imgs, but they're 404, so I do `onerror setAttribute`.
U1AN4JRFV : i am looking for a more elmish and beginner-friendly way.
U0LPMPL2U : I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do
U0LPMPL2U : you're validating that the URLs aren't dead as part of decoding?
U1AN4JRFV : i have a view, where I show an image with an url that does not exist (404)
U1AN4JRFV : no, I don't. is that what you would suggest?
U0LPMPL2U : not necessarily :slightly_smiling_face:
