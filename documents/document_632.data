U5YKRLXGT : Ok, hang on  - let me try and explain this again one more time :slightly_smiling_face:
U5YKRLXGT : Ignoring the CSS part, which I think is a bit of a red herring
U5YKRLXGT : I have a view
U5YKRLXGT : As it builds up the virtual dom, I would like to accumulate some state
U5YKRLXGT : that I can then append in a new node at the end
U0EUHKVGB : What state?
U5YKRLXGT : In this case, CSS rules :slightly_smiling_face:
U0EUHKVGB : What do you mean by “builds up the virtual dom”?
U5YKRLXGT : Ok, so:
U5YKRLXGT : This guy:
U5YKRLXGT : ```view model =    div []
        [ h1 [] [ text "Hi" ]
        , console [ Html.Attributes.id consoleId ] [ text model.lines ]
        , button [ onClick (Send "Hello") ] [ text "Append" ]
        ]
```

U5YKRLXGT : The console function is actually a styled div
U5YKRLXGT : Inside that function, it's generating some namespaced css rules
U5YKRLXGT : but I don't want to create a &lt;style&gt; tag for every styled component - I could, but it would be nasty
U0EUHKVGB : So, two questions:- Why do you think it would be nasty?
- What is the type of the console function?

U5YKRLXGT : Doesn't IE have a hard limit on the number of style tags you can have in a document for starters?
U5YKRLXGT : Console looks like this:
U5YKRLXGT : ```console =    styled Html.pre
        [ padding (em 4)
        , backgroundColor (hex "000")
        , color (hex "fff")
        , height (px 300)
        , overflowY scroll
        ]
```

U2LAL86AY : is not clear why this can't be  done using just function application. console is a specialized version of some div - with styles applied. is it not?
U0EUHKVGB : <@U5YKRLXGT>, what is the _type_ of that function?
U5YKRLXGT : It returns a `-&gt; Html.Html msg` right?
U5YKRLXGT : I literally started programming Elm today :slightly_smiling_face:
U0EUHKVGB : No, I don’t think it does.
U5YKRLXGT : In another language I might do this:
U5YKRLXGT : ```view model =
    stylesheet (\css -&gt;
        div []
            [ h1 [] [ text "Hi" ]
            , css `console [ Html.Attributes.id consoleId ] [ text model.lines ]
            , button [ onClick (Send "Hello") ] [ text "Append" ]
            ]
    )
```

U0EUHKVGB : Depends on the type of that `styled` function.
U5YKRLXGT : and have `css` evaluate a literal and then save the rules into a list
