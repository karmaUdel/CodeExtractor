it could be written like ```(or (somefn x) y)```, but inside somefn there definitely would be repetitions of x or % argument
you have three values you care about, `x,` `y`, and `(some-pred? x)`, so you will need those three elements. if x is truthy, you could write the pred to return x or false and use `(or (some-pred? x) y)`, though that means custom predicates.
Doesn't work if you need pred to succeed on x being false / nil though
