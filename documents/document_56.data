```
it's not the keys, that's just not a valid place for a type hint
<@U11BV7MTK> yes that's correct
see my follow up
ah ok. i thought you were still attributing it to the `:keys` destructuring
my bad
<@U3L6TFEJF> - I ended up using postwalk with core.match
<@U0564EGNY> nice! mind sharing the solution?
I suppose the map should be mapv
hmm, not sure how this is actually working without that :wink:
oh, and the outer seq needs to be there because our tree may have multiple paths, duh
ok, I have a bug when adding another path in the tree. I'm flattening at the wrong place
