Spend a lot of time, and can't find solution:disappointed:
Looks like you are trying to access the MySQL server through the socket, I think you need to set it to use the port and the hostname `my-db` (or whatever `link` arg you name)
something like this?
No, it's what you link it as, so the `docker run --name=test-app -p 8000:8000 -it -v $PWD:/app --link my-db --env-file=.env myapp:dev` The `--link my-db` would name the link `my-db`
So I think you need to change your mysql connection string to be looking at the port, not a local socket
this one;)? sorry, I :disappointed:confused
that looks invalid, `--link` requires an argument
I am saying, just use what you originally posted, but in your app code where you connect to the database, use the hostname `my-db`
What lib are you using to talk to your DB?
mysql-python
