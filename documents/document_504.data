U4872964V : yes, that's what I meant by if the model actually has those fields. however, you still tie your function to your model when you do that. Refactoring the model will lead to refactoring your function. Which is ok, by the way :slightly_smiling_face:
U4872964V : depends on what function we are talking about i suppose
U153UK3FA : yep, it can certainly be over used. You probably don't want to do it more than a few calls down
U2D07QZN3 : I have a list of records with a "name" field.  How do I filter get a new list, where name contain a string?
U153UK3FA : `List.filter` is the function you want
U153UK3FA : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/List#filter>
U3SJEDR96 : I think you actually want `List.map (\record -&gt; record.name) records` or - shorter yet - `List.map .name records`
U3SJEDR96 : It's a little hard to make out what you're actually after. Perhaps you could give an example of the input and what you'd like the output to be?
U153UK3FA : `List.filter (\record -&gt; String.contains "pizza" record.name) records` will give you a list that only contains records with names that contain the word "pizza"
U2D07QZN3 : that's it, thanks!
U37HUSJ4R : If I have a 
```type Status
    = Open Time
    | Closed

type alias Time =
    { open : Int
    , closed : Int
    , message : Maybe String
    }

data : List Status
```
and I want to update a `Status` record on `data` I have a function that gets me the record I want to update, but how do I then update a union type? obv `{ record | closed = 1 } ` is incorrect

U37HUSJ4R : where `record` is a `Status`
U0ULRASLC : <@U37HUSJ4R> Hm your question is a bit confusing. Is it correct that you want to change your definition of the Time-record to where `closed : Int` becomes `closed : Status`, and after doing so you wonder how to update that field in the record?
U0ULRASLC : ah nvm. I see what you mean now I think. I miss read the code a bit
U0ULRASLC : What is the difference if a Status is Closed and when a Status is Open but has a Time-record with closed  = 1 ? If they mean the same you could remove one of them
U0ULRASLC : if you have a function that takes a Status and only updates the field closed if the Status is open you could write it like this```
updateClosedFieldIfOpen : Status -&gt; Int -&gt; Status
updateClosedFieldIfOpen status newClosed =
  case status of
    Open time -&gt;
      Open { time | closed = newClosed }
    Closed -&gt;
      Closed
```
But then again I'm not sure I understand what you want to do :stuck_out_tongue:

U31FGNWCT : Hi everyone! When you send JSON array of objects to elm does it convert it to something? I've got a runtime error like this (cut, it's a lot longer):```
Expecting a String but instead got: [{"id":2,"name":"Administrator","code":"admin","description":"Administrator","permissions":["
```
Trying to decode it with this:
```
type alias Row =
    { code : String
    , description : String
    , id : Int
    , name : String
    , permissions : List String
    }

thatDecoder = Decode.map5 Row
                (Decode.field "code" Decode.string)
                (Decode.field "description" Decode.string)
                (Decode.field "id" <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
                (Decode.field "name" Decode.string)
                (Decode.field "permissions" &lt;| Decode.list Decode.string)
thatListDecoder = Decode.list thatDecoder

main : Program String Model Msg
...
init = (\flags -&gt; (Result.withDefault [] (Decode.decodeString thatListDecoder flags), Cmd.none))
...
```

U153UK3FA : <@U31FGNWCT> You don't actually need to decode that, Elm will do it for you
U153UK3FA : <https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html>
U31FGNWCT : So I just pass it as flags without decoding?
U153UK3FA : yep
U31FGNWCT : Well, that's pretty convenient!
U31FGNWCT : Thank you, Ill try that.=)
U31FGNWCT : Haha! Awesome! Thank you very much <@U153UK3FA>!
U601ELFEG : Hmmm... In order to use Bootstrap tooltips, you have to do some JS initialization on the DOM elements after they are created. Does Elm have a JS hook after the DOM has been created or updated?


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
	If Yes:
	1.Bad	2.Very bad
	If No:
	1.Good	2.Very good


How confident are you?
	1.Low
	2.Average
	3.High

Optional!
can you highlight place/word/sentence which lead to your decision
