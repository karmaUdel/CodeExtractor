    -&gt; Node msg```
You’re going to have a bad time if you keep trying to think of things in terms of mutating away and doing everything to avoid boilerplate
So that code isn’t even 0.17
OH, sorry
I added the signal earlier
haha
that's what led me here
Ignore that part :slightly_smiling_face:
NOT HELPING :slightly_smiling_face:
haha, sorry
I don't think transforming a tree is particularly naughty - it's still pure
That type signature does not make sense to me still. By property do you mean `Attribute msg`?
Or is it some custom type the library uses?
<https://github.com/styled-components/elm-styled/blob/master/src/Styled.elm#L658>
Is that helpful?
Should take you straight to the line
I see, so it’s a custom type they’ve invented.
Let’s take a step back: Why are you trying to use this library?
`import VirtualDom exposing (Node, Property)`
It's just a `VirtualDom.Property`
Yes
I'm using the library because it handles hashing the contents of a stylesheet to create a namespace, which elm-css does not (yet)
and because I think it could be wicked cool if I can get it to collect all the rules, emit one style at the end and leverage the virtualdom to no-op if no styles have changed
No weird external build process, just pure elm
The virtualdom will already do that for you.
Yes, exactly :slightly_smiling_face:
This is premature optimization for sure.
I'm not saying I will do that - I'm saying it does that :slightly_smiling_face:
There is no need to collect all the rules, is what I am saying.
If I don't collect the rules, I have to emit one style per element:
I’ve benchmarked it :wink:
