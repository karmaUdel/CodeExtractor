U0JBSEGHY : I think it would be relatively easy if there was an `oncut` event like there is in JS. But there doesn't seem to be these events in the Html.Events of Elm
U3SJEDR96 : well you can always `on "cut" decodeTheEvent`, though I'm not sure what information you'd decode from it
U3SJEDR96 : other than "it happened"
U0JBSEGHY : I had tried that.. But it didn't seem to work. I will try it again
U4872964V : are you catching the "input" or "change" events?
U4872964V : wouldn't input be triggered if you paste?
U3SJEDR96 : Important to know - if the decoder fails, it will simply do nothing
U3SJEDR96 : but yeah, I'd think input and change would be triggered, though if you're basing things on keyup, it might start to get weird
U0JBSEGHY : yea input overrides the keyup. I will have a look at change. I wasn't aware of this event
U0JBSEGHY : for reference this is where I am at
U0JBSEGHY : VIEW ```[ input                        [ --onInput FormatNumber
                          onChange HandleField
                        , value model.numberToCall
                        , placeholder "Enter a Phone Number"
                        , class "login-form"
                        ]
                        []
                    ]```

U0JBSEGHY : ```onChange : (( Int, String ) -&gt; Msg) -&gt; Attribute MsgonChange handler =
    let
        toTuple =
            JD.map2 (,) keyCode targetValue
    in
        on "keyup" (JD.map handler toTuple)```

U0JBSEGHY : UPDATE ```        HandleField ( key, digits ) -&gt;            if (List.member key [ 8, 46 ]) then
                ( { model | inputField = digits }, reformatNumber digits )
            else if (List.member key (List.range 48 57)) then
                ( { model | inputField = digits }, formatNumber (String.right 1 digits) )
            else
                model ! []```

U4872964V : why aren't you just using the input event?
U4872964V : why keyup?
U0JBSEGHY : Each time a number is added it is sent through a port to be formatted
U4872964V : yes, but input will trigger each time you write a number
U0JBSEGHY : it also triggers each time I do anything else
U0JBSEGHY : so a backspace will trigger it to send the last character of the string through the port. This then comes back and instead of backspacing the last number I duplicate it :confused:
U4872964V : well, you'd have to compare the input to what you have in your model i suppose
U4872964V : so you are sending a character at a time to the port? why don't you send the whole input
