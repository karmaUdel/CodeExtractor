```
I don’t understand your problem, why do you want to call Task.perform?
On Press is a specific key is pressed…
I’m sorry, I don’t understand what the problem is
`Task.perform (always Prev) (Task.succeed Prev)`
this works but in a wrong way
but why do you want to call `Task.perform`?
That’s for running tasks as commands
