<@U2W6RTGQH> `Html.Attributes` is just a module name. It's nothing that lives in the `Html` module. They are completely unrelated (except that one may import the other).
<@U0LPMPL2U> <@U4872964V> thanks
Does anyone know why i'd be able to `curl <http://localhost:8000>` when using `elm-reactor` but when opening in the browser it just refuses to connect/times out?
Hey everybody, is there an easy way of changing pixel values in a `&lt;canvas&gt;`?
have you looked at <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-graphics/1.0.1/Collage> <@U1C5N3NUD> ?
As with HTML, you don't mutate the canvas but instead re-render based on a different model state
Ah yep it looks like Collage is what I'm looking for
<@U0LPMPL2U> yeah I just need to change individual pixels on state change
You'd define a view function that takes in a model and renders the desired pixels
now when the model changes, the pixels will too
<@U218QNMR8> the only thing that comes to mind is browser specific proxy settings. Have you tried on a different port? (`elm-reactor -p 5050` for example)
got it :thumbsup:
yep - i've been using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` on the same port as a workaround
i've tried removing all traces of elm and reinstalling
on the same port? that should not be possible
correct
i mean - i'm not using them both at the same time, but it makes no difference to the python server whether or not `elm-reactor` is running or not (on the same port)
<@U0CLDU8UB> yeah, I've had wonky things like that happening too, tbh - elm-live + elm-reactor = weird :wink:
fixed it
i had some weird stuff in `/etc/hosts`
okay good
