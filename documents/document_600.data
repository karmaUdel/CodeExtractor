U0JFGGZS6 : it only runs the validation on submit, not as you type or as fields lose focus, but wouldn't be hard to adapt to those scenarios
U0JFGGZS6 : ^ <@U5ABF3BH7>
U5ABF3BH7 : @ericgi Thanks, I will take a look at that one
U5ABF3BH7 : @ericgi The elm-spa-example just says import Validate in the file, so I am not sure which package that is, do you know?
U5ABF3BH7 : Does anyone have more complicated examples of validation, like a phone number validation?
U1AN4JRFV : <@U5ABF3BH7>,  it's the one by rtfeldman. you can check the file `elm-package.json` to see the dependencies
U5ABF3BH7 : <@U1AN4JRFV> Good idea. Thanks!
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U5ABF3BH7> I hadn't used `rtfeldman/elm-validate` before, so I whipped this together. <https://ellie-app.com/3VjPSny6pjFa1/0>
U5ABF3BH7 : <@U48AEBJQ3> Thanks
U1RJZ6SEL : The list would change sparingly, agreed. Still, I'd love to know how to do this as a learning exercise! Would it be helpful to assume for now that the list of available people number 500k and thus is too large to download in full and filter client-side?
U1SF6G7PA : i never did sth like this, but i guess if its so many people you probably only want to fetch the users if you have typed in some letters. you could have `onInput UpdateQuery` on the textfield and then in your update do sth like```

U5ABF3BH7 : <@U48AEBJQ3> can you tell me why you used ``Validate.eager`` and in what case I should use it? Is there any documentation about ``ifInvalid`` function? Also, my input already has a message as it is a field of my record. How can I add the validation and still keep my message?
U1SF6G7PA : `case msg of UpdateQuery query -&gt; ( model, if length query &gt;= 3 then (fetchPeople query) else Cmd.none )`
U1SF6G7PA : where `fetchPeople : String -&gt; Cmd Msg` is your http request
U1SF6G7PA : so its sth like `fetchPeople = Http.send LoadPeople (Http.get ("yourbackend/fetch/" ++ query) decodePeopleList)`
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U5ABF3BH7> `Validate.eager`stops at the first error it gets. Sometimes multiple errors aren't useful because later errors are dependent upon earlier ones. In this case, I don't want it to even check if the input is a valid integer if it is blank.
U48AEBJQ3 : The documentation for `isInvalid` is pretty sparse <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rtfeldman/elm-validate/1.1.3/Validate#ifInvalid> but it is a helper for making your own `Validator`s.
U1SF6G7PA : and `LoadPeople` is the msg which handles the incoming list of people, i.e. your msg look like `type Msg = UpdateQuery String | LoadPeople (Result Http.Error (List People))`
U1SF6G7PA : i hope thats understandable? :slightly_smiling_face:
U48AEBJQ3 : Store the output of the validation as an extra field in the model would be the easiest way.
U2Z0RF6CW : Is there any way to get the response header and decode the response body when using `Http` package?
U2Z0RF6CW : I was looking into the snippet <https://ellie-app.com/3prFNXVLfdSa1/0> which is extracting header
U2Z0RF6CW : Can someone help to decode the json along with the request?
U1RJZ6SEL : Hmm, I think? Would I be sending `fetchPeople` in parallel with handling `SetAutocompleteState`, from the elm-autocomplete example?
U1SF6G7PA : no, the setautocomplete msg is just the necessary boilerplate to hook up the autocomplete messages into your main update function
U1RJZ6SEL : Right, but I have to update my local state while I'm waiting for my remote request to come back, though. I guess I'm just not understanding the sequencing.
U5ABF3BH7 : <@U48AEBJQ3> Thanks, I get it now. That was super helpful!
U1SF6G7PA : let me write an ellie :slightly_smiling_face:
U1AN4JRFV : <@U2Z0RF6CW>: do you mean to combine getting the header and the json body, or do you just need to decode the json response? (the body)
U1AN4JRFV : step 1: define a record structure to hold the data: ```type alias Post = { userId: Int, id: Int, title: String, body: String}```
U1AN4JRFV : (nicely formatted, of course)
U2Z0RF6CW : <@U1AN4JRFV> I just need both header &amp; body information to be updated on the model.
U3SJEDR96 : <@U2Z0RF6CW> as it happens, <@U0F7JPK36> made a package earlier today that helps with that
U3SJEDR96 : checkout lukewestby/http-extra <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/lukewestby/http-extra/2.0.0/Http-Extra#expectJsonResponse>
U1AN4JRFV : ok, then i suggest returning a tuple from that getHeader-function (name questionable).
U0F7JPK36 : wow what are the chances
U3SJEDR96 : :smile:
U3SJEDR96 : You chose a pretty good time to release that, <@U0F7JPK36> :heart:
U0F7JPK36 : well i started it right after the first question about that
