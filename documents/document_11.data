a slightly better version would be e.g. ``` (defmacro a-macro [name] `(defn ~name [] (a-fn*)))``` but still, this doesn't look like a very useful macro
they have their uses, probably finding out what is the goal is a step to take before judging something as not idiomatic
why would you intern a var in a namespace that just delegates to a var in another? just refer that one directly
coming off as judgmental was not my intention, if that's how it came across
