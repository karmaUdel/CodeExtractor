```(s/def :q/o odd?)```
so the way s/* can tell it is done matching is something fails to match
yeah, odd? isn't total

(s/and number? odd?)
what do you mean by "total" ?
I suspect the problem here is that `s/+` is a regex matcher, not a collection matcher...?
<@U0CKDHF4L> <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotalFunction.html>
Change `:q/b` to `(s/coll-of even?)`
(you can specify a minimum length of 1 to require at least one element)
that'll be the next issue, which will get him a weird failing spec
right now the error from feeding a non-number to odd? is bubbling out and killing the checking
Ah, I see where you're going now. I was jumping ahead.
<@U0CKDHF4L> "total" means "defined for all inputs"
`even?` and `odd?` are only defined for numeric inputs.
Hence <@U0NCTKEV8>'s suggestion to use `(s/and number? odd?)`
