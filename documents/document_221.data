U04SM6T2H : right
U04SM6T2H : you first have to log in and get the token
U04SM6T2H : via oauth
U04SM6T2H : another way to do it
U04SM6T2H : fwiw
U04SM6T2H : would be to limit logins to a specific team ID
U04SM6T2H : which you will have once you log in the first time :slightly_smiling_face:
U3PCMK1AA : good hint on removing the endpoints later though or limit the logins to a specific ID. I'll definitely want that, will try first with the team ID
U04SM6T2H : :thumbsup::skin-tone-4:
U0D1YNBEE : :wave: Hi everyone, happy Monday! I just wanted to let you know we just launched a new scheduling API (think cron-as-a-service webhooks) and a key/value persistence API for <@U2RNTQRN3> <https://blog.beepboophq.com/new-scheduling-and-data-apis-for-beep-boop-98c2afcb5b62#.rx0u3nazb>
U3PCMK1AA : Having problem getting post request from the events API. I created an Slack app, authorized it sending the GET requests manually ```<https://teamnameyyy.slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&amp;scope=bot>``` and sent (manually) the oauth.access GET request to get the token ```<https://slack.com/api/oauth.access?client_id=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&amp;client_secret=yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy&amp;code=zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz&amp;pretty=1>``` but I'm still not receiving any POST request to my redirect url I configured in the app. Any ideas?
U3PCMK1AA : I got the same kind of respond that the one in the doc ```{    "access_token": "xoxp-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXX",
    "scope": "incoming-webhook,commands,bot",
    "team_name": "Team Installing Your Hook",
    "team_id": "XXXXXXXXXX",
    "incoming_webhook": {
        "url": "<https://hooks.slack.com/TXXXXX/BXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXX>",
        "channel": "#channel-it-will-post-to",
        "configuration_url": "<https://teamname.slack.com/services/BXXXXX>"
    },
    "bot":{
        "bot_user_id":"UTTTTTTTTTTR",
        "bot_access_token":"xoxb-XXXXXXXXXXXX-TTTTTTTTTTTTTT"
    }
}```

U3FGRUSLT : what events are u listening for?
U3FGRUSLT : <https://api.slack.com/apps/yourid/event-subscriptions>
U3PCMK1AA : events subscription is set to <http://message.im|message.im> and team_join for bot events
U3FGRUSLT : and this:
U3FGRUSLT : green verified?
U3PCMK1AA : yes
U3PCMK1AA : Does the bot need to start the communication, or should it just get post request events right away?
U3FGRUSLT : "a message was posted in a direct message channel"
U3PCMK1AA : tried to send a DM to the bot, but nothing arrived on the other side ;(
