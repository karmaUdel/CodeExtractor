B: Great, a list of barbeque restaurants are…```
<@U055FHACC> yup, understood, thats why you would need to use refs to be sure
That's nice. We forget about the first one when a the conversation takes a new direction, for the sake of simplicity. We found that it could cause more confusion than help
yeah, I may let customers set the number to remember on a case by case basis for that reason, as it can cause confusion
brave new world :simple_smile:
I would look to text adventure games
There are 2 things to accept 
You say accept 
Bot says sorry accept Ben or accept Eric 
"I would look to text adventure games" whoda thunk it
Free Beer to the first person to create Hunt The Wumpus as a Slack Bot... :wink:
Another cool article about bots!

what will they eat when they're done with the web?
if they start to eat our tacos, you know we're doomed
anyone played around with using a state machine to track multiple conversations?
for the "accept / decline" invitation example, if the bot knew that there were two open invitations that need a reply, then it could do a quick table lookup when someone says "accept"… more than one thing that can be "accept"ed? ask for clarification
would feel more conversational rather than forcing "accept 123" for any invitation
<@U04SM6T2H>: good article :simple_smile:
<@U0HRRS59R> that's exactly what we are doing (tracking multiple conversations). You could easily build that clarification step on top, perhaps something I should blog about :)
<@U0HRRS59R> <http://blog.converse.ai/introduction/conversation-state-conversation-maps/> covers some of it
awesome!
<@U0CNYC404>: Im curious how you are managing the “always on” problem or dealing with multiple parties chatting in channel.
Various solutions to that, about to run out of mobile battery, will reply soon :)
ran out 30 seconds later :stuck_out_tongue:
we track each user/channel combo separately at the moment (as different requests), going to add an option for it to just be each channel for those that want to interact in one conversation if it's requested.  If we see a message but can't react to it for some reason, the system can either ignore it or respond to say it doesn't understand
Okay, but if you have User A,B and Bot C. and user A and B are chatting. You don't want C to chime in after each request with “I don't understand"
no, indeed, which is why by default, it just does nothing
depends entirely on how someone wants to set it up (e.g if it's @botname) then you would want it to reply with ‘I don't understand', if it's monitoring everything, you wouldn't
This is an interesting challenge and primary only applicable to bots in channels unlike SMS and the role they must play. Moderator vs Percipient
and the greater question, even if there is a matching trigger, should it reply?
indeed, I suspect it may depend on a channel and bot individual basis though
perhaps you could use a command to trigger one behavior or the other?
Hi all, quick question for the XOXCO devs, any plans to push the LunchBot into Howdy? Or any other lunch suggestion bots being created?
Ive played with having a whitelist that you get added to once you at mention the bot, and you get unlisted after various events (delay between replies) or a trigger miss (off topic)
Hi All, Just wondering if anyone has had link formatting working
every time i try it, it puts the formatted text in the chat, rather than changing it to a link, with the correct link text
`parse: full` is your friend
yeah I had that set
