U5FU80S06 : In <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Events#onMouseEnter>, what's the difference between `onMouseEnter` &amp; `onMouseOver`? Same question for  `onMouseLeave` &amp; `onMouseOut`.
U0J8D9M2P : Enter happens one time when you enter, over happens many times when you move mouse
U5FU80S06 : Thanks
U0J8D9M2P : Leave will happen only once you live the element, and out will be triggered any time you leave child elements as well

U3HQVHERX : I have a utc date time that looks like this: `"2017-07-05T20:14:02.530471"` and I want to display it in us/pacific time zone. I started trying to do this with `elm-community/elm-time` but it seems the library does not keep track of the time, just dates
U3HQVHERX : `ZonedDateTime { timeZone = TimeZone { name = "Etc/UTC", spans = [{ from = -Infinity, until = Infinity, abbreviation = "UTC", offset = 0 }] }, dateTime = DateTime { date = Date { year = 2017, month = 7, day = 6 }, offset = 11642530 } }`
U3HQVHERX : That's what I'm currently getting
U3HQVHERX : er - `Just` that.
U3HQVHERX : after doing
U3HQVHERX : ```Date.fromString m.created_at
|&gt; Result.toMaybe
|&gt; Maybe.map Date.toTime
|&gt; Maybe.map (Time.ZonedDateTime.fromTimestamp &lt;| utc ())
```

U3HQVHERX : Oh maybe it does `text &lt;| Time.ZonedDateTime.toISO8601 d`
U0LPMPL2U : It looks like you string is ISO8601 formatted?
U0LPMPL2U : LOL :smile:
U3HQVHERX : `2017-07-06T03:14:02.530+00:00`
U3HQVHERX : <@U0LPMPL2U> actually it could not parse it :disappointed:
U3HQVHERX : oh waut
U3HQVHERX : wait*
U3HQVHERX : `Date.fromString` i was passing the result of that function to the fromISO8601 function
U3HQVHERX : maybe that's why, XD
U0LPMPL2U : Also, going through `Date.fromString` may be what's truncating the time parts
U3HQVHERX : ```, date =
                        m.created_at
                            |&gt; Time.ZonedDateTime.fromISO8601 (us_pacific ())
                            |&gt; Result.toMaybe
```

U3HQVHERX : Now I am getting `Nothing`
U3HQVHERX : `fromISO8601 : TimeZone -&gt; String -&gt; Result String ZonedDateTime`
U3HQVHERX : `us_pacific : () -&gt; TimeZone`
U3HQVHERX : and `m.created_at` is `"2017-07-05T20:14:02.530471"`
U0LPMPL2U : Can you drop the `Result.toMaybe` so we can see the error?
U3HQVHERX : good idea
U3HQVHERX : "Errors encountered at position 26: expected \"Z\" or expected an integer"
U0LPMPL2U : Does it not like the decimal seconds?
U3HQVHERX : it wants a char `'Z'` at the end i think
