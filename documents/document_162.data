Can you upload custom emoji via the API?
Does anyone know?
I think it's in the doc that you can't

Hey all.. we've written up some learnings about our bot &amp; analytics. Check it out here: <https://medium.com/@artemerritt/got-bot-analytics-1909c677a6fb>
<@U0DSTH2HL>: nice
I'm just looking at my first conversation on <http://dashbot.io|dashbot.io> and I have to say I really like what I see so far
<@U0DSTH2HL>: very cool. You might find <http://slackcharts.com|slackcharts.com> interesting to push your visualizations back into a chatbot #botception ;)
<@U0DSTH2HL> looks like one of the first real shot at bot analytics

Hi all, I am going to develop a slack bot using nodejs and <http://api.ai|api.ai>. Which library should i use? botkit or node-slack-sdk <https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-sdk>
<@U1E7WGWRM>: Botkit!!
There is an <http://API.ai|API.ai> middleware that makes it very easy 
<https://github.com/xVir/api-ai-slack-bot>
Is it the one you are referring to <@U04SM6T2H> ??
No
Botkit-middleware-apiai
Thanks <@U04SM6T2H>
(according to the docs it should work for custom integrations, and it's a custom bot api token that I'm using
Hello guys! I have a question for experts familier with botkit. How to create a group or do any action requiring real user rights? When I call `bot.api.groups.create` it says me that I'm bot, ant that's right. But I can't find out how to do smth like `user_from_convo.api.groups.create`
hello guys
I wanna create a slack bot SaaS service, how are you scaling BotKit?
micro services with separation of responsibilities and queueing services such as rabbitmq / redis
okay but to scale the botkit layer, is it simple as spawning many controllers as needed?
<@U1EG97KUY>: kind of, you need to shard RTM connections, which botkit won't do as it stands right now
so it's up to you to architect that
Ideally you want a single node process per slack team you're connecting to, so if an instance of botkit crashes it only affects one team. Look into something like pm2 (<https://github.com/Unitech/pm2>) to keep those instances up and errors logged
<@U0CS6NSF5> but does botkit exposes anything? Right now it seems kind of black box
I know they haven't built scaling within botkit yet, I don't use it myself :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U1C5VL0EQ>: are you running one node process per team?
yes, but only because I'm only connecting to one team :slightly_smiling_face:
and how much memory does that team take?
good question, I actually have no idea
doing it that way will probably be more expensive, since you will need more memory per team
and you still need to set it up to shard teams across machines anyway
unless pm2 does run in a cluster and orchestates it
Here's my app created for the company I work with. I just wondering if i can get feedbacks :simple_smile: I had already submitted it to Slack App directory and its passed the reviewed . I just waiting for the official listing.   <https://timetracker.mesasix.com>
Do i have a way to know the team's id in a botkit conversation?
<https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/readme-slack.md#how-to-identify-what-team-your-message-came-from>
<@U19J7PF7T>: ^
<@U04SM6T2H>:  thanks a lot
I almost got it working,. the only thing i need is to get the channel id where the bot has been added
is there any method?
<@U19J7PF7T>: they can be in multiple channels, right? You'd have to inspect the message to see where _it_ came from.
right
Hi Guys, as far i can see, there is no option to display postback buttons while sending message from slack bot. What is the best alternative guys?
i think it will be added just in a <#C04SM6TAK> channel
<@U1E7WGWRM>: You can do an attachment with a title_link? <https://api.slack.com/docs/attachments>
Or maybe just send back a URL so the user's browser opens, and have a button there.
<@U1BPBKXK5>:  no I dont want to display any url. i want to give three options to user which on click, can send me payload. the same way as fb messenger bot works
Ah, I see. I don't think Slack does that. Maybe you could do something similar with reaction emoji?
Most things like this that I've seen have people replying to the bot with "1", "2", "3", etc, but I'm not a huge fan tbh
yes exactly
thats not a structured messaging then from slack bot
i am new to slack world. have been working on messenger bots before
<@U19J7PF7T>: bots do not get added to any channels by default
they have to be invited
like vampires
<@U1EG97KUY> <@U0CS6NSF5> FWIW we handle RTM connection scheduling and autoscaling across multiple botkit processes on Beep Boop :slightly_smiling_face:
we've got it sorted in our case already :slightly_smiling_face:

Hello all, anyone familiar with Botkit ?
Best try the <#C0AV5N8NA> channel mate
thanks, will try
Hello there, does someone know what `invalid_auth` means?
<@U0GT29N3A>: it means the token is incorrect
the API has sometimes had bugs where `invalid_auth` was returned instead of the actual error like `token_revoked`
Hum. I have the other situation. I sometimes get `invalid_auth` for a perfectly valid token.
probably a bug
In fact since yesterday evening, issuing a request with "fresh" bot token (just when coming back from the Oauth workflow) *always* returns an `invalid_auth` for us...
This is quite annoying
<@U07VCKRUK>: :point_up:  is that a known issue already?
No — I'm not aware of any widespread issue.  Can you please open a help case by emailing us at <mailto:feedback@slack.com|feedback@slack.com> ?
<@U07VCKRUK>: already did that, just got a response, I'm replying to acknowledge the problem.
Zendesk issue is 1031297 [NZK379-YD6N]
I'm having the same issue as <@U0GT29N3A> , on first install of the bot, it appears the token is invalid (getting invalid_auth message and bot is offline) ... but if i uninstall and re-install the bot, everything's good... it's just that first auth... happening since about yesterday at 12pm Eastern Time
we saw that yesterday too, had to restart the websocket connection to get the bot working after our first attempts gave us `invalid_auth`
Can you share any code on how to do that?  I haven't dug too deep into the inners of BotKit, aside from some tweaks to suit my needs
we're not using botkit actually, using <https://github.com/zerobotlabs/relax> right now
I'll take a look, thanks!!!
I'm getting the “invalid_auth” bug too.. I just tried installing our bot, <@U1ESKE8HW> here, and had to uninstall &amp; reinstall to get a valid auth. I'm seeing this error occur for any installs in the past 24 hours.
That's at least 4 of us now! Glad to see we're not alone :slightly_smiling_face:
uhoh!
Our engineering and ops teams have been looking into this — it sounds like we're close to figuring it out.  Sorry for the bother!
You have no idea how much trouble this has done for us. We were wrongly (our bad) considering this invalid_auth as a revoked token, so basically it was almost impossible to install our app, since the teams were revoked as soon as they connected.
I understand, I'm sorry.  We're working to fix the problem as soon as possible.
YAY!!! :smile:
<@U0GT29N3A>: is it happening with all installs, or only sporadically?
<@U0CS6NSF5>: all installs, but the delay may vary between 1-5 seconds
I just checked and it seems we've hit the issue too
So does this mean that anyone who has joined using the slackbutton _today_ is basically dead in the water?
Only if you don't retry the connection some time later after first receiving the `invalid_auth` error.
not everybody
hi everyone
And only for bots (user tokens were not affected for us)
hrmm
ok
It happened for all installs for us too and when I tried adding other bots (to make sure it wasn't us), the same thing happened. Some bots would show up, but not be online and a few (e.g. polly) would send the first message, then bomb
oof
ok
i'm sure folks at Slack are ON IT
<@U07VCKRUK>: can something go up here? <https://status.slack.com/>
the frustrating part is that the bot user gets added, but is then not online, so it feels like your bot is just zombied.
Sory for the noob question but, is there a way to implement an onboarding message when the bot is added to the group¿?
<https://blog.mixpanel.com/2016/06/07/bots-for-slack/>
<@U19J7PF7T>: <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage>
<@U19J7PF7T>: You mean when the bot is invited to a private group?
got it! thanks!
oooh like when i add the bot to a <#C04SM6TAK> group
you will also need to use `im.open` if its a new conversation.
<@U19J7PF7T>: also maybe listen for the bot_channel_join event
ok, great, thank you!
Just to let y'all know that we're aware of the bot token issue, and we're working on it now!
<@U0D7LHNTX> if the fix isn't quick +1 on getting the thing reported on the status page asap.
How's it looking now, y'all?
We've put out a potential fix…any reports since about 12:30PM PDT?
Working for <http://obie.ai|obie.ai>!
what is human?
What are the ramifications for tokens that were granted during the period where there were issues?  Do we need to take retroactive steps to refresh / prompt people to re-authorize OAuth2 scopes during a certain window? <@U0D7LHNTX> thanks for the updates!
Tokens are valid. If you have them somewhere, you can use them to connect the teams now.
Thanks <@U0D7LHNTX> and <@U07VCKRUK> and everyone!
