Still JSON decoding feels a little bit like black magic to me.
<@U2D7NUGS1> which part feels like magic?
It's hard to pin it down. I guess that's the thing about magic :magic_wand:
`Decode.map2 Attribute` is often something that people mention
`(<http://Decode.at|Decode.at> [ "name" ] Decode.string)` is pretty straight forward
`Decode.map stringToValueType Decode.string` is just a `map` and it works like most other `map` functions. eg. `Maybe.map`, `List.map` etc.
I find writing json decoders hard because the error messages look really crazy when I mess up - and as a beginner I mess them up constantly. And I'm probably pampered already by the other Elm compiler error messages...
<@U153UK3FA> you are right and I'm not really complaining. Probably it's just my brain rewiring from imperative to FP.
Probably the difficult part is composing decoders. In JS you would just travers value. In Elm you have to think in more abstract terms.
Yeah, you have to compose them to match the intended structure. It's a somewhat different way of thinking, indeed.
It's very good. Just takes a change of a mindset.
<@U604S603Y> are you using elm-decoder-pipeline ? That trades nicer API against good error messages
yes, I am using elm-decoder-pipeline
I've missed something, but have no idea what it is.
to be fair, <@U3LUC6SNS>, I didn't see an api.js when I had a look at your code last week.. I did see a `server.js` though, but that seems a mock at most
can you check if there _is_ an api.js on your (former) dev machine? Plugging in an external keyboard might help..
<@U3SJEDR96>, I'll investigate -- thanks!
<@U3SJEDR96>, just looked at the old app folder.  No `api.js` file there.  Interestingly enough, when I run `yarn start` there, I get a similar error message.: `Cannot find model ...koko_client/api.js` etc.  But it is much shorter.  It ends with `Killing all processs with signal null ... Exited with code 1`  But then it goes on to say `Project is running at http://...3000`
Hard to do much on the old machine since I can't type a space with the  incompatible keyboard.
server.js is an express web server.  I looked in webpack.config.js and found no `api.js`
