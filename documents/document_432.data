What am I doing wrong?
`withQueryParams` doesn't want JSON ¯\_(?)_/¯
Just get rid of "Econde.string"? Encode.object doesn't expect you to convert the second element of the tuple.
It does, acutally
Oh, it's happening further up
`withQueryParams` I'm assuming you're using `elm-http-builder`. Now, queryparams there talk about the url, not the body
I'm not sure what a json object in an url would actually look like?
so yea, <@U31FGNWCT> you'll need to figure out if you want a JSON body using `withJsonBody` or query params using `withQueryParams` which needs strings as key-value pairs
