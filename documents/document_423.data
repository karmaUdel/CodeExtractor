Basically, how do I get List Participant into Json.Encode
so you want to write a Json encoder?
If need to be, yes
This `List Participant` thing looks to me a lot like a javascript object :smile:
already
you have a Participant encoder? `Participant -&gt; Json.Encoder.Value`
<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Encode#encode>
If you do then to create a function of `List Participant -&gt; Json.Encode.Value` simply requires calling `Json.Encoder.list`
I think this is the piece I am missing, if I have a type Participant, and a List Participant, I don't understand how to write the Json encoder to handle this custom type
do you mind pasting in the type you created for `Participant`?
what does `Participant` look like
