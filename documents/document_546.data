U236M9FH9 : `Array.indexedMap`, but switch `\val i -&gt;` to `\i val -&gt;`
U2SR9DL7Q : Newbie Question of the day : If I get a package from elm-package, and it's not compatible with my version of elm, or I decide I no longer need it, do I just just remove it from the package json?
U236M9FH9 : yup
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U236M9FH9>  cool. Also, if I'm  having trouble with a package, I've seen some answer suggesting deleting the elm stuff folder. How would I rebuild said folder after?
U236M9FH9 : It gets generates when you run elm-make
U5XC2FJ1Y : actually i'm not sure if i can even write any function `List number -&gt; Float` except by implementing a constant function `const : a -&gt; Float` and using letbindings to cheat the type inferrer
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U236M9FH9> double cool. Thanks thanks
U6D3ERLA1 : There's no ternary operator in elm?
U0LPMPL2U : `if condition then value else otherValue`
U5XC2FJ1Y : `&gt;` doesn't take a polymorphic `number`
U0LPMPL2U : same as the multiline form but without whitespace```
if condition then
  value
else
  otherValue
```

U6D3ERLA1 : I'm using the elm vim formatter which is pretty ruthless in its enforcement of white space... a        L     O     T      of whitespace
U6D3ERLA1 : O  n  c  e     y  o  u     s  t  a  r  t     r   e  a  d  i  n  g     i  t     t  h  o     y  o  u     s  t  a  r  t     t  o     w  o  n  d  e  r     w  h  y     e  v  e  r  y  t  h  i  n  g     e  l  s  e     i  s     s  o     c  r  o  w  d  e  d
U6D3ERLA1 : :white_large_square:
U0LPMPL2U : haha yes. I've found it also pushes me to write many small functions instead of nesting things deeply
U6D3ERLA1 : true, it doesn't really work with long functions
U6D3ERLA1 : definitely makes sense with the terse / dense idiom
U6D3ERLA1 : I feel like I"m getting closer and closer to a form of pure notation as my career goes on
U6D3ERLA1 : ```    Array.indexedMap
        (\y row -&gt;
            Array.indexedMap
                (\x val -&gt;
                    if hasCoord (getCoords { x = x, y = y } l d k grid) then
                        key
                    else
                        val
                )
                row
        )
        grid
```

U6D3ERLA1 : this is a little ridic tho
U2SR9DL7Q : Has anyone experience a situation where the elm package installer is successfully downloading elm packages, but the compiler/linter can't find the imported packages in elm-stuff? (But you can see them there)
U0LPMPL2U : I feel like there's some way to use a `map2` function to make that nicer
U14Q8S4EM : Yeah but, I would kinda doubt my own sanity first. Have you tried deleting `elm-stuff`, and re-installing?
U14Q8S4EM : What package are you trying to use <@U2SR9DL7Q> , and what is the error?
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U14Q8S4EM> <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/wernerdegroot/listzipper/1.0.2/List-Zipper> And the error just says that it can't import import it. But the dependency is defined in elm-package,json
U2SR9DL7Q : The same thing happened when I tried another package recently. And when I tried just copy pasting the relevant elm files in my main project folder, it was recognizing most of the exposed functions, but not a key exposed type. It's all very strange. Contemplating rebuilding elm-stuff.
U14Q8S4EM : Do you have your code online? I could try building it.
