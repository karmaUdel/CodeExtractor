U3QVAJ5QV : <@U1BP42MRS> zappa .... at least if you don't want to mess with the zappa-conda fork.
U0NRYQNAZ : i don't see why you couldn't use a virtualenv for virtualenv things and conda for conda things. the issue is when you try to mix them together but as long as you're pointed at the right python interpreter things should work.
U0NRYQNAZ : what have you tried so far?
U3QVAJ5QV : Ok. So ... I'm not sure how to ‘point' it at the right thing ... not even sure where to start.
U3QVAJ5QV : Just switch the path/env settings?
U0NRYQNAZ : with virtualenv you activate the environment and it does a lot of handy little things for you like setting the python python.
U0NRYQNAZ : so you activate the virtualenv when you want to use zappa.
U0NRYQNAZ : `source /venv-name/bin/activate` should do it
U0NRYQNAZ : are you using python 2 or python 3?
U5SQYT750 : Conda does the same really, so ```conda create envname``` gives you a conda environment
U5SQYT750 : and then ```source activate envname``` sets it up
U5SQYT750 : you can use ```which python``` to check which one you are using
U0NRYQNAZ : but i think the issue is with the library <@U5SQYT750>, :re <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1497625527626658>
U3QVAJ5QV : 3 ... and (maybe this is just a dumb question) but I was worried that installing using conda to install virtual env is not what I wanted.
U5SQYT750 : but as <@U0NRYQNAZ> said, probably best to not try and mix them up
U5SQYT750 : Oh, hadn't seen zappa before
U0NRYQNAZ : when you do `which python` what comes up?
U3QVAJ5QV : Normally the conda one.
U0NRYQNAZ : that's where we would run into our first issue. we wouldn't want to be using the conda one. we would want something like the system python, i believe.
U3QVAJ5QV : Right... thus my question :slightly_smiling_face:
U3QVAJ5QV : Seems like I need to be able to deactivate conda and ‘activate' python3 (sytem would be python2) and then use virtual env.  Thanks for getting me started on the right track.
