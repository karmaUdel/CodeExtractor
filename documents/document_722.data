```
It's in line 24 or 25 
Under the books (selection) function
Oh I understand now
lines 31 and 32 are resetting the lists. The list of books and costs gets dropped down to original
lists when that function is called.
that call happens in lines 24/25
Right and I'm trying to figure out how to fix that problem
Look into how to pass lists to functions, as you are doing with `selection`
Name? 
I dont have that anywhere
Right now lines 1 - 3 don't really do anything. Your program runs b/c you call menu() at the end. Instead, call main(), which in turn calls menu()
Also, try this <@U6EN2E1LG>
name is a built-in that is defined by the python interpreter (I'm jumping in late, but I think that's what you had asked)
:point_up:
What does name do? 
this
It's an ugly thing that we have to accept lol
And that's it? That's a little vague
I use main to call functions menu and register
