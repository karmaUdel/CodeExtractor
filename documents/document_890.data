U1BP42MRS : In case you need the intro doc :point_up::skin-tone-4: 
U5KUA7XPG : Okey, so in the future I will post my question in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> at first. After some time without response I will paste it here. Is it a good habit?
U29163YQH : :thumbsup:
U5KUA7XPG : Thanks for quick intro.
U1BP42MRS : minor correction, "share" it here :slightly_smiling_face: <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/203274767-Share-messages-in-Slack>
U1PCHFXMH : Hmmm... I have a list of dictionaries that I need to merge but sum one of the keys. Need some direction. My Monday brain is not working efficiently.Something like this
```
# start with
[
    {'first': 'Frank', 'val': 12, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 2},
    {'first': 'Jane', 'val': 12, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 3},
    {'first': 'Frank', 'val': 12, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 2}
]

# end with
[
    {'first': 'Frank', 'val': 24, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 2},
    {'first': 'Jane', 'val': 12, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 3}
]
```

U1BP42MRS : <@U1PCHFXMH> - is the merge based on the `id` field (or a grouping of the values)? Also does order matter?
U1PCHFXMH : order does not matter, i just need to sum the "val", every other piece of data is the same, the id will always be the same
U1PCHFXMH : so yes, on the `id` field
U1PCHFXMH : With my real data, I am merging on a unique string code
U1BP42MRS : I would probably use a dict if the dataset is small enough:
```
cache = {}
for item in my_list:
    if item['id'] not in cache.keys():
        cache[item['id']] = item
    else:
        cache[item['id']]['val'] += item['val']
```

U1PCHFXMH : That complicates things later on when I split the list in two by a column value of True/False, but I suppose I can work around that.Thanks for taking a look <@U1BP42MRS> :taco:

U1BP42MRS : Yeah it's a little awkward, but at the end I meant to print `cache.values()` 
U1PCHFXMH : <@U1BP42MRS> Right of course... it's been a long day for me too.That works great, when the data gets too large I'll adjust as necessary.

U1BP42MRS : Good call on not pre-optimizing too much! I am sure there is some really terse and cool trick, but I like simple :smile:
U69D9FG5N : Get the loader memory for each machine ?Is there any good way?
U6B8B09JT : question for anyone who uses pyenv — should the `.python-version` file be commited to vcs, or is it considered good practise to ignore this file?
U13L8J76J : <@U6B8B09JT> ignore, of course
U13L8J76J : That's an environmental detail
U3T76H0JW : How can I send the value of a variable in endpoints api to _post_put_hook function in python ?
U3T76H0JW : can anyone help ?
U29163YQH : I'm sure someone can help but you'll need to post more details :slightly_smiling_face:
U3T76H0JW : I am using google cloud endpoints along with ndb datastore .
U3T76H0JW : I am setting values in my request class parameters
U3T76H0JW : can then I put these data in ndb
U3T76H0JW : my api know the value of the variable
U3T76H0JW : but right after I put
U3T76H0JW : _post_put_hook function is called
U3T76H0JW : but it does not know the value of that variable
U29163YQH : Sorry I have never used google could endpoints so I can't really help you :confused:
U3Z88DBAQ : <@U3T76H0JW> can you post a snippet of your code ?
U0NRYQNAZ : so i started using fantastical and i really like it but want to integrate other services. they didn't make this very easy =(. to parse text outside of fantastical it says to type this: `<x-fantastical2://parse?s=Sentence> goes here` i tried this in a browser to no avail. does anyone know where i can type this sort of thing into osx?
U0NRYQNAZ : i've tried spotlight but that didn't work either.
U4BMZ90T0 : Anyone have a simple to use GUI?
U1BP42MRS : HTML?
U0LSCQQNR : desktop?
U0LSCQQNR : tkinter, I'd say
U4BMZ90T0 : Yeah desktop, and I saw tkinter, might have to go with that
U4BMZ90T0 : has anyone worked with crucible/fish eye before?
U0LSCQQNR : I've used crucible before
U0LSCQQNR : was ok
U0LSCQQNR : why?
U4BMZ90T0 : Basically grabbing analytics from it for peer reviews and then essentially updating a CSV with new data of progress of peer reviews
U4BMZ90T0 : So I gotta use their API, hoping I can get the data I need
U0NRYQNAZ : not sure this will work but if you used a jupyter notebook they would have something essentially like a gui. they could run your code and get ouput and it be relatively easy.
U1BP42MRS : Uh oh, management wants insights... huh?
U4BMZ90T0 : Haha, well they already get insights. It just gets tedious for the guys to hand type in all the updated info for each week for the last 12 weeks
U4BMZ90T0 : and it has to be redone each time cause each week the analytics change of course for the weeks before also so they can spend an hour updating the thing
U4BMZ90T0 : When python can do it in a few seconds :slightly_smiling_face:
U0NRYQNAZ : checkout a temp jupyter notebook here: <https://tmpnb.org/>
U4BMZ90T0 : What is it exactly? <@U0NRYQNAZ> temporary server for running python?
U2AC2ECET : jupyter is cool
U0NRYQNAZ : &gt; The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.
U4BMZ90T0 : Hmmm okay that might be really convenient
U2AC2ECET : plus it can be put on github and look cool
U4BMZ90T0 : Sort of like a prelim thing I can show them when I'm done and they can decide if they want a GUI or not
U0NRYQNAZ : you might have to setup your own jupyterhub server but it is relatively easy to do. the jupyterhub server can be setup to require username and password.
U0NRYQNAZ : then no one needs to install anything.
U0NRYQNAZ : they simply go to your page: <http://jupyter.kbman.com|jupyter.kbman.com> and login
U0NRYQNAZ : i have an ansible playbook if needed :wink:
U0NRYQNAZ : more info here: <https://jupyter.org/>
U4BMZ90T0 : Once I get this setup I'll definitely get that setup
U2AC2ECET : if you are just looking to use basic jupyter, and you use pycharm you can start a new project, pip install jupyter then instead of making a .py file you can make a .ipynb file
U0NRYQNAZ : since it is python the sky is the limit. if you want you can setup a way for the csv to be emailed to them or whatever.
U0NRYQNAZ : the notebooks can also utilize `input` if you need the user to type in information.
U0NRYQNAZ : so if you wanted to run a cli script inside the notebook and prompt them for their name, etc, you can do that.
U4BMZ90T0 : That might actually be super convenient
U4BMZ90T0 : Oh man this should be fun. The documentation for this API is leading me to 404 errors.
U1BP42MRS : TIL ipython does input
U1BP42MRS : <@U0NRYQNAZ> can you show live terminal output in there?
U0NRYQNAZ : what do you mean live?
U1BP42MRS : Say I run a long-running subprocess
U0NRYQNAZ : hmmm... idk. i would have to try it. you can run pip commands and they scroll out. that's what is happening at the top.
U1BP42MRS : Or can you only spawn one and print the data
U1BP42MRS : Oh, I guess I didn't think about how they have the syntax to run straight shell commands
U1BP42MRS : <@U0NRYQNAZ> :taco:
U1BP42MRS : I totally spaced the `!shell command`
U0NRYQNAZ : yea it's cool
U0NRYQNAZ : i use jupyter notebook for one off things like this all the time.
U0NRYQNAZ : very convenient
U1BP42MRS : Yeah, I was thinking about adding a subdomain to my site so I can just have one centralized
U0NRYQNAZ : i have an ansible playbook if you want to deploy jupyterhub.
U0NRYQNAZ : you will have to pull all the the R things out of it.
U0NRYQNAZ : one of my first projects where i work was setting up a jupyterhub with an R kernel and other packages.
U1BP42MRS : Oh yeah, I love references
U0NRYQNAZ : i'll try to test it later on to make sure it works. haha
U1BP42MRS : okie
U0NRYQNAZ : i have a vm i can run the playbook.
U29163YQH : Would love to have it too. <@U1BP42MRS> one of pyslackers rôle? 
U1BP42MRS : We can do that for sure, make it a community effort
U1BP42MRS : I'll start on breaking those up tonight if I have time
U29163YQH : :thumbsup: 
U5VGKQ2SY : Do you still need help w/ this?
U1BP42MRS : <@U0NRYQNAZ> another reason why rails is stupid:
* it's valid to do something like `<redis://localhost>`
* but they decide to enforce that the host needs to be a domain name... so in my compose file I had to hack it with `<redis://redis.cache>`

U6AFDVDA9 : hello, could someone help me with a flask issue i'm having?
U1BP42MRS : Simply post your question in <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>
U1NSCAY6R : <@U6AFDVDA9> sure, post your question here (or <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>) and someone will answer when they can :slightly_smiling_face:
U1BP42MRS : Please read the intro doc on suggestions, basically: post your question (rather than ask for permission).
U6AFDVDA9 : :thumbsup: will do
U6AFDVDA9 : thx
U1BP42MRS : You got it!
U6AFDVDA9 : so i'm working on a small web app that will allow users to search instagram for two hashtags at the same time.  
the route of the app the user is given this form 

```
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Enter two comma separated tags (no hashtag symbol!!!)&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;form method="POST" action="{{ url_for('results', token=token) }}"&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" name="text"&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" name="my-form" value="Send"&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

Which is processed by this route

```
@app.route('/results/', methods=['GET', 'POST'], defaults={'token': None})
@app.route('/results/&lt;token&gt;', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def results(token):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        tags = request.form['text'].replace(' ', '').split(',')
        data = fetch_data(tags=tags, next_page_token=token)
        processed_data, token = process_data(data=data, tags=tags)

    if request.method == 'GET':
        <http://logging.info|logging.info>('REQUEST ARGS: {}'.format(request.args))

    return render_template('results.html', data=processed_data[:1], token=token)
```

and the results are displayed via this template

```
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body style="background-color:powderblue;"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;{{ data }}&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;form action="{{ url_for('results', token=token) }}"&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="More results plz" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

my issue is that i'm trying to pass the next page token to the results page through the URL, so that when the user push the button for more results, ti gets sent back to the `/results` route.  right now when i load the "more results" i get a `500` error and it doesn't look like the token is being passed in the url properly because it is before the question mark

```
INFO:werkzeug:10.51.50.1 - - [18/Jul/2017 17:24:36] "GET /results/J0HWW5ERQAAAF0HWW5CPQAAAFoAKAA%253D%253D? HTTP/1.1" 500 -
```

U6AFDVDA9 : this line in particular `<http://logging.info|logging.info>('REQUEST ARGS: {}'.format(request.args))` returns `INFO:root:REQUEST ARGS: ImmutableMultiDict([])`
U5LNXQHN3 : What does the HTML of the page look like? That `{{ url_for('results', token=token) }}` bit should be expanded out, so you can verify what it's passing in
U5LNXQHN3 : Oh, wait, the token does come through - I had to scroll down to see your Log line. But it's not in 'args', perhaps, and that's okay
U6AFDVDA9 : hm
U5LNXQHN3 : You should try logging what `token` is equal to
U6AFDVDA9 : kk
U5LNXQHN3 : Also, if you get a 500 error, normally that would give you a traceback, no? So you could see exactly where it breaks
U6AFDVDA9 : ah, so it is coming though as the variable token, but it's not something i can parse from the url because it's not an actual arg
U6AFDVDA9 : is there a better way to pass data from page to page? maybe with query params?
