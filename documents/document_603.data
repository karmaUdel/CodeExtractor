U66RFDZ8F : <@U3SJEDR96> `withCredentials` should only have an effect on `cors` requests
U3SJEDR96 : Yeah, and cookies are automatically sent on same-origin requests
U3SJEDR96 : Since cookies weren't sent, that implies it was a cross-origin request
U3SJEDR96 : Unless I'm confusing the issue here, which is super-possible because I was mostly reacting to the "setting cookie headers yourself" comment
U66RFDZ8F : ok
U66RFDZ8F : I haven't tried setting cookie headers, but just wanted to point out the possibility was there
U3SJEDR96 : That's the thing, you actually can't. Cookie headers are under exclusive control of the UA, can't be directly set through XHR. Same with `Content-Length` and a few others :slightly_smiling_face:
U5ABF3BH7 : Hi again Gilbert! When I look a the following method in
U5ABF3BH7 : ```    validateInput : Int -&gt; Int -&gt; String -&gt; Maybe String
validateInput low high =
    Validate.eager
        [Validate.ifBlank ("Please type a number from " ++ toString low ++ " to " ++ toString high ++ ".")
        , validateResult (\_ -&gt; "Entered value is not an integer.") (validateInRange low high) &lt;&lt; String.toInt
        ]```

U5ABF3BH7 : Is the result a Maybe String, or a function (String -&gt; Maybe String)?
U6E5PS83X : I started my app with this in my `index.html`:
```
var main = document.getElementById('my-elm-app');
Elm.Main.embed(main);
```

now i've got

```
var app = Elm.Main.fullscreen(localStorage.session || null);
app.ports.storeSession.subscribe(function(session) {
    localStorage.session = session;
});
window.addEventListener("storage", function(event) {
    if (event.storageArea === localStorage &amp;&amp; event.key === "session") {
        app.ports.onSessionChange.send(event.newValue);
    }
}, false);
```

Is there a way I can use session storage while still using `embed` instead of `fullscreen`?

U6E5PS83X : actually, does `embed` still return an object i can assign to `var app`?
U6E5PS83X : though i'm not sure how to pass `localStorage.session || null` to `embed`
U6E5PS83X : Aha, I've figured it out:
```
var main = document.getElementById('friday-calls');
var app = Elm.Main.embed(main, localStorage.session || null); // &lt;-- the magic

app.ports.storeSession.subscribe(function(session) {
    localStorage.session = session;
});

window.addEventListener("storage", function(event) {
    if (event.storageArea === localStorage &amp;&amp; event.key === "session") {
        app.ports.onSessionChange.send(event.newValue);
    }
}, false);
```

U5ABF3BH7 : Hi again! I have an input field, I want to show an error if the character entered is different from a digit or '-'. How can I accomplish that in Elm?
U23SA861Y : presumably you have a field in your model that has the string you want to validate
U23SA861Y : then you would need to construct a function `valid: String-&gt;Bool`
U23SA861Y : then in your view check the string and display or not display your warning
U5ABF3BH7 : Right <@U23SA861Y>, I want to show a warning when the user enters an invalid character. It is for a social number. My issue is how to build that function.
U4JT89FGB : untested: `Regex.contains (Regex.regex "(\\d|-)*") inputString`
U23SA861Y : regex would be the correct tool, although becareful as they can cause runtime errors
U4JT89FGB : i think you just need to make sure your user isn't inputting the string to get converted to a regex, correct <@U23SA861Y>?
U23SA861Y : yeah, I believe the RTE occurs when it parses the regex itself so if its a compile time constant you should be safe


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
	If Yes:
	1.Bad	2.Very bad
	If No:
	1.Good	2.Very good


How confident are you?
	1.Low
	2.Average
	3.High

Optional!
can you highlight place/word/sentence which lead to your decision
