Is your Elm code in src/Main.elm?
I haven’t touched MIDI yet, but would be very interested if you find any existing work
yes, it starts there, and the rest of the elm code is all under _src_.
Not to worry, it's not a biggie. I can always do a Debug.log...
what's the error message?
I will post this in the general channel as well.
