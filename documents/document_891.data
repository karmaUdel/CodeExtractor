U6AFDVDA9 : thanks for the help
U5LNXQHN3 : :+1:
U42LCHFD2 : Whats the context?
U2BS4M1RV : I'm a bit late to this, but depending on what you need to do, tablib can also be useful.
U6A6D1TT4 : Hello, I been looking for a way to create script that gathers info from yahoo finance or morning star, financial numbers I can calculate later on with python. I have found an interesting youtube tutorial which goes trough the same topic <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2zyPby4034&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDejNczz7dbpyu3JnwUBvNch> but the problem is that its in python 2 and some of the steps does not work anymore. I know thought that I can convert the python 2 to 3 and find some hacky ways how to do it still but I wonder if it's worth the effort. Maybe there are some better ways I can do with python 3. I readed a bit about modules like pandas and beautiful soup but not sure if they are fit for this purpose. Anyone could point me to a direction what would be the best method for gathering financial fundamental data? I am quite new to python
U0NRYQNAZ : if the course is really good and the downside is the fact that it uses python 2 then i would just convert as i go. everything i've done so far with scipy, numpy, and pandas has worked in python 3.6. google the errors and tracebacks you get and i bet there are a lot of solutions.
U0NRYQNAZ : the other option is using penv.
U0NRYQNAZ : pyenv makes it pretty easy to run multiple python versions.
U42LCHFD2 : Someone on that youtube video also posted a package for it <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yahoo-finance/1.3.2>  - i havent tried it - just pointing it out
U0NRYQNAZ : you could run the code in python 2 to just get it working and then conver to python 3
U5S8CNULD : Hi guys, I need your help.
```
companies = db.session.query(
            Company.owner_id,
            func.sum(Company.salary).label('salary'),
            func.sum(Company.employees).label('employees'),
            func.sum(Company.pad).label('pad')). \
            join(Owner).filter(Owner.company == company_type).filter(Owner.user_id == user.id).\
            group_by(Comapny.owner_ids)
```
Okay, I able to sum all those fileds. but I need to output  some `string` fields, but I don't have any ideas, how I can implement this.

U60KNBMPX : is there anything for which a module does not exist?
U6A6D1TT4 : thanks, I think I will go trough the tutorial then and each step do some investigating how to make it work in the python 3 lets see how it ends up :stuck_out_tongue: at least I think I will learn more about python that way :smile:
U60KNBMPX : <@U6A6D1TT4> that is a cool project idea
U60KNBMPX : Yahoo finance is the best *free* source of financial data out there. Google isn't as good given the constraints they place on how much data you can pull from their servers
U0NRYQNAZ : finally got that stupid private github dependency to install in travis from a public repo. holy crap.
U1BP42MRS : What was the hack?
U0NRYQNAZ : it's getting the url right in the dependency_links
U0NRYQNAZ : ```github_token = os.environ['GITHUB_TOKEN']
github_user = os.environ['GITHUB_USER']
. . .
dependency_links=[
       'git+https://{0}:x-oauth-basic@github.com/{1}/package.git/@master#egg=package-0.0.1'.format(github_token, github_user)
      ],
```

U1BP42MRS : Sounds about right. Nice hack <@U0NRYQNAZ> :taco:
U1BP42MRS : Oh sorry, guess I gave them all out
U0NRYQNAZ : what sucks is i had to use the --process-dependency-links
U0NRYQNAZ : and it gives a deprecation msg.
U0NRYQNAZ : it's all good
U0NRYQNAZ : so i'll have to change things soon... but whatever.
U0NRYQNAZ : it works right now and that is all i care about.
U1BP42MRS : I think there is an XKCD about the future self coming back to warn the past self...
U0NRYQNAZ : yea, it's already bugging me ... but i need to press on.
