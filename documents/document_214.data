U0ZEF0ERJ : Hello! All!We are providing a video call service(<http://roundee.io|roundee.io>) that returns the outcomes to the Slack channel such as title(text), date(text), attendee(text), recorded video file(link) and a transcript file(link) using Chat.PostMessage Method of WebAPI.
Now we want to add to provide a minutes file(pdf) to the Slack channel also, but I can't find a way to upload the pdf file to the channel.
If I use the Bot to upload the minutes file to the channel, I'm afraid that the speaker will be the first integrator, not our service name.
Is there any good solution for us?

U3FGRUSLT : what language are u using to call this api <https://api.slack.com/methods/files.upload> ? like is it golang or php or what are you coding in?
U3JGXARTM : I am using the botkit solution (nodejs) and I was wondering if there is way to use interactive message callbacks to update the original message (with the selected option for example). For now I have only managed to work with the selected options, but no user feedback can be provided.
U3JGXARTM : My question is concerning conversations - simple messages with a single response is not the problem
U3EFK8UES : <@U3JGXARTM> you could manually call the api method to edit the messgae yourself 
U3JUYM4QJ : Hello all! I'm an undergrad who would really like to explore the fundamentals of chatbots. I'm interested in working with botkit, and have been following this tutorial <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-studio-starter>. The issue is... I need to acquire a botkit studio token from <https://studio.botkit.ai/signup>. It would mean a great deal if anyone can send me an invite code. Thanks!
U0KECURAT : <@U3JUYM4QJ> just fyi: you don't need botkit studio to create a bot with botkit :slightly_smiling_face:
U3JUYM4QJ : <@U0KECURAT> ah okay, got stuck for a while.. this will help. Thank you!
U3JGXARTM : <@U3EFK8UES>: thanks. I will try this then.

U3C1KGJDD : Hey, I really need a hand to fix this. Can't redirect users to my messenger bot after user login thru passport. Been two days on the issue cannot have it right. My code is ```webserver.get('/auth/facebook',     passport.authenticate('facebook',{ scope: ['email'],
    session: true
    })
    );

webserver.get('/auth/facebook/callback', 
  passport.authenticate('facebook'), (req, res) =&gt; {
    var messengerApp = '<https://m.me/appUserName>';
    res.redirect( '/');
});

webserver.get('/', function( req, res ){
  res.header( 'Content-Type', 'text/html' );
  res.status(200).send('&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;a href="/auth/facebook"&gt;Login with Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;');
});```

U3C1KGJDD : If I change  `res.redirect( '/');` to `res.redirect( messengerApp);` the Login just won't happen
U3C1KGJDD : If someone could just tell me how I can work this out, it will save my day
U0HBN0L9M : 1) shouldn't the callback be a post ?2) can you clarify the use case ? why should users log in with facebook before being directed to the bot ? The m.me adress is public anyhow. It's hard to understand the benefit to go this route
3) Messenger has opened a way to login _in the bot_. Is it something you could explore ? That would look more natural

U3C1KGJDD : Hi <@U0HBN0L9M> ,I'm basically following the passport guide, where the callback is a get request.  I'm having the user to login to fetch info from the profile, but the user should not have to manually come back to the convo
U3C1KGJDD : I m not sure which solution you re referring to in 3)
U3C1KGJDD : I found that the only way to login would be to manually build the login flow as explained here <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow> but this is beyond my understanding, I'm a total noob
U0HBN0L9M : <@U3C1KGJDD> OK for the GET. OK also for the 3) - I have not tried it myself, just know that it exists, and I agree docs are confusing. But as far as your app is concerned, I still think you don't need passport
U0HBN0L9M : Messenger gives you access to some profile info
U0HBN0L9M : <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/user-profile>
U0HBN0L9M : Messenger gives you a scoped ID. In theory, you shouldn't need to have access to the "real" profile unless your app is super specific
U3C1KGJDD : <@U0HBN0L9M>  From what I understand there is a way to use Facebook Account Linking to make in-app (in-bot) Login, but I didn't manage to do it, which is why i m using simple Facebook Login. I actually need user's friends, photos and pinned locations, which requires login. I could have it work, my question is really how should I tweek the code above to have the user redirected to the conversation after login. I don't think it's that complicated but couldn't find any doc on the Web and i'm lacking knowledge of PAssport to figure it out by myself
U3KQ1RY22 : Hello, I want to know if it is possible to upload an image using the API without having a preview of that image in the channel where it is upload, Thanks
U0XRM115M : May the force be with Carrie Fisher
U0KECURAT : <@U3KQ1RY22> you can turn it off I believe
U3FGRUSLT : anyone have any experience with <https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/21/how-le-wagon-is-quietly-becoming-a-major-coding-bootcamp-in-europe/> ?
U0HBN0L9M : <@U3FGRUSLT> I have not done their program, but I know them quite well
U0HBN0L9M : what is your question ?
U0HBN0L9M : I actually gave a talk on conversational apps with them (in :fr:) <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA_2Za0uOhU>
U3KQ1RY22 : <@U0KECURAT> Do you have any idea?  there is nothing about that documented in the api
U3FGRUSLT : <@U0HBN0L9M> I'm wondering if anyone here knows a person considering doing a MBA program in the Los Angeles area. I've been teaching people programming for the last few months but my problem is the students don't take it seriously. I want a student like <https://medium.com/le-wagon/so-you-want-to-be-a-computer-programmer-ad9fe1b9d5b2>
U0KECURAT : <@U3KQ1RY22> try setting `unfurl_media: false`
U3KQ1RY22 : <@U0KECURAT>  I think it only works for`chat.postmessage`, I  tried adding it as a parameter  for `files.upload` , but have had no success
U3KH9BW1J : I'm looking to build a slack bot, for eventual Slack App. It will mostly engage via direct message, and some channels, but mostly DM. I'm looking for the most popular RTM python github library I can use to start with. It seems there are several options. Does anyone have a preference/recommendation
U3KH9BW1J : ?
U04S3JCH2 : Definitely check out <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> :slightly_smiling_face:
U04S3JCH2 : <http://github.com/howdyai/botkit|github.com/howdyai/botkit>
U3KH9BW1J : <@U04S3JCH2> Is there python for botkit?
U04S3JCH2 : sorry didn't read python there!
U04S3JCH2 : :stuck_out_tongue:
U04S3JCH2 : oops
U3KH9BW1J : :confused:
U0V93GE5R : slack made this fwiw <https://github.com/slackhq/python-rtmbot>
U3KH9BW1J : <@U0V93GE5R> Thank you, I was just looking at that. I'm looking for something well supported. I think I'll go this route since it's official. Thank you
U3KH9BW1J : <@U0V93GE5R> What I don't fully understand is it seems <https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient> has rtm support too
U3KH9BW1J : <@U0V93GE5R> why one versus the other? Hmm
U07CW6N3A : I would recommending going with `python-slackclient` over `python-rtmbot`... most bots end up needing to do more than things then strictly vanilla bot stuff, and may as well already be ready to use other aspects of the slack platform with ease than to box yourself in.
U3KH9BW1J : <@U07CW6N3A> Sold, it does seem more active. Yeah, I want the option to expand if necessary. Thank you!
U0V93GE5R : Im not a python guy, so listen to episod :smile:
U3KH9BW1J : <@U0V93GE5R> thank you anyways :slightly_smiling_face:
U3KHRQLTX : Web API allows for sending images in slack, but RTM does not, can someone confirm? Thank you :slightly_smiling_face:
U07CW6N3A : <@U3KHRQLTX> correct, there's no way to upload a file (including images) using the RTM API alone. You could include a remote URL to an image within the string component of the message via RTM API, but to actually upload an image you'll need to use `files.upload` from the Web API. If you need to do any kind of advanced message formatting (including message attachments, buttons, etc) you'll need to use something like `chat.postMessage` from the Web API as well.
U3KHRQLTX : <@U07CW6N3A> Thank you. I believe if I include a remote URL in string, it has to show up in the message. Whereas, a files.upload with Web API would allow a message plus image uploaded (without showing the URL). Correct?
U07CW6N3A : <@U3KHRQLTX> correct... though the "message" produced by `files.upload` isn't quite purely a message the same way other messages are. For most users, it's close enough but if we're really splitting hairs, `files.upload` results in a file object being created and a _side effect_ of that is something very much like a message object being produced in the channel it was uploaded to/shared to, displaying that image.
U07CW6N3A : An alternative that is more purely a message is to use the `image_url` attribute of a message attachment (as part of creating a message with `chat.postMessage`), pointing to a URL you control: <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments>
U3KHRQLTX : <@U07CW6N3A> Perfect, thank you. I think image_url is what I'm after.
U3KHRQLTX : Not sure who to report this to, but in creating an app, the pop up screen that asked me to create the app is cut off. <http://screencast.com/t/Vbxc8RuFnQj> Macbook Air 11". I hacked the CSS with margin-top: -500px; so that I could scroll it up
U272P5K71 : <@U3KHRQLTX> what resolution are you running?
U3KHRQLTX : <@U272P5K71> default <http://screencast.com/t/YjWnjbBX>
U272P5K71 : weird, that should be tall enough… are you zoomed?
U3KHRQLTX : <@U272P5K71> Strange, I'm not zoomed. I'm pretty sure I have default settings. Any other tests / settings you'd like me to check?
U3KHRQLTX : <@U272P5K71> eg. ctrl+0 doesn't change anything, normally it would if I was zoomed
U3KHRQLTX : <@U07CW6N3A> Quick question, I have this Web API call: <https://bpaste.net/show/0eaeae69182f> - I have this scope: identify,emoji:read,im:read,channels:write,chat:write:bot,im:write ... I keep seeing my messages get sent through slackbot with my bots username. I want my bots username to have it's own tab/window under DIRECT MESSAGES. Is there something I'm missing here?
U3KHRQLTX : I've tried setting username with as_user=False, too
U3KHRQLTX : And I have a bot user under my app, too
U3KHRQLTX : It seems adding the new bot under bot integration added the bot to my team, but my messages aren't being sent through the bot. I think I need  the bot's token, although I'm not getting it returned during oauth. Maybe I need a special scope. /me digs
U3KHRQLTX : Yeah, during oauth, I don't seem to get bot_access_token back. I bet if I postMessage with that, it'll work
U07CW6N3A : <@U3KHRQLTX> make sure you request the `bot` user scope during that flow, then in the OAuth access token response you'll get a bot token in addition to a standard user token (bot token is just for your bot, user token represents the user installing your app).    There are also some tricks with using the `as_user` parameter when posting messages that makes things extra confusing. Start with getting the bot user token though, and then use that with `chat.postMessage`.
U3KHRQLTX : <@U07CW6N3A> Thank you, I see "bot" on <https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-scopes> now... under "Slack app scopes" – I overlooked that. Appreciate the tip
U07CW6N3A : You may find you don't need or want all the other "decomposed" scopes like `chat:write:bot` -- a bot user token can use all the methods listed on the <http://api.slack.com/bot-users#api_usage|api.slack.com/bot-users#api_usage> index. If you need to use a method _not_ listed there, that's when you need to ask for the correlating scope and then use the user token instead of the bot token to accomplish it.
U3KHRQLTX : <@U07CW6N3A> thank you. Only issue, although minor now, is that my bot is named mybot_dev, and I think when I added the bot to my custom integration, it is mybot_dev2. I deleted the custom integration bot, and I also deleted it from my app and deleted my app, made new app, oauth'd, and the username is still mybot_dev2
U3KHRQLTX : It'd be nice to remove mybot_dev2 to be mybot_dev, if possible
U07CW6N3A : <@U3KHRQLTX> that stuff gets tricky with naming conflicts like that. if you reach out to the support team, they might be able to help you clean it up. <https://slack.com/help/requests/new>
U3KHRQLTX : <@U07CW6N3A>: thank you 
U3KEQNP5Z : Hello  people, I am writing an app on slack and using interactive  message buttons. When i click the button then my server is hit but i don't see any data in post params there.  I have followed the slack doc <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-buttons>
U3KEQNP5Z : I am using php lang and $_POST in action url doesn't have any data
U07VCKRUK : Is the trouble during the URL verification/challenge, or with the button action itself?  
If the former (challenge), try something like this:

```
&lt;?php

    $data = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'), true);
    $challenge = $data['challenge']; 
    $token = $data['token']; 
    echo $challenge; 
?&gt; 
```

U07VCKRUK : ^ <@U3KEQNP5Z> (if that's not it, please open a help request at <https://slack.com/contact> and someone on the platform support team will lend a hand)
U3KHRQLTX : <https://bpaste.net/show/83008a6ec214> – why is "event" a list? is it possible there could be multiple items in this list if there are multiple events that happen within a second, or something?
U3EFK8UES : One read give ones event
U3EFK8UES : afaik
U3J8A8RS4 : added an integration to this channel: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/services/B3KTJP79A|outgoing-webhook>
U3KHRQLTX : <@U3EFK8UES> Thank you. It returns a list... I'm not sure why else it returns a list?
U3KHRQLTX : Q1. With the slackclient, so I need a new rtm connection for every team that is using my slack bot, right? eg. 30 teams, means 30 different daemons or scripts constantly monitoring for messages. <http://slackapi.github.io/python-slackclient/real_time_messaging.html#rtm-events>
U3KHRQLTX : Q2. I see <http://users.info|users.info> returns timezone as "Pacific Standard Time" when I want "US/Pacific" (something arrow/datetime are more familiar with). Is there a slack mapping of sorts, so that I can do this with every timezone? Or perhaps there is something in python I'm missing here. Can anyone shed light on this? Thank you
U3KHRQLTX : I can't figure out timezone string based off offset... hmm
