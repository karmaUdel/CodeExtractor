  (list 'new 'clojure.lang.LazySeq (list* '^{:once true} fn* [] body)))```
why is fn* preferred here~? is it some performance concern, as fn* is the basic one?
right, destructuring is defined in terms of lazy-seq
so lazy-seq can't use fn, which destructures
source of fn shows you how it builds the form for fn*  - it does many things, some of which are lazy seq generating
I will try to read the source of fn~ I probably digged too deep of the dark magics, as I just started learning Clojure~
