U4F64AKQV : <@U2FJ2D6M7> the original problem was that `renderWords` returns a List of Html. This creates a problem in your `view` though, because we can't nest multiple levels of children when creating Html.
U4F64AKQV : If you call the function as you did, it will attempt to put the list of rendered words as a child of the top level `div`. You do not want that though.
U4F64AKQV : You want to add everything _inside_ the returned list to the child list of the top-level div
U4F64AKQV : Ah, actually there's another problem before that one.
U4F64AKQV : You really want something like this…```
renderWords sentence =
    let
        words =
            String.split " " sentence
    in
        List.map renderWord words


view model =
    div []
        (input [ placeholder "Text to proof", onInput NewContent, myStyle ] [])
        :: renderWords model.content
```

U5V0HVAKB : how thats pretty genius to destructuring with ::
U5V0HVAKB : :slightly_smiling_face:
U5V0HVAKB : gj
U5V0HVAKB : i will explain a bit more tell me if i am wrong <@U4F64AKQV>.
U5V0HVAKB : div [] [] the last one is a list
U5V0HVAKB : by writing ```
 (input [ placeholder "Text to proof", onInput NewContent, myStyle ] [])
        :: renderWords model.content
```
its the same if you write so 1 :: [2, 3, 4]

U5V0HVAKB : so that's why it should work
U4F64AKQV : It also becomes easier to see when you write type annotations.
U5V0HVAKB : but its should not be ``` 
div [] [
(input [ placeholder "Text to proof", onInput NewContent, myStyle ] [])
        :: renderWords model.content
]
```

U4F64AKQV : Alternatively, you could have passed the entire output of `renderWords` to `div []`
U4JT89FGB : Has anyone had luck getting `Go to definition` reliably working with Elm in VS Code?
U5V0HVAKB : u didnt miss the second [] from the high level div ?
U5V0HVAKB : oh no i am wrong because the an array of list
U4F64AKQV : <@U5V0HVAKB> What is the type of `div`? What is the type of `(input... ) :: renderWords model.content`?
U5V0HVAKB : ye i am wrong
U5V0HVAKB : div : List (Attribute msg) -&gt; List (Html msg) -&gt; Html msg
U5V0HVAKB : that's look really sexy ^^ i like this
U5V0HVAKB : <@U4JT89FGB> i dont think u have a function path finding in vs code like in phpstorm
