U04S1QCPC : that sounds like a bug <@U0CS6NSF5>, we'll fix it.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U04S1QCPC> :ok_hand:
U0CS6NSF5 : it seems like you could also allow users to enable/disable commands from the integration settings
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U04S1QCPC>, found another bug, so I'm going to start sending them through help
U04S1QCPC : :thumbsup:
U0DPYD3LH : <@U0CNYC404>: just looking at <http://converse.ai|converse.ai>, sounds appealing
U0CNYC404 : <@U0DPYD3LH>: awesome, looking forward to launching it tomorrow, just furiously finishing off 8 blog posts to do a feature dive :simple_smile:
U0DPYD3LH : cool, looking forward to it. I'm sure you'll post links when done
U0CNYC404 : will do, out of interest, what kind of things are you looking to build?
U0CNYC404 : ah, just read your intro in the other channel, well hopefully Converse can make that a little easier :simple_smile:
U09M38XH6 : nice work on the oauth scopes. i'm wondering if there's a mapping from id -&gt; integration outside of a call to `rtm.start` (the RTM API)? i.e., `rtm.start` returns:```
{
    [...]
    "bots": [
        {
            "id": "B03Q19VQQ",
            "deleted": false,
            "name": "github",
            "icons": {
                "image_48": "https:\/\/slack.global.ssl.fastly.net\/5721\/plugins\/github\/assets\/bot_48.png"
            }
        },
    [...]
}
```
i'd rather not request `client` scope from users as that's overkill. `<http://users.info|users.info>` and other obvious APIs don't return integrations/bots from what i can tell.

U0CS6NSF5 : <@U09M38XH6>, there are no endpoints to get info about bots
U09M38XH6 : <@U0CS6NSF5>: too bad :confused:. thanks!
U09M38XH6 : is there a place to file feature requests &amp; api bugs?
U0CS6NSF5 : send a message via the the <https://my.slack.com/help/requests/new>
U09M38XH6 : got it, thanks again
U0CS6NSF5 : I found that to be the best to file these kind of things
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U09M38XH6>, I mentioned that over a year ago already, btw XD
U0CS6NSF5 : even before the RTM API existed
U0CS6NSF5 : there actually was an undocummented method back in the day, but apart from being undocummented, the info it returned was incomplete
U09M38XH6 : ha! well, i filed a feature request, let's see what happens...
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U04S1QCPC>: when doing a delayed response to a Slash command, are you supposed to respond to the initial request too?
U0CS6NSF5 : s/supposed/required/
U0554MQJB : <@U04S1QCPC> <@U04SS2NBF> quick feedback on the new OAuth: Having more granular OAuth permissions is good, I think when done right this will lower the bar for some companies to auth in apps. I think the UI for showing what permissions an app is asking for could be done a bit better. The net effect seems to be that it is better to ask for wider permissions, because asking for fine grained ones creates a long scary list for the user. Maybe combining more permission requests in a smaller form factor or removing the yellow warnings would have the desired effect.
U04S1QCPC : <@U0CS6NSF5>: at minimum an empty 200 is required on the initial response
U04S1QCPC : <@U0554MQJB>: we're working on exactly what you mentioned at the end (combining similar-ish things), should be out soon hopefully.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U04S1QCPC>, reporting another bug then xD
U0CT5CWHZ : Dear Channel, As a non-tech person I have a fairly newbie question to ask to you: Is there a way i can add a bot to a specific slack channel that will tell each member to perform a specific task-Log your time spent on projects-each and every work day? Please send me a DM if you have a suggestion. Thank you very much in advance.
U07UXKV0A : Good work on the add to slack for /slash commands, going to see if I can wire it into Acktodo today (and tomorrow).
U07UXKV0A : Just waiting for OAuth of _outgoing_ webhooks now :smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U07UXKV0A>: just be aware there's some problem and delayed responses are sometimes being dropped :simple_smile:
U0AQ8GPGR : I hope it's fine to "advertise" in this channel a little bit :innocent: 
Anyone interested in participating in a Monthly Bot Challenge?

<https://botwiki.org/monthly-bot-challenge> 

U07UXKV0A : <@U0CS6NSF5>: Ah, good to know, I'll keep monitoring/tracking on and see what happens, ty.
U06E352LU : i was looking at the new announcement regarding slack command and the example of lyft.But I see nothing to define command with place holder like `/lyft  ride &lt;pickup&gt; to &lt;dropoff&gt;`
its still up to us (devs) to parse whatever comes after the command and find what to do ?

U0CNYC404 : <@U06E352LU>: That was my understand yeah, which is why I'm quite excited about it, as we can help solve that problem :simple_smile:  Fan of the work you guys do with APITools btw :simple_smile:
U06E352LU : ahah thanks <@U0CNYC404> :wink:
U0CNYC404 : A big part of what makes Converse tick is Lua based :simple_smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U06E352LU>: yep, it's up to you to parse the message
U06E352LU : well then..nothing new.. beside “add to slack” :stuck_out_tongue: thanks <@U0CS6NSF5>
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U06E352LU>: did they have the delayed replies before already?
U0CS6NSF5 : I hadn't looked closely at slash commands since it required manual setup
U06E352LU : oh yes.. delayed replies too
U0CS6NSF5 : I thought so, since they were failing frequently in my tests :simple_smile:
U04S6E9EW : Isn't it advantageous to not use slash commands so that others can see / learn the commands you're invoking?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U04S6E9EW>: your responses to Slash  commands ca be with `response_type` `in_channel` and then everybody in the channel can see the command and the response :simple_smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : a good example is `/giphy`
U04S6E9EW : ah, roger.
U0CNYC404 : In case anyone missed it.  Launched Converse beta today <http://www.converse.ai> more info at <http://blog.converse.ai> as well :)
U0CSBGTKM : congrats!
U0CNYC404 : Thanks <@U0CSBGTKM> :)
U04S3JCH2 : yeah!! congrats <@U0CNYC404> :clap:
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0CNYC404>: congrats
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0CNYC404>: high five to fellow UK company developing on top of the Slack API ;D
U0CNYC404 : <@U0CS6NSF5>: thanks 
U0CNYC404 : <@U04S3JCH2>: thanks :)
U0CS6NSF5 : quick update, I just got notified delayed respones to slash commands are fixed and I tried it myself and seems OK
U053NQZN1 : <@U0CNYC404>: are you guys using <http://wit.ai|wit.ai> under the hood? Or did you write all of this yourself? Either way, nice work!
U0CNYC404 : <@U053NQZN1>: we played with wit to begin with but found it lacking.  It's a combination of internal code and some external services but moving more and more of internal.  We do now have our own NLP parser in testing, but the system is designed to easily integrate with others if desired
U053NQZN1 : thats great! well done
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0CNYC404>, I've got a friend in Edinburgh who had a company doing NLP too :simple_smile:
U0CNYC404 : <@U0CS6NSF5>: cool, to be fair NLP is cool, but isn't where we feel we make the big difference, it's in the integration and conversation/context area right now at least.. :)
U0CNYC404 : <@U0CS6NSF5>: who was it out of interest?
U0CS6NSF5 : Skyscanner's CPO, they were doing hotel searches with NLP
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0CNYC404>: ^^
U0DJZMV7G : Congrats <@U0CNYC404>! I read your blog. Really interesting and exciting stuff!
U0DJZMV7G : I've a question, and please don't take it the wrong way :simple_smile:
U0DJZMV7G : Why is it better to use <http://converse.ai|converse.ai> vs an open source bot engine like SuperScript <http://superscriptjs.com/> ?
U0DJZMV7G : I'm not trying to be a smart-ass :simple_smile:
U0DJZMV7G : just curious
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0CNYC404>: by “they” I mean his company pre-Skyscanner :simple_smile:
U0DJZMV7G : SuperScript seems to have a pretty cool engine to describe conversation flows and triggers using NLP and custom user-code predicates
U0DJZMV7G : I assume one could build a Stripe plugin for it too
U0DJZMV7G : I haven't seen a good answer for human/machine hybrids, so that might be challenging with SuperScript. Btw, I think that's a really cool part of <http://converse.ai|converse.ai>
U0DJZMV7G : As a bot developer I have to spin up my own server anyway to implement web-hooks for whatever business-logic my app needs. Say I'm building a travel product, I need some webhooks to place orders or get itinerary information; So the question then is, what chat frontend should I put on top of this API? <http://Converse.ai|Converse.ai> looks great for that, but at the same time SuperScript and other open source chat bots might be a good fit too.
U0CNYC404 : <@U0DJZMV7G> I'm not familiar with superscript so will need to read up on it before I give a  sensible answer :). I'll come back to you tomorrow if that's ok.
U0CNYC404 : <@U0DJZMV7G> I'm going to release a video shortly demonstrating the human machine hybrid piece
U0DJZMV7G : Thanks! I appreciate it!
U0CNYC404 : <@U0CS6NSF5>: interesting didn't know that, the CTO and CEO of Skyscanner are friends so I will dig into that and come back to you. I did see their release for Alexa today which is interesting (I'm about half way through an integration with Skyscanner for flights as a side project)
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0CNYC404>: cool
U04SM6T2H : hey <@U0CNYC404> fyi <http://converse.ai|converse.ai> doesn't serve your site just <http://www.converse.ai|www.converse.ai>
U0CNYC404 : <@U04SM6T2H>: thanks, thought I'd fixed that, will get it sorted :)
U06UZ1RKQ : hey, quick question. DO you if it's possible to change a bot's profile pic on slack programatically?
U0CNYC404 : depending on how it's integrated yeah, you can send it in with the request each time, you can even change it's name on the fly
U0CNYC404 : thats with a generic webhook, with the addtoslack button it's far more restricted
U0CS1G8H3 : quick question for you friends: is it possible to set a slackbot's icon like you can with incoming webhooks? (see: <https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks>)
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0CS1G8H3>: depends on the API, with chat.postMessage you can, with the RTM API no
U0CS1G8H3 : <@U0CS6NSF5>: thanks
U0CS6NSF5 : np :simple_smile:
U0CS4BM4G : hmm.. can you create a bot user with an API call and set the icon for the bot user programatically?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0CS4BM4G>: you cannot create bot users with the API
U0CS6NSF5 : bots require manual configuration and copy&amp;pasting tokens right now
U0CS4BM4G : ah, ok cool :smile: thanks ernesto
U0CS6NSF5 : np :simple_smile:
U07060PG9 : This is :+1: <https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/662363402581377024>
U0D7C5RAL : Though there are avenues for mischief, as some of my coworkers have explored.
U0D8TNYDU : Does anyone know of a Superscript-like framework for Ruby? (Nothing against Superscript, I'm just hoping to use similar basic NLP in a  monolithic system.)
U0DJGSBRC : i'm a heavy user of /remind that's great it become mature
U04S09GLN : There is an incredibly small screenshot of our company using slack in this article that we have in the latest magazine, apparently: <http://www.wsj.com/articles/slack-ceo-stewart-butterfield-on-changing-the-way-we-work-1446689564?alg=y>
U0CSRV1TR : Just got access to Howdy… it is really slick… well done!
U0CSRV1TR : I am curious how the code is structured to support both command-and-reponse as well as conversation flow
U0CSRV1TR : Most of the example bot code is just plugin based which doesn't fit the conversation model well
U0E1NNCRZ : hey all!
U0E1NNCRZ : oh hmm <@U0CSRV1TR>  how did you get access to howdy? I'm still stuck in line
U0CSRV1TR : Yup… only 2 or 3 weeks wait
U0E1NNCRZ : oh ok, wasn't sure if the line was moving cuz the number hadn't changed haha
U0E1NNCRZ : if only it was open sourced then I could just boot my own server haha
U04SM6T2H : <@U0CSRV1TR>: we have built a system to handle and operate the conversational aspects
U04SM6T2H : Everything is really a conversation 
U04SM6T2H : Some of them are just shorter or less interactive 
U0CSRV1TR : <@U04SM6T2H>: and does the bot have multiple threads to responsively handle conversations with multiple people at the same time? For us, some plugin calls can take a few seconds (at least how it is now) and it is all single threaded
U04SM6T2H : We're using Node
U04SM6T2H : so we can do a lot of things asynchronously
U0CSRV1TR : right… cool
U04S3JCH2 : <@U0E1NNCRZ>: send me an email at <mailto:eric@howdy.ai|eric@howdy.ai> and I'll bump you up in line :simple_smile:
U04S3JCH2 : ^ that goes for anyone else in here too!
U0E1NNCRZ : i nagged ben and he bumped me already :)))
U0E1NNCRZ : haha
U0E1NNCRZ : thanks!
U0E2TU2SY : someone can tell me what is this channel for ?
U04S6E9EW : <@U0E2TU2SY>: Developing bots for use with Slack.
U04SM6T2H : This has nothign to do with bots but… I wrote an essay this weekend on how we're trying to do stats differently for Howdy and it is a nerdy, programmery post that you might enjoy...
U04SM6T2H : <https://medium.com/p/2956f88115f6/edit>
U06B18V25 : I have something else to talk to you about...
U04SM6T2H : that's still in draft mode, so if anyone has any feedback i'd love to hear it :simple_smile:
U0D8TNYDU : <@U04SM6T2H>: It left me curious about correlating stats (e.g. messages sent with referred from Analytics) and about security of that stats endpoint.
U0D8TNYDU : <@U04SM6T2H>: very nice idea, though :simple_smile:
U0CNYC404 : <@U04SM6T2H>: Looks good, we were actually discussing something similar internally for tracking certain things in Google Sheets, but yours is cleverer.  We have a search/query section in our API, must see if I can plug those two together
U04SM6T2H : Thanks folks!
U04SM6T2H : Apprevciate the eyeballs!
U0AQ8GPGR : <@U04SM6T2H>: Just added Howdy to our team :simple_smile: Looking forward to giving it a try!
U04SM6T2H : <@U0AQ8GPGR>: cool I'll bump ya
U04SM6T2H : <http://nymag.com/following/2015/11/12-weirdest-funniest-smartest-twitter-bots.html>
U06B18V25 : I have something else to talk to you about...
U0AQ8GPGR : <@U04SM6T2H>: Thanks!
U0AQ8GPGR : <@U04SM6T2H>: Haha, love the "Turn your bot on" screen :simple_smile:
U0AQ8GPGR : I'm going to have to play with the bot a bit more later, but I really like the onboarding, and the dashboard :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : thanks!
U0CSBGTKM : is there a way to track our Howdy Bot's usage?
U0CSBGTKM : e.g. number of checkins done, etc.
U05334HCE : Hey folks. Some friends and I made an emoji puzzle game in slack for the Node Knockout competition. You can check it out (and even vote if you like it!) here: <https://memoji.mod.bz/>
U0BSHTG0P : heyo anyone else having problems this morning?
U0BSHTG0P : it appears im unable to reestablish connections with my bots at all
U0BSHTG0P : INFO connecting then throwing uncaught unspecified error
U0BSHTG0P : weird…nm
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0BSHTG0P>: RTM API looks OK from our side
U0CS6NSF5 : the REST API response times have gone up, though
U0CS6NSF5 : all responses in the past 12 hours were 200 OK except one 504, so it's slow but working
U0D7LHNTX : <@U0CS6NSF5>: Are you still experiencing slow API response times? Is anyone else? We're not observing anything currently on our end, but I can dig a bit if this is turning out to be an issue.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0D7LHNTX>, I've got an open ticket from a few weeks ago regarding latency speaks already
U0CS6NSF5 : one of your colleagues was trying to get some timing info end to end rather than just from the app server
U0D7LHNTX : Found the ticket. Thanks for the heads-up
U0CS6NSF5 : my pleasure, happy to help :simple_smile:
U0CNYC404 : For any bay area people, I'm going to be around next week Sun-Thur if anyone wants to meet up and talk bots/chatops/messaging/etc :simple_smile:
U0DBP0CBF : Would love to!
U0CNYC404 : Awesome, will message you to work out a time 
U06MHAMFT : Hi folks, do the new OAuth scopes described at <https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/new-and-improved-oauth-scopes-4894b2cc159d> apply to on-boarding of  bots that use the RTM API? So far we've been telling users to create a bot user and give us the API token. Is that still the flow even after this OAuth update?
U0D0RC0AZ : does anyone know if it's possible to circumvent slack's own onboarding process with slackbot? we want to build our own onboarding bot instead.
U0D7C5RAL : I'll be curious of the Slack onboarding could be extended to cover the new custom profile fields options.(Ideally we're hoping to be able to import from Google Contacts into Slack so it's an automatic process, but we haven't explored it *yet*)

U0DBP0CBF : <@U0D7C5RAL>: what do you mean by import from Google Contacts into Slack? Like invite a set of people from Google into your Slack team?
U0D7C5RAL : Importing data, I think is more the idea. As in, we have Google Apps for Work for the company, so in our onboarding process data's already going in there. We'd like to avoid adding more steps to onboarding for manual data entry (And keeping things synced would be handy), but having the data available in Slack would be useful.Since we're using domain sign-on &amp; Google Auth, there should be a 1:1 mapping between Google Contacts data and Slack profiles.

U0CS6NSF5 : <@U06MHAMFT>: that's still the way, yes, no way to attach a bot to your application yet
U0D7C5RAL : (Alternately, extending Slackbot's default onboarding to ask things like *Who is your manager?* *What department are you in?*, *What team are you on?* would be the manual equivalent)
U06MHAMFT : thanks <@U0CS6NSF5>
U06MHAMFT : <@U0D7C5RAL>: I think it's a good idea what you're trying to do, but FYI, technically speaking the user profile fields that go together with each user in Google Apps are not Contacts, but rather profile fields tied to the Google account. So what you're asking for is to actually pull profile info from a Google Account rather that from Google Contacts
U0D7C5RAL : Ah, gotcha. That makes sense. Thanks for the clarification there. `Google Account =&gt; Slack Profile`
U0CSJUB1D : I've been looking for a way to do this as well. We use OneLogin as our cloud directory as a service / single sign on (sudo LDAP) and we provision users out automatically to Google apps and Slack. However the Profile info has to be manually added in slack, but name, username, and email transfer perfectly. 
U0EADJJCA : So I've been waiting for the Howdy bot since it launched on PH. When might I expect our bot to be activated for my team?
U04S3JCH2 : <@U0EADJJCA>: DM me!
U0D0RC0AZ : Hi! I'm wondering if anyone knows of a way to circumvent having slackbot take a new user through the onboarding flow. We'd like to replace it with our own onboarding bot.
U0D0RC0AZ : One way I can think of would be to use the API to interact with slackbot (on "behalf" of the new user), then delete the channel history before the actual human user shows up.
U05560TFT : not that there's an API for it, but i bet if you filled in all the users details (as an admin) slackbot wouldn't bug them
U05560TFT : or if it did, it would be a “hey, i'm slackbot” message and not ask for name/picture etc
U0CNYC404 : <@U04S1QCPC>: any idea on this one?
U04S1QCPC : there isn't currently a way to override the slackbot onboarding flow – though, if you wanted to have your onboarding start immediately after the slackbot flow, you could listen for `user_change` events for new users as a proxy for when that finishes.
U0D0RC0AZ : Thanks for the ideas!
U0554MQJB : <@U04S1QCPC> any plans to open up a write api for user profiles and custom fields?
U04S1QCPC : yes!
U0EE7P2DQ : hey folks, thought id quickly introduce myself. i work on the partnerships team here at slack, mainly focused on the platform side of things (i sit right across from mr. :rose:). more importantly, i don't know what took me so long to join this community.
U0EF9A46Q : current place in line for Howdy is 1345--are request still being completed?
U04S3JCH2 : <@U0EF9A46Q>: send me a DM and I'll get you set up :simple_smile:
U04S1QCPC : <@U0554MQJB> i recall you having some feedback about how hard it is to add reactions; if you reload your slack, you'll see some improvements we made to make it a lot easier.
U0D7C5RAL : Wonderful
U0D6N6ZHD : this. this is good. <@U04S1QCPC> :heart_eyes:
U0EAC51EJ : My current place in line is 1373. Any idea how long to get setup?
U04S3JCH2 : <@U0EAC51EJ>: immediately if you DM me! :wink:
U04S3JCH2 : <@U0EF9A46Q>: yes! send me an email at <mailto:eric@howdy.ai|eric@howdy.ai> and I'll set you up.
U0554MQJB : <@U04S1QCPC>: looking good, if you really want to ramp up the engagement maybe allow multi-selecting emoji in the chooser that pops up
U0554MQJB : <@U04S1QCPC>: is there some type of treatment coming for mobile iOS? still no emoji call to action there
U04S1QCPC : maybe. :wink:
U04SM6T2H : <@U06B18V25>: look
U0EJEUZRD : I'm guessing that the Real Time Messaging API creates one WebSocket between my server and the Slack channel.  If I'm monitoring multiple Slack channels with a single web server, then there are multiple WebSockets open.
How many Slack channels can the average server on Heroku (or a similar platform) handle at once?  What are the factors which affect the load on the server and WebSocket the most–is it the number of Slack users connected to the channel or is it rate of the messages between them that matters?

U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0EJEUZRD>: the RTM API is per team rather than per channel
U0CS6NSF5 : with regards to how many web sockets you can handle with a Heroku server, it depends a lot on the language and libraries you use to make the connection
U0EJEUZRD : <@U0CS6NSF5>: Thank you for that clarification about team rather than channel.  I'm trying to get a grasp on a very rough estimate for how many WebSockets per server: 1/10/100/1000/etc.  Do channels with twice the amount of activity require twice the bandwidth?  I would guess so.
I will do it myself and share the results back here, but I was hoping that someone might already have an answer for a general estimate like that.

U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0EJEUZRD>: we run thousands per small dyno using Go and our own library
U0AFABJAJ : <@U0EJEUZRD>: I have seen (which I am trying to find) of 6000 websocket connections per dyno
U0EJEUZRD : <@U0CS6NSF5> and <@U0AFABJAJ>  Thanks–that is very helpful!  And it's great news to see that one server can handle so much.
U0AFABJAJ : <http://veldstra.org/2013/10/25/heroku-websocket-performance-test.html> (with Node)
U0CS6NSF5 : we do shard requests across different dynos to avoid having everything running in single dyno. That way any potential crash doesn't bring all the connections down
U0AFABJAJ : But like <@U0CS6NSF5> says, it definitely depends on the language (and code)
U0CS6NSF5 : also, bear in mind one thing, most of the info you are going to read about websockets and heroku talk about heroku as a websocket server rather than a client
U0EJEUZRD : Ok; thanks for that tip too.  Slackline looks awesome, by the way.  This is the first time I've heard about it.
U0CS6NSF5 : thanks :simple_smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : we haven't done much marketing yet
U0D9WRGDN : oh lord where do i complain about slack UI changes :disappointed: two clicks to edit a message? :disappointed:
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0D9WRGDN>: twitter?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0D9WRGDN>: if you are editing a message you just wrote you can also press “arrow up"
U0D9WRGDN : i write more than one line messages
U0D9WRGDN : but yeah, twitter probably
U0D6N6ZHD : you can edit more than one line messages by pressing arrow up
U07060PG9 : There is a Help &amp; Feedback link if you click on the team name in the left sidebar.  They respond same-day, usually.  I think that's better than twitter, personally.
U0D9WRGDN : thanks <@U07060PG9>, didn't see that before
U0CVB11NV : <@U04SM6T2H>: i've already activated my howdy bot. i'm wondering to use it?  he doesnt seem to be responding to my conversations.
U04S3JCH2 : <@U0CVB11NV>: I can help! DM'ing you. :simple_smile:
U0E9LFL3F : hi everybody. I'm coding my first slackbot, is this a general purpose place where to talk about this?
U0E9LFL3F : cause I got here after installing Howdy
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0E9LFL3F>: there's a <#C04SPC24T> channel
U0CS6NSF5 : if you have questions/issues with the slack api, there's <#C06V9K8JF> too
U0ETWQ8KA : Hey guys, just beggining to code a hubot over hubot-slack adapter and my JS/CS is really bad, can I ask something here?
U0CSBGTKM : is there a language you're more familiar with?
U0ETWQ8KA : spanish :stuck_out_tongue: I'm not really a programmer, that's the thing.
U0CSBGTKM : (though to answer your question, folks in <#C04SPC24T> have been pretty accommodating of any questions I've had)
U0CSBGTKM : oh gotcha hah
U0ETWQ8KA : yeah, been reading, will try to ask there, thanks <@U0CSBGTKM>
U0BGVHEPQ : <@U0ETWQ8KA> :wave: ¿has hecho algo antes con un Hubot?
U0ETWQ8KA : no realmente, no
U0AUV0U7P : hello all
U0AUV0U7P : I'm starting to open up an early preview of a conversational AI platform for slack bot developers
U0AUV0U7P : The system will allow you to easily add natural language and conversations to any bot that you're building, using a very simple web interface.
U0AUV0U7P : If you'd like to participate, just shoot me a DM
U055FHACC : is it <http://motion.ai|motion.ai> <@U0AUV0U7P>? 
U0CNYC404 : <@U055FHACC> no <@U0AUV0U7P> is Myra. <http://Motion.ai|Motion.ai> does look sweet though :)
U055FHACC : that makes three of yous.. 
U0CNYC404 : It's getting interesting :)
U0CRS2WV9 : Has anyone seen this error w trying to add a Slash command: `{"ok":false,"error":"tls_certificate_not_trusted"}` ? (I have a cert.)
U0F1Z87JT : Hey folks, how do you handle Slack rate limit?
U0563E81H : <@U0F1Z87JT>: We slow down :simple_smile: We try not to pass the limit even for a short while. So, first of all, we batch most of the text into a single message (users prefer that also, instead of a trillion dings). Then, we keep a last-sent-time per team, and requeue all messages that are sent too fast.
U0F1Z87JT : <@U0563E81H>: Which queue are you using?
U0563E81H : For that, just an internal one, nothing complex.
U04S6E9EW : Without storing users &amp; checking for changes, are there any ways to know if a user is new to the team?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U04S6E9EW>: no
U0D7C5RAL : You could track users joining <#C04SM6TAK>.
U04S6E9EW : It actually looks like there's a _team_join_ event that does what we're looking for.
U04S6E9EW : <https://api.slack.com/events/team_join>
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U04S6E9EW>: but it's not a method to query whether a user is new, you need to be connected when the event is triggered in order to know about it
U0CS6NSF5 : so you should still store and check for changes in case the user joins while you are disconnected
U0CS6NSF5 : if you want to know _when a user joins_ you can use team_join, but to check if a given user is “new” you'll have to store information, and you should probably store some information anyway
U04S6E9EW : neato.
U0AQ8GPGR : Good morning. Anyone interested in joining?
<https://twitter.com/botwikidotorg/status/668765083451957248>

U0CSBGTKM : oo
U09S0D71P : awesome!
U04SM6T2H : Not directly bot related but
U04SM6T2H : <http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/4834>
U0D7C5RAL : +1 for :slack: support, they're amazingly responsive.
U04SM6T2H : ^^ a huge archive of materials from Infocom, a pioneering company that made text adventure games
U0CSBGTKM : anyone else just see Slack belch a 503?
U0CS6NSF5 : yes
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0CSBGTKM>: what were you doing? you brought everything down! :stuck_out_tongue:
U0CSBGTKM : rm -rfv something something something...
U0CS6NSF5 : worst part is that being connectivity issues, all the clients and bots reconnecting might even make it worse
U0CS6NSF5 : specially since it seems connection drops, then you are able to reconnect and it then drops again, so at least my client is not doing much backoff
U0D7C5RAL : Welp. This team's back on now, at least.
U0CS6NSF5 : yep, they just aggressively rate limited teams, I'm guessing because of all the retries
U0CS6NSF5 : and they are allowing teams back in incrementally
U056UTFGB : hi. when you're building a chatbot to be used by other people - not just one that will be used inside your own team - what kinds of metrics / indicators are available to monitor if the thing you've built is working for the people using it?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U056UTFGB>: it depends on your bot
U0CS6NSF5 : same as with products
U056UTFGB : <@U0CS6NSF5>: Thanks. That makes sense.
U0CT32R88 : Hey all :simple_smile: we have just launched <http://plutio.com|plutio.com> - would really love your feedback! - Everything you need to manage your business, collaborate with  your teams and work closer with clients, all from one place.
U0F7VNC2Z : hi leobassam - I signed up, looks intriguing. However nothing seems to have happened. During sign up I was urged to tweet with your hash tag to get some magic. I've had zero feedback from the site or from twitter, so not sure what's going on there?
U0CT32R88 : hey <@U0F7VNC2Z> what is your email address? seem like we have a little problem with mailchimp!
U0FQHMRU3 : Hi everybody, I'm french a developper and co-founder of <http://Clubble.io|Clubble.io>, a email slack integration.
U0D6N6ZHD : <@U0FQHMRU3>: looks awesome! welcome. :simple_smile:
U0FQHMRU3 : <@U0D6N6ZHD>: Thank you very much !
U06E352LU : nicely done <@U0FQHMRU3> ! :simple_smile:
U0FQHMRU3 : We currently working on a bot integration: we have to maintain one websocket connection per team. The failure scenarios are hard to handle: if the system gets disconnected, we need to fetch back recent history to check if we missed something.Has anyone already dealt with that?

U0CSRV1TR : Yup... need some other persistent data store
U0FHTRT7F : <@U0FQHMRU3>:  Clubble looks very good. Congratulations. Do let us know what you have learnt in this process of building Clubble, like dos and donts
U0FQHMRU3 : <@U0FHTRT7F>: Thanks ! We currently work on the launch version of the service. We work on a bot system, no more administration backoffice on <http://clubble.io|clubble.io>. We tell you more in some days, promise !

U0FHTRT7F : That sounds interesting ! Good luck with it <@U0FQHMRU3>
U0AQ8GPGR : Work in progress: <http://getyoursidekick.org|getyoursidekick.org> !
U0D6N6ZHD : cool idea
U0AQ8GPGR : Thanks :simple_smile: Yeah, these features make things like managing a newsletter much easier :simple_smile:
U0BGVHEPQ : :clap:
U04S6E9EW : <http://nic.bot/>
U0AQ8GPGR : When I learned about Amazon buying the whole gTLD, a few months ago, I was really curious to see what they wanted to do with it.
I must admit I didn't expect this :simple_smile:  

U0CSRV1TR : Hey... my Howdy bot icon/avatar changed by itself... how did you do that?
U0G6S4L48 : i think it's delivered within the bot message now
U0G6S4L48 : hope it wasn't too traumatic to see your bot with a new face
U0G6S4L48 : the new avatars are contextual, though!
U0CSRV1TR : Not traumatic at all... I wanted to do something similar.
U0CSRV1TR : So it is the `icon_url` for this: <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage> ???
U0G6S4L48 : let me ask how they did it, one sec
U0CSRV1TR : ok thanks
U0G6S4L48 : the answer is yes
U0G6S4L48 : that's what we're using
U04SM6T2H : one downside:
U04SM6T2H : it comes in as a “Bot message” instead of a “user message"
U04SM6T2H : which has a few ramifications
U04SM6T2H : 1) no profile link/hover on user name
U04SM6T2H : 2) other bots don't hear it, unless they are set up to listen to bot messages
U04SM6T2H : but otherwise rad!!!
U0CSRV1TR : even if you set `as_user` to true?
U0E835401 : One other issue to be aware of is that we don't currently change when we surface the icon based on whether you changed it's value or not
U0E835401 : So for example if this message had a different icon than the previous one you wouldn't know
U0E835401 : We're thinking about what the right thing to do here is...
U0G6S4L48 : i guess "let bots spam icon changes" isn't the obvious choice
U0CSRV1TR : I would like a way for the bot to "style" itself
U0CSRV1TR : The current new bot page is in 2 steps - first is the username, 2nd gives you the API key and the fields to enter a first and last name, description and the avatar image
U0CSRV1TR : I get that this gives the most flexibility to the creator, but means the default bot styling is crappy... the bot should be able to set those fields for itself to save the creator from copy/pasting those values
U0GDB8J5V : Hi. Happy to join, I'm in love with bots. At <http://apidaze.io|apidaze.io> we built <http://ottspott.co|ottspott.co> and I recently gave a talk at API Days Paris. <http://fr.slideshare.net/lmbcgq/ottspott-by-apidaze-api-days-paris-2015>
U0FC6TFKP : <@U08FJ9CL8> do you guys use any bot framework at stacktodo?
U08FJ9CL8 : We use the Elixir language (based on the Erlang VM) with the Phoenix framework that has some quite good support for multiple channel communications, so have based quite a bit of our stuff on top of that.
U0FC6TFKP : cool! Thanks. I will look into Phoenix. But is it rule based?
U08FJ9CL8 : The phoenix framework is more of a general web / sockets stack rather than directly bot related - we've had to put together a rules engine on top of it
U0FC6TFKP : Oh, it is a web framework. I thought it is some sort of bot framework. Thanks for the clarification.
U08FJ9CL8 : Yep - there are some nice things from the Elixir language though - multiple agent processes map very well onto a bot environment :simple_smile:
U0A16QMP0 : <@U0FC6TFKP>: ive been working on a bot “framework” (if u can call it that) - <https://github.com/zerobotlabs/relax>
U0FC6TFKP : <@U0A16QMP0> thanks for sharing. I am not a Go person. But from the description of it, Relax makes each listening websocket (for different Slack teams consuming the 'same' bot) less resource consuming, right? We do have the pain of having to have a dedicated nodejs instance for each Slack teams using the same bot. Am I getting it right?
U0A16QMP0 : yes that's right
U0A16QMP0 : and you don't need to know go to run it
U0A16QMP0 : theres' an API that relax offers that can be used by any language
U0A16QMP0 : for e.g. here's a ruby client for relax: <https://github.com/zerobotlabs/relax-rb>
U0A16QMP0 : there's a nodejs client that i have been meaning to work on but haven't yet :simple_smile: is ur web stack in node?
U0FC6TFKP : yes it is in node.
U0AQ8GPGR : <https://twitter.com/botwikidotorg/status/676052990797725696>
U0A16QMP0 : there's pre-built binaries for relax available now, so u can run it locally alongside your web app without requiring go: <https://github.com/zerobotlabs/relax#installation>
U0CSRV1TR : That is very cool <@U0A16QMP0>. How is progress coming along on the pluggable messaging backends?
U0CSRV1TR : I would want to use a managed AWS service for that
U0A16QMP0 : <@U0CSRV1TR>: so by pluggable messaging backends i mean fb messenger, wechat etc — which other messenger service are u looking to integrate with?
U0CSRV1TR : Oh, to me that is the front-end for something like relax... I want to ingest the messages to something other than Redis... probably Kinesis
U0A16QMP0 : ah ic, yeah that should be more straightforward
U0A16QMP0 : it's a little tightly coupled to redis at the moment, but ive been meaning to loosen that constraint
U0D9WRGDN : <@U0CSRV1TR> just use elasticache redis :simple_smile:
U0A16QMP0 : or yeah that too :simple_smile:
U0CSRV1TR : HA... I know all too well that AWS hasn't put enough effort into that yet to call it HA
U04TLHGSC : <@U04SM6T2H> are you at this slack announcement tonight?
U04TLHGSC : Are you in it?
U04SM6T2H : <@U04TLHGSC>: both
U04TLHGSC : Tell us more!
U04SS2NBF : don't tell him more.
U04SS2NBF : :simple_smile:
U04S3JCH2 : hah
U0EAC51EJ : tell us more
U04S09GLN : link or it didn't happen
U04SM6T2H : I will periscope it :)
U0CSBGTKM : n00b question, but can you send messages to an entire private channel (similar to #&lt;channel&gt;)?
U0CSBGTKM : more specifically, can Howdy Bot be scheduled to work on a private channel?
U0G6S4L48 : should be able to run `schedule checkin with #private_channel`
U0G6S4L48 : from either a DM to the bot, if you want the results privately, or run that in the private channel to surface the end results to all the channel members
U0CSBGTKM : gives me "Uhoh, I didn't understand who you want me to schedule this with." each time
U0G6S4L48 : hmm, i'll look into it more. we may not have turned on scheduling w/ private channels yet.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0CSBGTKM>: is the bot in the private channel?
U0CSBGTKM : yup
U0CSBGTKM : tried a couple different channels (in case newly-created ones were causing the problem)
U0D7F12ER : that's huge news!
U0D7F12ER : (Maybe a good time to remind commercial bot makers that I am available to help with marketing/growth/data/etc.)
U0GNZMTEW : Any way to get faster access to howdy?
U0GNZMTEW : cc <@U04SM6T2H> :smirk:
U0BSHTG0P : <http://slackhq.com/post/134878632730/launch-platform>
U0BSHTG0P : :O
U04S3JCH2 : <@U0GNZMTEW>: send me an email (<mailto:eric@howdy.ai|eric@howdy.ai>) and I'll set you up!
U0GNZMTEW : sent <@U04S3JCH2> THanks!
U0GNZMTEW : Excited to try it out :smile:
U0CSRV1TR : This is very exciting!
U0CSRV1TR : I am so happy they expanded the Slack Button to include bot users!!!
U0CSRV1TR : That is going to make my tasks for next week much easier.
U0CSRV1TR : I haven't found any specifics on the Slack Fund... has anyone else?
U07HXFWUD : <@U0CSRV1TR>: If you are interested in funding please email <mailto:slackfund@slack.com|slackfund@slack.com>. We want to see hundreds of apps launch out of the fund and we can't wait to work with you!

U07HXFWUD : I love the visuals for <https://awesome.ai/>
U0CSRV1TR : Already emailed... thanks!
U07060PG9 : Thanks <@U07HXFWUD> I'll get you an invite out soon - would love your feedback.
U0GP7QN7L : sup folks
U0GP28JKZ : Hey :wave:
U04SM6T2H : :sunglasses:
U07HXFWUD : is this a caption contest :robot_face:
U07HXFWUD : good meme material right there
U0CNYC404 : <@U04SM6T2H>: bot kit is looking in good shape :)
U0GPSB7V1 : greetings fellow slack developers!
U0GPSB7V1 : may the slack be with you!
U0GPTQ81L : hello there!
U0GPSB7V1 : i'm a Go developer in Atlanta, GA and my latest bot is a pomodoro bot that responds to any message that starts with a :tomato:
U0GPSB7V1 : and then 20 minutes later or so reminds you to take a break and check your email :simple_smile:
U0GPTQ81L : Awesome, haha
U06U57P6E : Everyone is welcome to try the new Add to Slack workflow at <http://slack-bot-server.herokuapp.com>, Ruby code in <https://github.com/dblock/slack-bot-server>. The bot just responds to “hi”.
U0GQ20M9P : Hi everyone - hm I'm new to slack as well ... would have expected to have this hangout added to my corp slack account :thinking_face:
U07K5QQDN : Pulling all the news in from yesterday Slack rodeo and this sounds really good. Great going <@U04SM6T2H> and <@U04S3JCH2>! This is looking really good now.
I'm still trying to sort if there were things relevant to closing some gaps around the ability / ease of pulling related messages together and filtering. I've been running into a lot of mainstream folks who have bumped into Slack at work and are really lost and can't find what they need and pulling related threads together when they find a piece of what they need.

U0GQ4GVPY : hellooooo
U0GQ4GVPY : I'm Kailan and I'm from Cornwall in the UK. I'm pretty young but I program in most of the popular languages and do system administration.
U0GQ4GVPY : Good to be here :+1:
U07UXKV0A : Congratulations on the launch everyone, that's pretty sweet...
U07UXKV0A : …been waiting for this to dive back into Acktodo, now that there's a proper way to support it. Very excited.
U0GPSB7V1 : Question: I'm writing a bot that uses the RTM but the messages it sees have user IDs like U0A2E9FJQ so how do i turn those into handles i can use in replies?
U0GPSB7V1 : i have to use the web api, right?
U0GPSB7V1 : so my bot has to have an auth token for RTM and for web API?
U06U57P6E : You can render `&lt;@ID&gt;` and slack client will translate those into the usernames. Otherwise you have to ask slack for the user info for each ID.
U0GPSB7V1 : oh wow, didn't know that!
U0GPSB7V1 : cool
U0GPTQ81L : That's indeed pretty awesome!
U0GQ2JCCA : channels act the same btw :wink:
U0GPSB7V1 : so just have the bot type &lt;@U0A2E9FJQ&gt;
U06U57P6E : Yep. If you do want the username, in slack-gamebot I store that and also listen to `user_change` events (here: <https://github.com/dblock/slack-gamebot/blob/5003acb599aa8c47c6a0dab06abe4fa867b93756/slack-gamebot/hooks/user_change.rb>) and also update this info every time a user talks to the bot.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0GPSB7V1>: also, since you are using the RTM API, you would normally have all the users in memory which means you can get the user corresponding to that ID without using the REST API
U0GPSB7V1 : how would i get them in memory?
U0GQ4GVPY : You'd have to load them in through the web API
U0GPSB7V1 : oh, ok
U0GPSB7V1 : well, my pomodoro bot is working fine so far with just using the &lt;@id&gt; syntax
U0GQ4GVPY : <https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list>
U0GPSB7V1 : i don't know if that's mentioned in the RTM docs
U0GPSB7V1 : if it isn't, it should be! :simple_smile:
U0GQ2JCCA : oh it's in formatting i think
U0GQ4GVPY : <https://api.slack.com/docs/formatting>
U0GPSB7V1 : also, if a user id is U12335 then is the DM channel for them D12345?
U0GQ4GVPY : hm
U0GQ4GVPY : IIRC you just use the user ID
U0GQ4GVPY : so `U12335` should work
U0GQ4GVPY : Don't quote me on that though
U0GPSB7V1 : interesting
U0GPSB7V1 : ok
U0GPSB7V1 : in the “sending messages” section here <https://api.slack.com/rtm> it mentions DM channels starting with a D but i'll try the U and see what happens
U0GQ4GVPY : oh okay it probably is then
U0GQ4GVPY : ¯\_(?)_/¯
U0644KVQE : With the new bot functionality of the ‘Add to Slack' button, am I right in saying that the added/created bot is *not* automatically invited into any channel?
U0GQ4GVPY : I would assume that when you click the ‘Add to Slack' button you get to choose which channels to add the bot to
U0GPSB7V1 : they weren't invited to any channels automatically before, either
U0GPSB7V1 : also, when you invite a bot to a channel, they get a message on RTM that doesn't appear to be valid json...
U0GPSB7V1 : i just ignore it because the websocket/json libs in go surface the error to me about not being able to marshal the json into a string
U0G6ZCWES : Yes, the user gets to select the channel your integration will point to when they ‘Add to Slack"
U0644KVQE : <@U0GQ4GVPY> <@U0G6ZCWES> that's not what I'm seeing for a Slack App bot (using the new API) which doesn't also include any incoming web hook scopes
U04SS2NBF : We removed the auto-join in <#C04SM6TAK|general> based on lots of feedback from scaring teams that didn't know what was happening. The new recommendation is to have bots DM their installer with instructions on how to use the bot and how to invite them to channels. 
U04SS2NBF : But open to feedback on all of that. 
U0G6ZCWES : Oh interesting, I would guess you invite them like a normal user but I need to read up :simple_smile:
U0GQ4GVPY : &gt; The new recommendation is to have bots DM their installerThat is a great idea actually

U04SS2NBF : Yes. `/invite @botname`
U0G6ZCWES : ^this…smart
U0GQ4GVPY : <@U04SS2NBF>: So is there a way for a bot to find out who added it to a team?
U0644KVQE : I was just typing that question :simple_smile:
U04SS2NBF : Also, if your bot is using the RTM, the full users and channels list is sent as part of `rtm.start` so you don't need to call the Web API. 
U0GQ4GVPY : oh really? that's sweet
U04SS2NBF : <@U0GQ4GVPY>: you can use the `access_token` and call `auth.test` to get info about the installer. 
U0GQ4GVPY : ah, nice
U0GQ4GVPY : thanks
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0GPSB7V1>: <@U0GQ4GVPY> you don't need to load them via users.list, you'll get the list in rtm.start and will get updates via the websocket
U0CS6NSF5 : oops, just saw <@U04SS2NBF> replied already xD
U0GPSB7V1 : yeah, the library i'm using is relatively simple and doesn't have that implemented yet so i didn't see it :simple_smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : that's the way to do it, since it'll make sure you have a consistent list of users with the events you receive via websocket
U0GQ4GVPY : Will the RTM API send a message when a new user joins the team?
U0GQ4GVPY : or if a user edits their username/profile
U0GQ4GVPY : I remember making a bot that connected to the websocket before the RTM API was a thing and I think those kind of messages did get sent
U0CS6NSF5 : yes
U0GQ2JCCA : `user_change` for edits to username / profile
U0GQ2JCCA : new join is `team_join`
U0GQ4GVPY : cheers
U0CS6NSF5 : and it'll do it from the state you get from rtm.start
U0CS6NSF5 : which will help with consistency
U0GQ4GVPY : <@U0GQ2JCCA>: You think I should finally make Helper4?
U0GQ2JCCA : no you should use kira <@U0GQ4GVPY>
U0GQ4GVPY : oh yeahh true
U0GQ4GVPY : oh wait this is the wrong slack, gg
U0GPSB7V1 : i'm not quite able to grok something on the New App registration page
U0GPSB7V1 : <https://api.slack.com/applications/new>
U0GPSB7V1 : why do i have to specify a team name?
U0GQ4GVPY : Maybe the team that created the app? ¯\_(?)_/¯
U0G6ZCWES : hmmm, feels like designating it is like your play or itunes account, like it has to live under something.
U0GQ4GVPY : yeah
U0GPSB7V1 : the only team options are ones you have valid sessions open for in your web browser so i'll have to log in to tech404 or something in order to select that
U04SM6T2H : Welcome new folks!!
U0GPTQ81L : Thanks ben :simple_smile:
U0GQ4GVPY : Thanks ^+^
U04S3JCH2 : almost 600 folks in here!
U0GQ2JCCA : thank you :simple_smile:
U0GP7QN7L : bustling frontier town, here
U0CRS2WV9 : right
U0CSRV1TR : <@U06U57P6E>: the button works beautifully!
U0CSRV1TR : <@U0GPSB7V1>: When your client first connects to slack, slack responds with a deluge of information - one of which is the list of all users. Cache that somewhere and you can lookup the &lt;@UABCD1234&gt; there
U0GPSB7V1 : yeah, i'm going to end up implementing a whole new bot library in Go because the one i was using is pretty limited...
U0GQ4GVPY : Has anyone here written a bot that people can use over Facebook Messenger?
U0GQ4GVPY : It seems like it'd be an interesting platform for something like that
U0GQ4GVPY : I would assume you'd have to create a Facebook profile for your bot :s
U0GQ4GVPY : reference for anyone else interested in doing this kind of thing: <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.5/conversation/>
U04SM6T2H : Someone told me this is currently against the FB terms of use 
U0GQ4GVPY : Oh really?
U0GQ4GVPY : that sucks :s
U04SM6T2H : Do it and let them stop you!
U0GQ4GVPY : Yeah I'm going to give it a try anyway :simple_smile:
U0GQ4GVPY : I guess I'll just contact someone at FB before I publicize it
U055FHACC : whatsapp is very swift and efficient in tracking and banning bots. I'd imagine FB will be as well
U0GQF9LVA : Hey, currently building a pretty advanced github bot - if anyone would like to be a part of testing let me know, currently works best on ruby based projects
U0GQF9LVA : plan is to hook into slack too down the line
U0GQLTU75 : <@U0GQF9LVA>: what's the bot do?
U0GPSB7V1 : <@U0GQF9LVA>: all my stuff is go but i like the idea of a github bot!
U0GQF9LVA : <@U0GQLTU75>:  <@U0GPSB7V1> The ideas is that it will be pluggable with behaviors but we've created six so far that basically do tedious actions for ruby projects... it'll keep an eye on dependencies, security vulnerabilities, database indexes, code style and spelling / grammar
U0GQ4GVPY : Open source?
U0GQF9LVA : Neat thing is it'll either comment on your diffs or (more usually) actually put a pull request in with the fix already made
U0GQF9LVA : behaviors don't have to change code, but that's a workflow we're optimizing for with it being github.
U0GQF9LVA : <@U0GQ4GVPY>: not yet, but that's the plan
U0GQLTU75 : so it'll `rubocop --auto-correct` (or some equivalent) for ya? interesting
U0GQF9LVA : right, similar yep! Interestingly lots of intricacies beyond that as we don't want to action the same piece of code multiple times etc
U0GQ4GVPY : Sounds great
U0GPSB7V1 : sounds great <@U0GQF9LVA>
U0GPSB7V1 : i totally want a bot that merges pull requests after certain emoji are posted in comments and tests have passed :simple_smile:
U0GQ4GVPY : Emoji reactions on GitHub comments/issues/PRs would be awesome
U0GPSB7V1 : like an automated version of the old github-flow from back in the day
U0GQF9LVA : we could definitely write a behavior for that if enough demand :stuck_out_tongue:
U0GPSB7V1 : :thumbsup: :fireworks: :sparkles: are all votes for merge
U0D7C5RAL : :shipit:
U0GPSB7V1 : :thumbsdown: and :shit: mean no
U0GPSB7V1 : lol
U0GQ4GVPY : <@U0GPSB7V1>: can't forget :shipit:
U0GGT8K88 : the rate limit (<https://api.slack.com/docs/rate-limits>) on integrations seems odd. If 100 teams add my slack button to their teams, does that mean in any second, only one of them can be interacting with me?
U0GPSB7V1 : i started work on a primitive RTM slackbot framework written in Go <https://github.com/andrewwatson/goslackbot>
U0GQ4GVPY : <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/general/p1450318413000360>
U0GQ4GVPY : I'd assume that the limit is per token
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0GPSB7V1>: that reminds me we should Open Source our package xD
U04SM6T2H : Awesome
U055FHACC : The future is fun
U0GPSB7V1 : I aliased :8ball: to :meatball: and set up auto responders like "the meatball says: ask again later!"
U0A16QMP0 : hey everyone, just launched the next version of nestor <https://v2.asknestor.me> — works with the Hubot API for now but would love to integrate with botkit. Here's a quick demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuJAFkgWMPw>
U0CNYC404 : <@U0A16QMP0> looking good :simple_smile:
U0GQ4GVPY : Great work <@U0A16QMP0> :sparkles:
U0A16QMP0 : Thanks everyone pretty close to a public beta let me know if u have any questions!
U0GQ4GVPY : I guess the JavaScript being run is sandboxed away from the main app so it can't cause any harm
U0GQ4GVPY : Is there any rate limiting?
U0A16QMP0 : yes the JS is sandboxed
U0A16QMP0 : yup the abuse prevention logic is obviously evolving :simple_smile: but there are ways to make sure that there is no abuse
U0GQ4GVPY : Sounds pretty sweet :+1:
U0AFABJAJ : Congrats to <http://motion.ai|motion.ai>. <https://medium.com/@davidjnelson/motion-ai-has-raised-700k-to-create-the-ui-for-ai-ca56f7a1555c#.nl2yhmf3e>
U0FHTRT7F : cogratulations MotionAI
U0H13RLGJ : anyone have word on when the xoxco SlashWiki will be available?  Looks promising
U04S3JCH2 : <@U0H13RLGJ>: I work on that. our focus has shifted a lot since we made that, but I'm hoping we'll roll that functionality into <http://Howdy.ai|Howdy.ai> sometime next year.
U04T87ZQH : FYI: We released a OAuth scope migration tool, to update your apps/bots <https://twitter.com/SlackAPI/status/677976406215647232>
U0GQ4GVPY : dang you guys never stop working
U0CS6NSF5 : if anybody is using the rtm.start, no need to check it yet :stuck_out_tongue:
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U04T87ZQH>: we're going to be moving to use a bot now that it can be provisioned with oauth
U0CS6NSF5 : if we could migrate the `client` scope to `bot` it would be great. even better if we could add `commands` too :stuck_out_tongue:
U0D7C5RAL : I didn't realize you were here as well, <@U04T87ZQH>. The Metafilter Slacks say hello. :simple_smile:
U04T87ZQH : heh
U04TLHGSC : Note the "heh" not the "hello" back.
U04TLHGSC : I KID I KID
U0GPSB7V1 : seems like i'm having trouble getting my bot to convince slack that it's mpim_aware
U0GPSB7V1 : mpim_aware=true and mpim_aware=1 don't seem to work...
U0H0MPM6U : any opinions on posting bot messages using WEB API versus the RTM API? I've got a bot listening in RTM stream but thinking of replying back with Web API.
U06U57P6E : <@U0H0MPM6U>: If you can reply via the RTM API, it's wasteful to open more connections and what not. It will work though.
U07VCKRUK : <@U0H0MPM6U>: you'll find the web API far more flexible for posting messages vs. RTM.  RTM only handles simple text messages, `chat.postMessage` allows for attachments, linking names, etc.
U0CS6NSF5 : replying via the WEB API is a couple of orders of magnitude slower too
U0GPSB7V1 : if you want your bot to reply with web api then it needs two tokens, right? on for RTM and one for Web?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0GPSB7V1>: nope, the bot token access token also gives you access to certain methods in the API, including chat.postMessage
U0GPSB7V1 : Oh cool, thanks <@U0CS6NSF5> !
U0CS6NSF5 : np :simple_smile:
U0H0Q1X5X : Sanity check: If I create a new Slack app for development (unsubmitted) is there a way to invite other people on my team to see the app in _their_ <https://api.slack.com/applications> page? Multiple devs on same project etc.
U0H0Q1X5X : So they could add slash commands, etc without going through me
U0H240HFE : you may want to check out the “add to slack” button
U0H0Q1X5X : Sorry, should have been clearer. I have 2-3 developers on my team who all need to work on the _development_ of a new slack app.
U0H0Q1X5X : So I'm basically wondering if there's a way to say “These other people can administer this app"
U0H0MPM6U : thanks for feedback. Definitely using the RTM right now but was curious if there were pros and cons <@U07VCKRUK> <@U06U57P6E>
U055FHACC : We summed up our first week on the new platform:<https://medium.com/@mmatty/our-first-week-on-the-slack-platform-8d5a996f6bb6#.x4x63k8pu>

U0H1Y7M1S : <@U055FHACC> this is great insight, thanks for putting this together!!
U0554MQJB : <@U055FHACC> agreed on needing to invite bots to each channel being a problem. For teams with 50-100 channels it's not realistic to ask users to do it this way
U0554MQJB : <@U055FHACC> that's the top thing that feels broken right now, along with inability to create a channel for the bot
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0554MQJB>: just ask for channels:write and use the user's token to create channels and/or invite the bot
U0554MQJB : <@U0CS6NSF5>: that's also a problem since the calling user must be a member of each channel, even if they are public channels. Simplest thing would be if a bot can read or join public channels like any other user.
U0554MQJB : <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.invite>
U055FHACC : <@U0554MQJB>: we actually asked the Slack team to stop forcing bots to auto-join. People were really upset about it, but now we miss that.I understand why Slack would hesitate about allowing bots to create and join channels. This could be very easily abused by developers, so if it's ever allowed, probably should come with a set of usage rules

U04SM6T2H : I am booting the last wave of new Howdy bots before the holidays. If anyone here is still on the waiting list, let me know and I'll bump you!
U0FSRDKHN : <@U04SM6T2H>: I'm on the waiting list!
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0554MQJB>: in our case the user has to be in the channel anyway, so that's OK
U0GS37F2T : Is there any kind of namespacing or unique registration for Slack apps? IE: if you have one slash command defined, can you not install another app that tries to register the same slash command? Thinking of something generic like “slash ask” or something to that effect
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0GS37F2T>: AFAIK, there's no namespacing and the name you set for your slash command is optional. I haven't checked how they handle collisions, though
U0GS37F2T : Thanks, ditto on the collisions - I can try it out, I should probably use something unique enough that has a low chance of collision just in case
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0GS37F2T>: :ok_hand:
U0CS6NSF5 : np :simple_smile:
U0G6S4L48 : if it is anything like bot name collisions, slack just appends a 2 on the second one to show up : )
U07060PG9 : the command that was installed first takes precedence in my experience, but they might change that in the future.
U07060PG9 : meaning if App 1 installed `/test` and App 2 attempts to install `/test`, App 1's remains and App 2's fails to install.
U0G6S4L48 : k
U0G6S4L48 : good to know
U0FSRDKHN : I hope they change that soon. It doesn't seem like a good policy.
U0H7BNR3M : hi all, just curious to see if there are any aussie slackbot developers here
U0H7BNR3M : interesting in starting a group
U0H59J924 : Hi <@U0H7BNR3M>, I'm just starting with it. Like literally yesterday. In Melbourne, you?
U0H7BNR3M : <@U0H59J924>: sydney based
U0H7BNR3M : I work for a major retailer and really looking at developing our tooling into our communications
U0H59J924 : Similar story. Building an integration for an existing app's data / community.  If you don't have any luck finding more local devs , I'd be happy to join an AU slack dev user group.
U0H7BNR3M : <@U0F9T9KPH>: awesome, will definitely keep it in mind
U0H7BNR3M : <@U0F9T9KPH>: I am a big a-league fan so over the break I want to have a go at building one for football/soccer results
U0F9T9KPH : <@U0H7BNR3M>: Wrong Tim :simple_smile:
U0H7BNR3M : separate to the work related piece
U0H7BNR3M : oh sorry <@U0F9T9KPH>
U0F9T9KPH : No worries.
U0H7BNR3M : <@U0H59J924>: please check out the comments I assigned to the wrong tim
U0H59J924 : :+1: PM me if you've got a public repo.
U0H59J924 : ^ <@U0H7BNR3M>
U055FHACC : Enter Google<http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-plans-new-smarter-messaging-app-1450816899?mod=e2fb>

U0CR53UMR : <@U055FHACC>: I own <http://smartermessaging.com|smartermessaging.com> … maybe it's time to put it up for sale :wink:
U0H88ASGK : Hello guys!
U0H8KT3AN : You know you are in too many Slack channels when you run out of unique themes for each one...
U0GPTQ81L : That's an awesome come-in :stuck_out_tongue:
U04SM6T2H : :simple_smile:
U04SM6T2H : Morning everyone :wink:
U0GPTQ81L : Morning? Just finished working :stuck_out_tongue:
U0H8KT3AN : anyone familiar with <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit> ?
U0H8KT3AN : it seems like, with a single channel bot, storage isn't pre-populated when connecting
U0H8KT3AN : but's it's not obvious enough for me to tell if it _should_ and I am missing something or it _shouldn't_ and I need to warm it up with the payload from rtm.start
U0GPTQ81L : I think that we are familiar with BotKit in here :stuck_out_tongue:
U0H8KT3AN : `controller.storage.channels.get(message.channel, (err, result) =&gt; {});` keeps coming back null
U0H8KT3AN : and `controller.storage.channels.all((err, result) =&gt; {});` is empty as well
U0BSHTG0P : need more code
U0H8KT3AN : sorry, I was trying to keep it brief
U0H8KT3AN : ```controller.storage.channels.all((err, result) =&gt; {
  <http://logger.info|logger.info>(result); // this results in an empty line
});
```

U0H8KT3AN : digging through the source, looks like I need to populate the storage or hold onto the rtm.start payload for reference
U0H8KT3AN : looking at the comment, looks like it was a thought but never implemented: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/lib/Slackbot_worker.js#L84>
U04SM6T2H : hey <@U0H8KT3AN>
U04SM6T2H : the storage is empty yes
U04SM6T2H : you would have to build your own caching scheme
U04SM6T2H : and I wouldn't recommend using the storage for caching
U04SM6T2H : since it is persistent
U0H8KT3AN : yeah, I realized that looking at it more
U04SM6T2H : its really more for storing data on behalf of the team
