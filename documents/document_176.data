<@U20TEUNF8> <@U101K6JDD>  i would but seTimeout in a global accesible variable so he can clear that timeout at anytime.

hi
where is bot_id?
<@U39V9TU05> Can you please give us a bit more detail on your question? (you probably don't want the answer: in the code :wink: )
i created a bot.. [custom integration].. .i got token.. but the in the py code, i need 'bot_id'... i used another function to generate env var.. but... failed
i was referring to -&gt; <https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html>
Do you folks have any direction on monitoring a file in Windows for when it gets modified and update in a slack channel?
<@U0L55AWTY> our good ol' NodeJS can you help you there
with its own builtin "fs" library
 How do I get started with that?
simple
you go to <http://nodejs.org|nodejs.org>
and read the API documentation
one sec
here you go
<https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watchfile_filename_options_listener>
i would recommend you use f.watch as its more efficient
OK. 
<https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener>
Not much of any NodeJS experience. Is this something simple to fire up on Windows or do I need to watch a while course on NodeJS on Pluralsight?
how are you using botkit then?
:slightly_smiling_face:
or what are you using for your slack development?
I guess I am here to learn somewhat but not really a dev. More of a sysadmin 
so your question was not development oriented? were you just looking for an app, or ... ?
Yeah more so an app yes. I think to start I will use Curl and a bat script which will send to slackbot for now. 
this is more of a slack development channel :slightly_smiling_face:
OK. Thanks. :-)
no worries
unfortunately i do not know of any apps
It's all good. 
i can tell you that if you want to start creating your own slack bot you can start here: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit>
OK cool. I want to learn NodeJS some times as it keeps coming up on my radar. 
@ Everyone: found this interesting computational literature library: <http://rednoise.org/rita/index.php>
<@U322K0W57>: what is it that you would suggest I learn? Just NodeJS? Learning something completely new will eventually come but it takes a long time because of anxiety and fear. It appears to over whelming for a while at first until I get my feet wet for a while so to speak. 
I can fire up an ubuntu machine. Run applications by following directions and all. 
I was looking at <http://evtechnologies.com/monitoring-windows-freespace-with-slackbot-getting-started/> and was going to rewrite the bat file but code calling the slack URL looks outdated
<@U0L55AWTY> Windows vs Linux should not create you many issues, especially for what you need
OK fair enough. :slightly_smiling_face:
NodeJS has a lot of traction and its very popular, so maybe it is worth looking into
and trying to learn a few thing
NodeJS is different then NPM?
anything you learn, no matter the language or the framework is useful in the end
NPM is node's package ecosystem
OK fair enough. I wish I worked with a team. I work on my own at my $job and with my clients.
Ahh. Like apt-get?
yes :slightly_smiling_face:
where node is your *nix system in this assumption :slightly_smiling_face:
Alright
How do you increase your community inside Slack without having to "invite" them by email? Assuming they're not on the same domain as those already on board. Tks.
Anyway, check it out: <https://inviterobot.com>, and let me know if you have any question!
But you still need to "invite". What if you have been locked out due to sending out invites before realizing there was a. It off?
Cut off

Would love to get feedback on this. <https://www.npmjs.com/package/alexa-botkit> it adds support for alexa in botkit
of course i forgot to change the package description fun...
Hi all, is it mandatory to submit app to work with buttons messages
<@U3236DR4Z> No, you don't need to submit it. Submission is only to be included in the directory.
hello! is it easy to setup a Slack bot to direct message users? I see that chat.postMessage can take in an IM channel but does that mean the IM channel has to exist before the bot can send DMs to users?
Hello everyone!
I shared something on <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> and I need some examples if you can share some. Thanks
Even I read botkit's medium story under “Slack ‘Message Buttons' in Botkit” <@U04SM6T2H> <https://blog.howdy.ai/botkit-interactive-messages-d3a4eaaf1ef0> but it doesn't say how to `implement` to make those buttons clickable :( 
<@U392A23SP> you can just use `im.open` <https://api.slack.com/methods/im.open>
followed by `chat.postMessage`
oh, awesome! thanks!
Mike Melanin, Artyom Keydunov <@U0GRN5Q3G>   and Pavel Tiunov <@U0M9TD3NZ> .
Done! :+1::bicyclist:
done
the other bots are meeehh
I mean, not all
but some
Is this the only “Bot of the Year” list so far published, or are there more out there?
Great question. I personally would rather see a publication that works with a bunch of industry people. I dislike PH as it's all about who you know and silly gifs of cats and emojis.
yes lol. I think it's automated

i'm getting "referenceError: bot is not defined" when i try and use bot.say, any thoughts? I think im missing something easy
Hi <@U0563E81H>, my app is not working with messages buttons. could you help me, what should i do?
hi, i am facing a problem while updating a message with buttons. i want my buttons to be there even if someone clicks on it. i am using python API . on calling chat.update my attachments are getting ignored
anyone happen to know offhand if i need to resubmit my Slack app to the directory if i add/change the interactive messages URL?
All changes now need to be resubmitted
Oh really? Just changing the interactive callback URL needs submission again? Not that I do that every day but I consider it part of my internal code...
i assume that you can still change what happens in the code without resubmitting, but changing the URL itself would require a new submission, since that's done through the <http://Slack.com|Slack.com> interface?
you change the config on <http://slack.com/apps|slack.com/apps>
so I assume you need re-submit
ah well
re-submit is not clear for me
they're pretty quick when you're just updating an app, at least
but changing webhook URL seems an obvious case
in fact they've already approved my update, thanks Slack
:joy_cat:
on that note the Harvard Business Review bot has a new and improved onboarding process for new teams. Users who install the bot for their team can now publicize it simply by hitting a button in their DMs, rather than literally inviting the bot to a public channel. Thanks for the idea <@U0HBN0L9M>! <https://hbr.org/hbr-bot-for-slack>
My next task is using another message button so that other users can subscribe from that public-channel message, instead of having to find HBR in their direct message list and type a subscribe message to it
At MetaCert we have a configuration page that auto detects their channels during the installation process and then prompts them to "Add to all new channels in the future". So that way users don't even need to invite the bot to a channel.
<@U21U8SZ2P> rad!
how does it choose which channel to broadcast into?
it just goes to <#C04SM6TAK|general> or whatever you renamed <#C04SM6TAK|general> to
at some point, gonna rework it so the user picks which channel they want to broadcast to. but we're also talking about allowing people to put the bot's daily updates in a channel too, so i'd probably wanna do those things together
ah cool
good idea
yeah, that's the trick I used with <http://Skillz.io|Skillz.io> and Stop Breathe Think : you don't need to ask your user any input other than "is it ok to post in <#C04SM6TAK|general>?"
you can circle through public channels, there'll be always one and only one with is_general:true
this reduce friction
anything that reduces friction makes onboarding better
but I guess this work mostly for intro/onboarding/discovery only. in most cases, the user won't want to have notifications broadcasted in <#C04SM6TAK|general>. So the next step is usually to give her the option to choose another channel
with my chat bot, is there a way to see who did an @ at it for my response?
user returns the user id it looks like
