I understand I can now do without the `FetchFail` Msg but I'm not sure how
<@U3LUC6SNS> `|= keep oneOrMore \x -&gt; x != '}'` should work
if I want to handle errors in my `processFetch` function I would have to have access to `model` in the function
<@U1X5ZRJUX> Look at the type definition for Http.send, `send : (Result Error a -&gt; msg) -&gt; Request a -&gt; Cmd msg`
`(Result Error a -&gt; msg)` can be any function that produces any `Msg`
the simplest way to do that is `type Msg = FeedResponse (Result Error String)`
and just pass `FeedResponse` to http.send
Do you see what I am doing wrong?
is there a way to build the HTML doc for the modules that my project imports - and say have them somewhere inside `./elm-stuff` --- I'm going to be offline for a vacation, and want the library docs at hand
Thanks! <@U153UK3FA>  I'll give that a think
in general, I'm wondering where documentation on how to use elm-make and elm-project live... the web site doesn't really point to anything
<@U3LUC6SNS> the ‘\' character in strings is used to escape the characters after it, eg "\"" is the way to make a string that has a `"` character, you'll need to do "\\begin{foo}blah, blah\\end{foo}"
<@U153UK3FA> Thanks - got it!  Works now.
oh god, you're not trying to parse latex are you?
