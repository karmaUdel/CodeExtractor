U5Z3Y472L : I'm trying to implement a login form. My view code looks like this :
U5Z3Y472L : view : Model -&gt; Html Msgview model =
     form [ class "w70 center", onSubmit Login ]
          [ label [ for "email", class "row mts" ] [ text "Adresse email"]
          , input [ name "email", type_ "email", class "row", onInput ChangeEmail ][]
          , label [ for "password", class "row mts" ] [ text "Mot de passe"]
          , input [ name "password", class "mbs w70", type_ model.passwordFieldType, onInput ChangePassword, value "" ]
                  [ div
                      [ class "passwordShow" ]
                      [ input
                          [ checked model.isPasswordVisible, type_ "checkbox", onClick TogglePasswordVisibility ]
                          [ text "Afficher"]
                      , a [ onClick Login, class "row btn primary-btn" ]
                          [ div [ class "grid-3-1" ]
                                [ div [ class "txtcenter" ] [ text "Me connecter"]
                                , viewSpinner model.isWaitingConnect
                                ]
                          ]
                      , div [ class "w50 center" ]
                          [ a [ href "#", onClick SendResetLink ] [ text "J'ai oublié mon mot de passe"]
                          , viewSpinner model.isWaitingReset
                          ]
                      ]
                  ]
          ]

viewSpinner : Bool -&gt; Html Msg
viewSpinner isWaiting =
    if isWaiting then
        div []
            [ i [ class "fa fa-spinner fa-pulse fa-lg" ] []
            ]
    else
        div [][]

U5Z3Y472L : The compiler doesn't like it:
U5Z3Y472L : The 1st and 2nd entries in this list are different types of values.
56|                           [ a [ href "#", onClick SendResetLink ] [ text "J'ai oublié mon mot de passe"]
57|&gt;                          , viewSpinner model.isWaitingReset
58|                           ]

The 1st entry has this type:

    Html (String -&gt; Msg)

But the 2nd is:

    Html (Msg)

U5Z3Y472L : I don't understand how to fix this
U3SJEDR96 : What's the type of `SendResetLink`?
U5Z3Y472L : type Msg    = Login
    | ChangeEmail String
    | ChangePassword String
    | SendResetLink
    | TogglePasswordVisibility Bool

U3SJEDR96 : Hm, it seems to think you have `SendResetLink String`
U5Z3Y472L : Yep. The question is: why?
U5Z3Y472L : When I remove the href attribute from the link, the error message becomes:
U5Z3Y472L : ```Html (Bool -&gt; Msg)

But the 2nd is:

    Html (Msg)
```

U3SJEDR96 : Oh, wait, it's a different place entirely - `onClick TogglePasswordVisibility` where `TogglePasswordVisibility : Bool -&gt; Msg`
U3SJEDR96 : you may want `onClick &lt;| TogglePasswordVisiblity &lt;| not model.isPasswordVisible`
U3SJEDR96 : or you can just get rid of the boolean parameter and flip it in your model
U3SJEDR96 : (I'd also try to derive `isPasswordVisible` from your `passwordFieldType` rather than keeping it as two separate pieces of state)
U5Z3Y472L : Great! Thanks for your help <@U3SJEDR96>!
U3SJEDR96 : or the other way around. Point being you have two ways to describe the same data currently; and if they get out of sync, you'll have some pretty odd behaviour
U5Z3Y472L : you're right
U3SJEDR96 : Glad we figured it out, tho - good luck!
U5GJ5FEAU : after watching <@U13H7FNDQ> elm-europe talk, my app has reduced by ~25 files. Realized each page of a spa doesn't need to have its own update + view + rest file .. just in case someone else is also doing the same thing, you'll save yourself writing a lot of imports for sure :smile:
U5J08KX0D : Hi folks. What's the best way to play sounds? The Howler js library is fantastic (does cross browser really well) - if there's no agreed-upon Elm solution, ought I learn about ports?  - thanks again!

U3SJEDR96 : Ports are probably best, yeah
U62KVQVD1 : Any idea why can I be getting following error: "Cannot find variable `=&gt;`" ?
U62KVQVD1 : Is this something what was deprecated? Operator =&gt; ?
U62KVQVD1 : <https://gist.github.com/korczis/ed88388c2188fd39550d1b0a49a36448>
U5A726ZAR : <@U5GJ5FEAU> which video is that? I cant find it in the Elm Europe 2017 playlist
U3SJEDR96 : <@U62KVQVD1> it's not defined in `core`. It's defined in a util module in `elm-spa-example`though. Basically', it's this:```
(=&gt;) : a -&gt; b -&gt; (a, b)
(=&gt;) = (,)
infixl 0 =&gt;
```

U62KVQVD1 : <@U3SJEDR96> I see, thanks
U62KVQVD1 : Writing SPA in elm is quite hard :disappointed: Any ideas when elm 0.19 will get released?
U41NK9BM4 : BTW, `=&gt;` operator will be available in 0.19 by default
U3SQ42JJW : Hi everyone. I am just sitting here and think if my code is as pure functional as it should be.For Example I have a function 
```
getUsers : Model -&gt; List User
getUsers model = 
    model.users
```
Later in the code I use the following function:
```
getAllUserNames: Model -&gt; List String
getAllUserNames model = 
    List.map (...) (getUsers model)
```

U3SQ42JJW : This is not pure and should be avoided, I would say… or?
U41NK9BM4 : Why do you think isn't pure ?
U3SQ42JJW : right way would be ```
getAllUsers : List User -&gt; List String 
```

U62KVQVD1 : <@U41NK9BM4> I am afraid if I will be able to migrate my code to 0.19
U3SJEDR96 : getUsers doesn't work, though
