U63MMCP2P : What protocol would you use?
U656PFHFB : <@U5NMSURAQ> this is what I was looking for this should keep me occupied. Thanks 

U2ER5QXJR : I am setting up a new machine for dev. I was about to go fix my "no such file or directory: /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh" error, but paused to think about whether I should still be using virtualenvwrapper. I'm doing Python 2.7 and 3.5 dev. Is there anything better these days? How should I be managing my environments as a "modern" Python developer?
U5NMSURAQ : <@U2ER5QXJR> I'd recommend pyenv
U5NMSURAQ : you can install and use pypy, py27, py34, py35 and py36 all at the same time
U5NMSURAQ : need a virtualenv? `pyenv virtualenv 3.5.2 myproject-3.5.2`
U2ER5QXJR : Thanks <@U5NMSURAQ>. I'll check it out
U4TB19ASU : Hi there, i need to find a package or a solution for log http call and retry failed call with an GUI or website. Anyone got some got lib or package ?
U2ER5QXJR : <@U4TB19ASU> Can the requests library do what you want? There are some retry examples in <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15431044/can-i-set-max-retries-for-requests-request>
U4TB19ASU : Yes it's good start but i want to log failed call (with http code error) for edit post params in a gui or web app and resend request.
U653RFLBD : maybe `logging` will do what you want?something like:
```
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```
Then under your requests `response` object do something like

```
logger.debug('http status: {}'.format(response.status))
```

U42LCHFD2 : <@U1BP42MRS> Do you know why sometimes they dont get credited even though they were sent? not a big deal just curious - there were a couple that I "received" but last I checked they never got tallied
U1BP42MRS : <@U42LCHFD2> it only works in public channels, if they don't send you may need to `/invite <@U1PS72N20>`
U42LCHFD2 : cool thanks
U3XNUHACT : Getting this annoying error — requirements are satisfied, chromedriver in the right place, this error comes upon launching a chrome window
U5LNXQHN3 : it implies there's a problem with the server, but it could also just be that the package doesn't handle that situation properly. It's unlikely to be your fault
U3XNUHACT : <@U5LNXQHN3> how can I fix it?
U5LNXQHN3 : That depends on what you mean by fix. If the server is broken and you don't control the server, it's unfixable. If the package just doesn't understand something the server is doing, it's probably possible to patch the package, but that would probably be a job for the package maintainer
U0LSCQQNR : the reason being is `str(None)` results in `'None'`, which is a string
U0LSCQQNR : open up a python shell
U0LSCQQNR : enter in `str(None)`
U0LSCQQNR : ```In [1]: str(None)Out[1]: 'None'```

U662G8BNY : anyone know how to get ids from transmission using their api?
U662G8BNY : <http://transmissionrpc.readthedocs.io/en/release-0.7/reference/transmissionrpc.html#transmissionrpc.Client.get_files>
U560XSDT3 : <@U0LSCQQNR> Thanks for reply! Yeah, but there is function which does not filter it:
U5VGKQ2SY : <@U560XSDT3> instead of screenshots, pleas copy and paste the code. You can paste code w/ "+" button to left of message area.
U0LSCQQNR : or use code formatting
U0LSCQQNR : <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks>
U0LSCQQNR : so the reason why that function is not working is because you're using `and` for everything
U0LSCQQNR : there's no way a variable can be `''` and `' '` at the same time
U0LSCQQNR : so, for you, the best thing would be to break it out into an if-else conditional test
