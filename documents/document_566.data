As I transition to Elm from Perl, I'm finding my JSON encoding is wacked.  From my existing Perl JSON API, what should be Ints have `""`s around them, so they look like strings.  Is there a way to decode them with a `String.toInt` kind of thing so I can match the JSON to my (proper) objects?
Yes but you'll have to worry about `Result` because the string might not be a valid integer
