U37HUSJ4R : I can’t use `keyValuePairs`
U37HUSJ4R : any ideas
U23SA861Y : why can't you use keyValue Pairs?
U37HUSJ4R : because `keyValuePairs` wants the pairs to be same type (this could be wrong?)
U23SA861Y : the pairs are the same type (String, List Int)
U23SA861Y : or at least that's what you have written
U23SA861Y : you then need to appropriately decode the date and times
U0LPMPL2U : If you said `keyValuePairs timeDecoder` you would have a `Decoder (List (String, Time))`
U0LPMPL2U : assuming you've already created a `timeDecoder`
U0LPMPL2U : that can be turned into a `Decoder (List Date)` with something like `map (uncurry Date)`
U37HUSJ4R : I have a timeDecoder, ```
timeDecoder : Decoder Time
timeDecoder = 
    Decode.map2 Time
        (Decode.index 0 <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
        (Decode.index 1 <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
```

U0LPMPL2U : ```datesDecoder : Decoder (List Date)
datesDecoder =
  Decode.keyValuePairs (Decode.maybe timeDecoder)
    |&gt; Decode.map (uncurry Date)
```

U0LPMPL2U : I think this should work
U0LPMPL2U : this can then be turned into a `Decoder Custom` using `Decode.map`
U0LPMPL2U : ```customDecoder : Decoder Custom
customDecoder =
  Decode.map Custom datesDecoder
```

U37HUSJ4R : ```module Main exposing (..)

import Html exposing (Html, text)
import Json.Decode as Decode exposing (keyValuePairs, string, Decoder)


main : Html a
main =
    text &lt;| toString &lt;| Decode.decodeString customDecoder input

customDecoder : Decoder Custom
customDecoder =
  Decode.map Custom datesDecoder

datesDecoder : Decoder (List Date)
datesDecoder =
  Decode.keyValuePairs (Decode.maybe timeDecoder)
    |&gt; Decode.map (uncurry Date)

timeDecoder : Decoder Time
timeDecoder = 
    Decode.map2 Time
        (Decode.index 0 <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)
        (Decode.index 1 <http://Decode.int|Decode.int>)


type alias Custom = {
    data: List Date
}

type alias Date =
    { date : String, extra : Maybe Time }


type alias Time = { start: Int, end: Int} 

input : String
input =
    """
{"custom":{"20170414":[900, 1300],"20170415":[],"20170417":[],"20170429":[],"20170501":[],"20170527":[],"20170529":[],"20170828":[],"20171225":[],"20171226":[]}}
"""
```

U37HUSJ4R : ```The right side of (|&gt;) is causing a type mismatch.
(|&gt;) is expecting the right side to be a:

Decoder (List ( String, Maybe Time )) -&gt; a

But the right side is:

Decoder ( String, Maybe Time ) -&gt; Decoder Date
```

U37HUSJ4R : can’t save it in ellie with errors :disappointed:
U0LPMPL2U : oh, I forgot a `List.map` in there somewhere
U0LPMPL2U : We've got a `Decoder (List (String, Maybe Time))` so to do stuff with that tuple we need to map both the decoder and the list
U23SA861Y : wait, you can't save on ellie with errors :confounded:
