Yes, you're right 100%
but
effectively foo and bar are the same here
tkinter callbacks don't accept arguments, they are all callables compatible with `lambda: x`
but you almost always need to pass something that takes a whole lot of arguments
This talk wasn't directly about tkinter
therefore it's a common pattern to hide the stuff that you actually need to do behind a simple unassuming lambda
that was the general context, but not to my comment about `lambda: foo()` and `foo` being the same
alright I got it. Now I need a progress bar.
alright then :slightly_smiling_face:
we're both wrong and right in 50% of contexts :slightly_smiling_face:
solve one problem, another pops up
tkinter.ttk has a progressbar widget
:stuck_out_tongue:
I was being too literal, my apologies (sorry, had to run into a quick meeting)
^^ Could anyone explain what I'm doing wrong to get the error there?
i have a feeling it's just a weird typo that i'm not seeing
I'm noticing an immediate syntax error
can you even use comments in a dict?
`replication ,` can't happen
you mean `replication, `?  or am i missing where there's a space?
shouldn't it be `replication:`
oooooh yes
yeah, in your second dict in the list
thank you for the eyeballs :smile:
should be `'replication': { ...}`
^^
facepalm :stuck_out_tongue:
you have it in two locations
both `replication` keys
fixed!
:boom:
duhhhhhhhh
sometimes its the little things
and things like this is where using an editor or IDE helps
because it can check your code for syntax validity as you write it
not so much with the shell or ipython
<@U0LSCQQNR> actually i use vim with syntax highlighting and it runs flake8 on everything when saving, and somehow it just decided i must be trying to do some other valid thing in python
at least my test suite figured out it was a problem :stuck_out_tongue:
oh, interesting
:slightly_smiling_face:
test suites FTW
so flake8 said that was valid python?
interesting
yeah idunno what it thought i was looking for
you may want to write a bug report about that on their gitlab
include that dict structure as an example
that's not a bad idea
worst case there really is some half valid reason for syntax like that and they close it
yup
don't see anything on the tracker about dictionaries that applies
so, maybe an edge case?

Finally finished this stupid gui. It should work
omg it works
:awwyea:
Hey everyone. I need some help with django, particualrly behave-django. I have some tests, some of which are dependent on there being some entries in a specific table. I thought Django would run migrations when it sets up the test database and created one but to no avail. I'd like to know if there's a way to add those table entries after the test database has been created. I'm using DRF.
You may want to ask in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> <@U53MQAY3A> instead of here
Cool, thanks.
Anyone update PyCharm in the last couple of days and have your colors change?
I don't think function names were colored before.
Mine have been for as long as I can recall - but maybe it accidentally overrode your config
It looks like many of the colors changed a bit. I don't remember what color functions were, maybe they were highlighted, but it is different. The TODO: colors also look a little different.
has anyone used the attribute "placeholder" when using pyramid and deform?
I need to add a placeholder to a field but Im not actually coding an html page. so this would need to be done while constructing the schema of the table fields
<@U2BS4M1RV> yeah my colors got changed too
<@U29163YQH> Are they easy to change back? I think I liked the old ones better.
Yeah color are easy to edit. But you need to figure out what they where before. I launched the previous version and compared some
Oh I guess I am on the EAP, I guess mine have been _different_ for a while :facepalm:
Mine were changed with 2017.2
I tried the IntelliJ theme, I can't stand it, it's too bright and the colors don't stand out much.
I use darcula with small modification 
Yeah, that's what I use. Only issue I have with the prior to this week colors is that I want multi-line TODOs.
That's more of how it parses those than the color though.
multiline todos would be nice - have you had that working before?
I haven't.
Just something I would like to see.
Aww, I thought you were about to make my week!
It would be something worth requesting, I would think.
Maybe I'll offer to pay for a year if they add it.
Appreciate any help to point me to the right direction, not familiar with os class, how the files look like is in the comment :pray:
Maybe?
yeah.. this works for me if I have zip file that extracts to csv if csv not there. But print "csv-filename already exists" if csv w/ same same already exists.
Thanks! This is what I have so far, not working as I thought it would be, instead of file_a_1, file_a_2, file_b_1, file_b_2. It gives file_a_1, file_a_2, file_b_3, file_b_4
