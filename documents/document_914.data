U4BMZ90T0 : I just pass the controller in, grab the dictionary of frames and get the variable from the corresponding frame
U4BMZ90T0 : But this is quite annoying :slightly_smiling_face:
U1BP42MRS : That was my experience with most desktop ui programming, it's a little funky what you have to do
U5NMSURAQ : especially since Tk is sooo barebones
U4BMZ90T0 : I just need 4 screens
U4BMZ90T0 : that's it
U5NMSURAQ : there's a good side though: you better understand what happens under the wraps in other GUI frameworks
U4BMZ90T0 : god is this bad
U4BMZ90T0 : Should have just made a frontend, honestly
U4BMZ90T0 : just attempting to format this is so bad.
U1BP42MRS : That's a bit rude, but I challenge you to show me how this case above is not the same, vs just saying it's not. Here is proof it is:
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
...    print("foo")
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar = lambda: print("bar")
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
foo
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar()
bar
```

You can pass around `bar` or `foo` to any function that needs a callable (with no args in this case)

U1BP42MRS : ```&gt;&gt;&gt; type(foo)
&lt;class 'function'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(bar)
&lt;class 'function'&gt;
```

U5NMSURAQ : something like this, in a 2x2 grid?
U5NMSURAQ : rude? man, I specifically joked about a cup-of-coffee so that doesn't seem rude :disappointed:
U1BP42MRS : &gt; nooo waaay
U4BMZ90T0 : I legitimately just have two frames of a 2 labels, a dropdown and a button
U1BP42MRS : Is what I was referring to
U4BMZ90T0 : and I can't get them to do anything lol
U4BMZ90T0 : Format wise
U5NMSURAQ : &gt; You can pass around `bar` or `foo` to any function that needs a callable (with no args in this case)
U1BP42MRS : this is actually what I should have showed
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
...     print("foo")
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar = lambda: foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
foo
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar()
foo
```
