```
it’s expecting a `Request a` which is the same as your `Result Error a`
your `ServerResult : Result Error Msg` …. actually i’m confused
you and me both
what’s your ServerResult sig?
`ServerResult (Result Http.Error Msg)`
honestly I don't even know if that's what it's supposed to be?
first time trying to do any kind of HTTP request and it's properly rustling my jimmies
crap, gtg… soz will help later if anyone else hasn’t jumped in
<@U5YDC1YUW> Should be `ServerResult (Result Http.Error String)`
Compiler assumes first type is correct(`ServerResult (Result Error Msg)`), so it complains when you give it a `Request String`, even though `Request String` is actually what you want.
hmmm true that, found the error really cryptic
`Error extracting <https://dl.bintray.com/elmlang/elm-test/0.18.6/linux-x64.tar.gz> - Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '/usr/lib/node_modules/elm-test/bin/elm-interface-to-json'`
Anyone has seen/resolved this? Looking at the dir mentioned I see it doesn't exist. Also looking at  `elm-test --help` output suggests that it has been installed
Additional info: I had to run `npm install -g elm-test` using `sudo` (otherwise I was getting errors). Another observation: It seems to work when I run the tests using `sudo elm-test` but this doesn't seem desirable
<@U1FCZNA7R> I used to do `npm i -g --prefix ~/.node_modules elm-test` along w/ `PATH="~/.node_modules/bin:$PATH"`, but now I either use NVM or if I have a `package.json` I do `npm i -S elm-test` &amp; add a `"test": "elm-test"`script to `package.json`.
