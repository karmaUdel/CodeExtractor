U153UK3FA : `(Result Error a -&gt; msg)` can be any function that produces any `Msg`
U153UK3FA : the simplest way to do that is `type Msg = FeedResponse (Result Error String)`
U153UK3FA : and just pass `FeedResponse` to http.send
U3LUC6SNS : <@U153UK3FA>, I think I am almost there.   I have this now:```
type alias Environment =
    { env : String
    , body : String
    }


environment : Parser Environment
environment =
    succeed Environment
        |. symbol "\\"
        |. (keyword "begin")
        |. symbol "{"
        |= keep zeroOrMore (\c -&gt; c /= '}')
        |. symbol "}"
        |= keep zeroOrMore (\c -&gt; c /= '\\')
        |. symbol "\\"
        |. (keyword "end")
        |. symbol "{"
        |. keep zeroOrMore (\c -&gt; c /= '}')
        |. symbol "}"
```
and I run
```
run XP.environment "\begin{foo}blah, blah\end{foo}"
```
but get the error 
```
-- SYNTAX PROBLEM -------------------------------------------- repl-temp-000.elm

(line 1, column 24): unexpected "e" expecting space, "&amp;" or escape code

4|   run XP.environment "\begin{foo}blah, blah\end{foo}"
```
Do you see what I am doing wrong?

U601ELFEG : is there a way to build the HTML doc for the modules that my project imports - and say have them somewhere inside `./elm-stuff` --- I'm going to be offline for a vacation, and want the library docs at hand
U1X5ZRJUX : Thanks! <@U153UK3FA>  I'll give that a think
U601ELFEG : in general, I'm wondering where documentation on how to use elm-make and elm-project live... the web site doesn't really point to anything
U153UK3FA : <@U3LUC6SNS> the ‘\' character in strings is used to escape the characters after it, eg "\"" is the way to make a string that has a `"` character, you'll need to do "\\begin{foo}blah, blah\\end{foo}"
U3LUC6SNS : <@U153UK3FA> Thanks - got it!  Works now.
U23SA861Y : oh god, you're not trying to parse latex are you?
U1X5ZRJUX : Stupid question now, just for the sake of trying, I have the following update function```
type Msg
    = FeedResponse (Result Http.Error Model)


update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
    case msg of
        FeedResponse result -&gt;
            processFetch(result)


processFetch : Model -&gt; Result Http.Error Model -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg )
processFetch model result =
    case result of
        Ok bookmarks -&gt;
            ( bookmarks, Cmd.none )

        Err error -&gt;
            ( model, Cmd.none )

```

U1X5ZRJUX : the compiler doesn't like the `processFetch(result)`
U1X5ZRJUX : ```The type annotation for `update` says it always returns:

    ( Model, Cmd Msg )

But the returned value (shown above) is a:

    Result Http.Error Model -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg )
```

U23SA861Y : well it should be `processFetch model result`
U4JT89FGB : what is the rest of the error message? i think the hint should say it may be missing a parameter
U1X5ZRJUX : meh stupid me
U4JT89FGB : i try to outsmart the compiler error messages all the time and every time end up facepalming
U23SA861Y : no brackets for function application
U1X5ZRJUX : and yes the error message was telling me exactly this
U1X5ZRJUX : <@U4JT89FGB> :facepalm:
U4JT89FGB : :smile:
U1X5ZRJUX : thanks guys
