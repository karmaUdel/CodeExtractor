<@U23SA861Y> Random.initialSeed needed to be an Int and so I used the round function. Was looking for something like Time.toInt, but just me being stupid ;D
right, if you weren't using the actual time value then thats ok.
so you went with array of array huh?
y
I am trying to construct a Result object with an error and Result.Result tells me that Result does not expose Result (Result by itself tells me that Result is not a variable)  How do you create a Result?
well, because this putY if you used a dict would just be `Dict.insert (x,y) value grid`
It seems a bit much, any other idea?
<@U23SA861Y> I'm translating from an existing js app so the array map (pun intended) pretty directly I'll look at the Dict implementation as well I'm just trying to get some chops so not much to lose trying a couple ways
if they are arrays you should be able to index directly
setting a single value via a map is a bit clunky
ha tru
