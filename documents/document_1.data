not proposing for this to be part of Clojure, just asking what you think of it as a practice
<@U0LJU20SJ> can you file an issue or PR on that repo?
I guess so. I just thought it would be faster if any of them was here :smile:
I'm here, just focused on other things ATM :)
ah ok, well … done
the fix is quite simple so no op :wink:
<@U0LJU20SJ> thanks!
<@U06SGCEHJ> I just created another pr for some other small markdown problems that I found. Hope it helps
thanks! I'll let <@U07BWACEA> review those changes, he's the primary on the GSoC stuff
