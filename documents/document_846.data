U1BP42MRS : Yeah, mac is popular enough I can focus on it. Then I can learn windows :stuck_out_tongue:
U1BP42MRS : I'll try to do it over the weekend and it'll be free
U3JGK19NV : Thanks!!
U0NRYQNAZ : windows you just install python from the msi.
U0NRYQNAZ : and make sure you check the box to add python to the path.
U3JGK19NV : Yah i'm trying to install virtualenvwrapper
U3JGK19NV : but am getting that
U3JGK19NV : my virtualenvwrapper seems to be here `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`
U0NRYQNAZ : your going to want to add some lines to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file.
U3JGK19NV : it's different if i'm using zsh, correct?
U0NRYQNAZ : ```export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.environments
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```

U0NRYQNAZ : something like that
U0NRYQNAZ : yea you put it in your zshconfig however you have that setup.
U0NRYQNAZ : i load my zsh config via my own script that i call at the end of the config zsh uses.
U0NRYQNAZ : `WORKON_HOME` is the dir where all your virtualenvs are installed when you write the `mkvirutualenv` command
U1NSCAY6R : Just the last line should be sufficient 
U0NRYQNAZ : i trimmed it down to those two.
U1NSCAY6R : Sorry spotty internet the rest of it popped through haha
U1BP42MRS : yeah, `~/.zshrc`
U3JGK19NV : Done!
U3JGK19NV : got it
U1BP42MRS : :thumbsup::skin-tone-4:
U3JGK19NV : so now no need to run this?
U1NSCAY6R : I wish more shells had bash compatibility layers like `fish` does 
U0NRYQNAZ : the last two lines you paste into your shell config
U3JGK19NV : yup
U0NRYQNAZ : you could run them yourself from the command line but that isn't too efficient to do every time you open a terminal.
U3JGK19NV : ahh ok
U3JGK19NV : thanks!
U0NRYQNAZ : if you ever use pyenv you will need to do something similar.
U3JGK19NV : It's bad practice to use folders with spaces when making the virtual environment, right?
U0NRYQNAZ : on a mac you can install that with brew. it makes everything super easy.
U0NRYQNAZ : dang, want to see how things get dated over time? this is a super simple ansible playbook for installing virtualenvwrapper from a yr ago. <https://gist.github.com/mikefromit/4281f29013fe3b4306a87cb64a2ad1fd>
U3JGK19NV : virtual environments are extremely cool, but they definitely have a learning curve to them
U0NRYQNAZ : lots of things have changed in ansible now.
U0NRYQNAZ : yea, i was a bit confused by them when i first started.
U0NRYQNAZ : i was thankful for those few tutorials i found that really went through creating those.
U3JGK19NV : why would i want the virtual environment in the standard environment folder and not in my project folder?
U0NRYQNAZ : i remember on my first projects i pushed to github i had committed my virtualenv.
U0NRYQNAZ : lol
U0NRYQNAZ : when you need to manage python versions.
U3JGK19NV : haha ouch
U3JGK19NV : my first push had my twitter app tokens!
U0NRYQNAZ : yea that was bad. i've never done that but i've done some google hacks to look at when ppl did that.
U3JGK19NV : Haha yah, luckily it was just a monitor i was setting up.
U0NRYQNAZ : i ran a python script to use a custom google search with a googlehack string and then i had splunk index all the results. since the api only allowed a certain amount of calls for free I ran a cron daily.
U0NRYQNAZ : i did my due diligence and contacted ppl.
U1NSCAY6R : Yeah the main problem with vanilla virtualenv is you end up with folders all over the place and management is a mess
U1NSCAY6R : Is pyenv still used a lot?
U1BP42MRS : If I don't use virtualenvwrapper I use pipenv or just docker (but local dev with docker on python isn't the best since you still need a local install for code completion
U1NSCAY6R : Hmm I get code completion in webstorm doing local docker dev. I mount the volume where the code is
U1BP42MRS : Node uses `node_modules` which is a sibling of the project, python uses `site-packages` which isn't - so my guess is that may be why
U1NSCAY6R : Yeah was just realizing that
U1NSCAY6R : Unless you do a virtualenv in the root of the project?
U3JGK19NV : Node is fun but callbacks are a headache haha
U1BP42MRS : Yeah, maybe that works - but then why bother with developing in docker?
U1BP42MRS : callbacks are getting less and less common <@U3JGK19NV> , at least! :slightly_smiling_face:
U1NSCAY6R : Current LTS of node has promises by default 
U1NSCAY6R : I'd call callbacks dead :)
U3JGK19NV : I've heard! they're very confusing at first
U1NSCAY6R : Next LTS has `async/await`
U61LT460H : I m new to python community and has not worked much
U61LT460H : Can someone suggest me some tutorials to help me start with data mining ?
U61LT460H : And also clustering
U5VCDE5SS : anybody know how to intercept a form submission event? I can't seem to figure out how to target the submit event or bind a click event to the form submission button
U5ZPMJA06 : <@U5VCDE5SS> something like <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5384712/capture-a-form-submit-in-javascript> ?
U5RJNFFGX : Hey guys what are the best books to read regarding Python for fundamentals. I know for Django its two scoops
U5ZPMJA06 : <@U5RJNFFGX> Do you already know how to program?
U5RJNFFGX : Yeah. Looking for something more design focused and best practices
U5RJNFFGX : Currently reading idiomatic python
U5RJNFFGX : But that's more of like a skim
U5ZPMJA06 : Ah ok. I came from C++ a long time ago, and I found the standard Python tutorial quite a good read. And I found some 'Python for C++ programmers' online texts.
U5RJNFFGX : Not a big cpp fan haha
U5ZPMJA06 : I had no choice.
U1BP42MRS : Effective Python is good
U2UP91YLE : <@U5RJNFFGX> <http://www.allitebooks.com/fluent-python/>
U5RJNFFGX : Will take a look at both of those books :)) hopefully I can find a free download. The fluent python one is an early release
U5RJNFFGX : Meh I think the early release will be fine
U5RJNFFGX : Thank you very much <@U2UP91YLE> !
U5VCDE5SS : <@U5ZPMJA06> thanks for the link! do you know if it's significantly different than if I use jquery to do this? I had trouble with targeting the correct element 
U1ENC5QCQ : hola oclay que bola
U1ENC5QCQ : que pasa
U1ENC5QCQ : tambien eres programando del python
U5XS8U2QN : Hi, I need a suggestion. I am planning to start a new project for logging user analytics using MongoDB. Which framework will be better to use with Mongo - Flask or Django?

U0NRYQNAZ : flask
U0NRYQNAZ : at one point in time around django 1.4 mongo was great with django but then ppl stopped maintaining some core libraries.
U1BP42MRS : +1 for that use case
U1BP42MRS : Though if you are doing user analytics, you may need something lower latency since that may be a ton of events
U0NRYQNAZ : i built my recent highlighter with elastic search. it worked really well. I would imagine throwing kibana on there could make for a neat analytics platform.
U0NRYQNAZ : <https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>
U5XS8U2QN : <@U0NRYQNAZ> Can you tell me more about it?
U0NRYQNAZ : i've built an elk stack for logging at my old place of employment. it depends on what you mean by analytics :wink:.
U0NRYQNAZ : you could analyze the data with scripts and use things like stochastic gradient descent and things like that or you can build dashboards.
U0NRYQNAZ : not sure how you're trying to check out these events.
U0NRYQNAZ : we used the logs to determine if there were issues in the network.
U5XS8U2QN : I will log request, pageviews and other user actions.
U0NRYQNAZ : do you have any experience with flask?
U0NRYQNAZ : or python web frameworks?
U0NRYQNAZ : i try not to assume things.
U5XS8U2QN : Yes I've decent experience on django
U0NRYQNAZ : k
U0NRYQNAZ : just a sec let me bust out a code sample.
U5XS8U2QN : I can learn flask fast
U5XS8U2QN : pycharm is slow :stuck_out_tongue:
U0NRYQNAZ : i also had to get my kid off of the table.
U5XS8U2QN : okay
U0NRYQNAZ : for user analytics you could use django or flask. to get the user events you'll need some sort of middleware. i'm not talking about that part. what i'm showing is how to get data into elastic search.
U0NRYQNAZ : once you have data in elastic search then the kibana parts comes into play but you will also need to figure that part out.
U5XS8U2QN : ok
U5XS8U2QN : Waiting :slightly_smiling_face:
U0NRYQNAZ : ya, wondering if i should make a big gist. there are several things involved.
U5XS8U2QN : ok take your time :slightly_smiling_face:
U0NRYQNAZ : dang i need to edit this in a bigger window. lol
U0NRYQNAZ : either way, in flask you'll need to do something like that and establish a connection with elastic search.
U0NRYQNAZ : when your app starts up.
U0NRYQNAZ : there may be a flask-extension for it already
U0NRYQNAZ : where you can simply add in the right settings.
U5XS8U2QN : ok then
U0NRYQNAZ : i've updated it with the model. you need to create a model to describe how your document is structured.
U0NRYQNAZ : oh cool. yea you can use this :smiley: <https://github.com/chiangf/Flask-Elasticsearch>
U5XS8U2QN : You used Flask + ES + Kibana?
U0NRYQNAZ : no kibana
U0NRYQNAZ : in my project recently.
U0NRYQNAZ : my past project with ES and Kibana didn't have flask
U5XS8U2QN : How did you build dashboard?
U0NRYQNAZ : i built the dashboard with kibana.
U0NRYQNAZ : flask is only involved in this process b/c it's generating the event.
U0NRYQNAZ : i'm just showing how to save data to elastic search in python with a flask view. once you have data in EL then you can use Kibana to do analytics. Kibana could be installed on a totally different server.
U0NRYQNAZ : hmm.. i could probably PR this elastic search model code i have with this flask extension.
U0NRYQNAZ : it's nice mapping a document to a class.
U5XS8U2QN : Yeah, that will be nice.
U0NRYQNAZ : i know it's a lot of pieces there and gaps but you get started down the path you will get each working :wink:.
U5XS8U2QN : i've few questions.
U0NRYQNAZ : k
U5XS8U2QN : Can you tell me about the architecture part, or process flow.
U5XS8U2QN : Is it something like this - 1. User creates an event.
2. Flask view logs data in ES.
3. Kibana gets data from ES and shows it in dashboard.

U5XS8U2QN : Aren't you using any async tasks queues like rabbitmq or kafka?
U0NRYQNAZ : you could but in the most basic sense you would use the middleware to do a post on elastic search with the data about the event.
U5XS8U2QN : I found this blog post for similar usecase - <http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/|engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/>They used kafka + rabittmq + mongodb + S3 + redshift to build complete architecture

U5XS8U2QN : ES will be better than this?
U0NRYQNAZ : oh idk about that. i haven't used all those before. what i proposed was for something simpler but it could grow to using those things once you need “web scale”. hence, the “logging millions of requests everyday”.
U5XS8U2QN : okay, thanks :slightly_smiling_face: Now I should connect the dots using the code you provided.
U5XS8U2QN : One quick question, how many servers u used? What will be minimal cost to setup this?
U0NRYQNAZ : yea, i'm thinking i may need to do an example app for this now.
U0NRYQNAZ : do you already have a site you're trying to integrate this into?
U0NRYQNAZ : or your just interested in getting it going on your own site?
U5XS8U2QN : I want to integrate it to a website running on Django.
U0NRYQNAZ : <https://qbox.io/blog/how-to-elasticsearch-python-django-part1>
U5XS8U2QN : cost involved?
U0NRYQNAZ : oh idk the cost we had our own vm infrastructure.
U5XS8U2QN : How many VMs you used?
U0NRYQNAZ : there was a central server that ran logstash and the elastic search server with kibana so 2 servers. we also had another server running OSSEC.
U0NRYQNAZ : it's been a few years now. i've slept since then and don't remember all the details as i'm not involved in networking admin anymore.
U0NRYQNAZ : <https://qbox.io/blog/welcome-to-the-elk-stack-elasticsearch-logstash-kibana>
U0NRYQNAZ : i remember our biggest problem was storage.
U0NRYQNAZ : there was also grokking all the different kinds of logs.
U0NRYQNAZ : the one big gripe about ES is that it's easy to get data in there but hard to take it back out. to combat this while you save a document for EL to index you can also create a record in a relational db. this will help for other kinds of reporting.
U0NRYQNAZ : for logs we didn't care about the relational db part. we needed to analyze them in real-time and then archive them.
U0NRYQNAZ : you can also get ES running super quick with docker.
U5XS8U2QN : Why RDBMS and not MongoDB?
U0NRYQNAZ : well ES is already a document store. using something like Mongo would be redundant but i guess if you wanted to you could.
U0NRYQNAZ : it's generally not a good idea to try and do things a relational database can do in a document database like joins. i suggested saving to a rdbms in the process mainly so you can take advantage of an rdms at the same time. this won't be needed for every application.
U0NRYQNAZ : this is my docker-compose.yml for ES:```
version: '3'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: nickstenning/elasticsearch-icu
    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1:9200:9200'
```

you can type `docker-compose up` and it will start the service for you.

U5XS8U2QN : So I should store data in both, ES and RDBMS if I want to access it frequently?
U0NRYQNAZ : i don't know what you should do b/c i don't know the requirements i was just letting you know what you could do :wink:
U0NRYQNAZ : &gt; i suggested saving to a rdbms in the process mainly so you can take advantage of an rdbms at the same time. this won't be needed for every application.
U5XS8U2QN : Hmm. By storing document in RDBMS, did you mean creating schema based on keys in document?
U0NRYQNAZ : yea, you can save the data to the db and get back from the database the inserted record. That would look like this maybe `{"id": 1, "name": "a1gupta", "role": "1", "created_on": "2017-10-11 343434"}`. once you get what the database has you send it to ES.
U0NRYQNAZ : that's how you would make a search engine with ES btw. which is what i did recently. you can take those same values in the dict and pass them as query params to a search endpoint.
U5XS8U2QN : Thanks <@U0NRYQNAZ> . I think I should start now to understand it better. :upside_down_face:
U0NRYQNAZ : code it the way you see it :smiley: it looks like there may be a few problems to solve before getting to ES like getting the events you want.
U0NRYQNAZ : i'm sure there are some django plugins that can help you with that.
