how about that
change appropriately
thanks <@U5NMSURAQ>. however i quite dont understand how the other templates are used here in their order. maybe very beginner question
`for template in args` -- loop over all passed arguments (in order, as they are positional arguments)
return the first found main template, or the first found "len&lt;10" template
otherwise just return the last one

`os.system` returns 0
i. e. successful result
`os.system` calls a program (or a number of them) that you specify, and they print to the terminal; then `os.system` returns 0, because everything was successful; then you print `DISK_SPACE` and that's your 0.
what if i dont want to have that 0
i just want to have size of my disk
don't `print DISK_SPACE`
i can do if else on the basis of DISK_SPACE and this 0 wont interrupt me ????
... I don't understand.
Why bother writing to a file and then having python read it and email? Unless you are using that file for other usages, it's probably easiest to just call the subprocess from python and email based on your condition.

because os.system just spawns a bunch of processes with current context
`df` prints to the terminal
actually i just want to save that output to DISK_SIZE variable
