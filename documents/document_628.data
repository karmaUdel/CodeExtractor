```
Like Project, I have Deliverable, Contact, User, Team, TimeRecording.....
oh
so you could presumably do something like
`ProjectStructure user company contact -&gt; String`
Yes!
and inside it pattern matches on the argument 3 times
That's what I want.
first one looks like this
oh, sorry
`type alias`
hmm
And here is the thing. If I'm decoding `Project String String String` I don't need to embed anything. But if I'm decoding `Project User String String` I need to embed "created_by" and "owner".
