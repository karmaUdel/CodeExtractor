U1ALMRBLL : yes <@U624VJ533>, you can ask it here -- there is also a <#C053AK3F9|beginners> channel that you may find helpful if your issue is not resolved here
U624VJ533 : Hi <@U1ALMRBLL>, thank you for the response
U624VJ533 : I have been exploring core.async
U624VJ533 : and tried to implement <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs&amp;t=1600>
U624VJ533 : the gophers daisy chain whispering
U624VJ533 : and am stuck someplace
U624VJ533 : help would be appreciated
U1ALMRBLL : i would recommend you ask in <#C05423W6H|core-async> -- providing some details as to how specifically you are stuck
U624VJ533 : okay sure
U624VJ533 : thank you
U061RAB7C : How to make class self as type hint  for field of `deftype`?```
(deftype Foo [^some.ns.Foo parent])
```

U08UTJ5PB : Has anyone see this error when trying to start your repl: `Exception in thread "main" java.net.SocketException: Protocol family unavailable, compiling:`?
U051SS2EU : is this something that happens in every project, or only when loading a specific project's code?
U051SS2EU : sometimes I find that if I don't use lein's `init-ns` or `main` features, and just call require from user, the error is more informative
U051SS2EU : for example ```$ lein run -m clojure.mainuser=&gt; (require 'my.ns)```

U051SS2EU : then I get a better idea of what code is blowing up
U06BUCH6D : Does anyone know how to create a parameterized type instance (java interop)? E.g. new MyPType&lt;Integer&gt;
U051SS2EU : <@U06BUCH6D> that doesn't actually exist
U06BUCH6D : OK…because param types are only compile time, correct?
U051SS2EU : it's a thing the java compiler pretends is there, but isn't actually a thing in the relevant bytecode
U06BUCH6D : <@U051SS2EU> mith ok thx!
U051SS2EU : <@U06BUCH6D> right, type erasure (with the exception that you can use reflection to find the generic type - but that's not actually as relevant as one might think)
U051SS2EU : the important thing is the code just works without it
U06BUCH6D : True..I should have known :slightly_smiling_face: thx
