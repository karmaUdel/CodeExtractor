U3SJEDR96 : <https://github.com/elm-lang/virtual-dom/issues/98> "#100 - Controls get covered by elements with a higher z-index"
U3SJEDR96 : so all good :slightly_smiling_face:
U4872964V : is 999 enough? :slightly_smiling_face:
U1S70NKFF : elm-mini-controls cool thx
U1AN4JRFV : <@U1G51S63S>: what does this evaluate to? ` now: + new Date()`
U1G51S63S : <@U1AN4JRFV> just a timestamp
U1AN4JRFV : why the `+` tho?
U1AN4JRFV : just wondering, if you had a typo in there, that's all. not sure, what your initial issue was.
U1G51S63S : casting Date to Int :slightly_smiling_face: no, it's not an issue
U1AN4JRFV : yeah, no problem, i see it now, just looked off
U1AN4JRFV : as opposed to ```&gt; -new Date()-1501696693928
```

U1S70NKFF : yeah .elm-overlay { z-index: 999; } did the trick
U0S6BNVNY : I haven't had that issue before but I would just include some inline CSS that makes its z-index higher perhaps?
U0S6BNVNY : ahh I see you just did that
U1AN4JRFV : <@U1G51S63S>: maybe you have a redirect-rule that returns the index for a route not found, which leads to linking it twice?
U1AN4JRFV : (meaning, i now read your issue, and this is all i have to offer :slightly_smiling_face: )
U1G51S63S : <@U1AN4JRFV> thought about this already. removed routing (navigation/url-parser) at all - didn't helped :disappointed:
U1AN4JRFV : i'd click through all the responses in the dev-console after a fresh reload and check if any of them returned the index.
U1AN4JRFV : other than index.html, of course
U1G51S63S : nope, it's not. google maps really loaded twice btw. first time w/o api key and second one with it
U1AN4JRFV : so, did you get it? is it mapping?
U1G51S63S : no, I still have no idea why it's loading twice
U1G51S63S : I am just added debug log to `googleMap` function (which returns Html.node) and it's called once
U4872964V : so, it’s loading as a response to that DOM element being created, you could compare the stack trace for the two loads
U4872964V : maybe something funny is going on with the DOM node being created twice, or the attribute added later or something
U66RFDZ8F : I decided to go with Elm for a major project, contrary to RedInk's advice to start small
U66RFDZ8F : I don't regret it
U66RFDZ8F : absolutely amazing!
U4872964V : <@U66RFDZ8F> if you _can_ go big, you should :slightly_smiling_face:U3SQ42JJW

U66RFDZ8F : <@U3SQ42JJW> maybe?
```
List.range (Tuple.first record.range) (Tuple.second record.range)
```

U3SQ42JJW : sorry for double posting :disappointed: Thanks <@U66RFDZ8F> :slightly_smiling_face:
U1G51S63S : <@U4872964V> huh, thats funny. just noticed it's present in chrome only - works fine in FF or Safari. error happens in jquery (there is no jquery on my site ofc) even in incognito mode with all extensions disabled :smile: will try to figure it out now
U329ZV5T8 : Anybody have experience swapping out part of an Angular 1 application for an Elm module?
U329ZV5T8 : Should I start with a service or controller or directive or what?
U66RFDZ8F : Is the default `Array` implementation still broken?
U3SJEDR96 : Yeah, it will be fixed in the next release of `elm-lang/core` which will most likely coincide with 0.19
U66RFDZ8F : I see `Array.Hamt` is available, but can I decode to it?
U66RFDZ8F : or `elm-array-exploration`
U23SA861Y : decode it?
