How do you define months in this context?
<@U5LNXQHN3> sorry?
A month is not a fixed unit of time (at least not in the cultures I know of)
I need to know how many months have passed between two dates
If you want the intuitive answer then I think you will just have to check the difference in years and months individually
for example I started it today - June 2017, and the end - June 2016. The difference - 12 months
I think the best way is to pass the Python...
Does this work? `((endDay.year - startDay.year) * 12) + (endDay.month - startDay.month)`
works
Thank you. You are a genius.
You can't use timedelta for this because a span of 30 days is over a month if the span starts on Feb 1st and under a month if the span starts on Jan 1st
no problem
exactly...
<@U2BS4M1RV> if you self host, there is no limit
I would recommend that. With docker its really not all that hard to host it
thats what I do. All similar systems will have some type of limit. There is also bugsnag, and rollbar, but they all have limits
self hosting is the only way to have no limits. Oh, I guess google cloud has one called stack-driver that is just a flat monthly fee + minimal data charges
use `dateutil`
or `maya` or `arrow`, etc
That's cheating :wink:
