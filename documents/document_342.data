Great, this is making sense.  I'll give it a go.  Thanks!
`JD.field "title" (JD.map Title JD.string)`
We do just this thing for our `Id` decoder <https://gist.github.com/coreyhaines/5f2a8d15de99ce91adbb10ac855172b1#file-id-elm-L20-L22>
makes it easier to use in a pipeline while decoding other fields
hey everybody, I am trying to get unique values out of a list I have a nasty big function which works, and I am wondering if there is a much nicer more FP way to do it?
<https://ellie-app.com/3J7tc7ykKZqa1/10>
any hints appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:
nvm I found <https://github.com/elm-community/elm-list-extra/blob/master/src/List/Extra.elm>
Which has a) the dropDuplicates function and b) juicy lecker source code :slightly_smiling_face:
Using a `Set` is the best way to do this, indeed. The one in `List.Extra` preserves order - if you don't need that, you can just `unique = Set.fromList &gt;&gt; Set.toList`
oh wow, even sneakier!
thanks!
i gather that the update portion of the architecture happens on the requestAnimationFrame, right? if there are multiple messages to be processed, they are sequentially handled in the same order they were sent?
