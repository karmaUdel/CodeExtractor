Thank you! Unfortunately, it doesn't work :disappointed:
wait.. so in your code snipet, it's supposed to return F, T, T, F?
I tried to add valid ones.
I'm confused also :smile:
All day working at one task, and finally done 90%, but this thing get me mad :smile:
haven't forgotten about you, milo.
I think I'm going to get banned for this but the problem is that it needs some way of determining what is being passed (string, or list)
so if list, and first element exists and that first element is 'None', then it is empty
also, if val does not exist (None or empty), it is also True (is_empty)
