```Posting messages with buttons requires registering a Slack app. Interactive messages cannot be posted using a custom integration. Create an app if you don't already have one.```
Actually an app
Okay. I was just wondering if there's another way around it. hehe :stuck_out_tongue:
I've got a slack app setup already, and I did read that I need a request url. Just wondering if I could do so without that. Thanks!
when we design a the event type base bot, is there a way to make a sequential conversion?
sure just call <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage> in the right order u want the conversation to flow rite?
<@U3FGRUSLT> yes~
is there a good way to tell the conversion finished? I know this is a silly question~:relieved:
unless the human types "/end" or something
it would have to be AI to know when the human is done
yeah, that's what I'm currently doing as well
i have same problem with my wife. i think conevrsation is done but she keeps talking lol just kidding
^ lol
<@U3FGRUSLT>  just /end her ¯\_(?)_/¯
"honey i said slash end. I SAID SLASH END"
hey, do we have any bot framework written in scala (or python)
<#C0J3CL5V1|language-python> (no scala channels though)
My intention Slack &lt;--- Bot ----&gt; Service.
so our service just focus on processing the message instead of worry about how to handle communicating with slack.
Event bots now can be shown as online. <https://twitter.com/mbrevoort/status/811602847326408705>
RTM messages keep being sent
they are repeated 3, 4, 10 times
Same - slack services is messed up right now
<https://status.slack.com/>
&gt;Web and API requests are continuing to time out: meaning that for some, image &amp; file uploads and bots and things may be impacted. Basically, all is not as it should be, but we're working hard to get things back to normal as quickly as possible.
:poop:
yeah, slack is fucked for one hour
I have to take Smooz offline
it keeps sending messages in a loop
even the DM I send to users to apologize is sent 3-4 times :poop: :poop: :poop:
We've deactivate Mailclark incoming emails for more than one hour now. Happy christmas :slightly_smiling_face:
what were you seing ?
<@U0FQHMRU3> ?
Slack API Time out
some loops in posted messages
_We will update this page with more information as it becomes available._
looks like we're also not getting all events delivered
When Slack will be up, we will have to restart service, reprocess all queue emails and messages and respond at customers that don't understand what happen... very bad afternoon for me
so RTM sends messages multiple times, and Events API dont get delivered
yeah, for me Smooz has sent some messages 10-20 times
users are pissed off
some API methods are returning instead of an error a whole HMLT page
which cause hundreds of useless lines in my log
the problem that I see is that users may think that is OUR problem but it is actually not
would be great if there is some sort of notification at the client level notifying about the issue and that some apps may not work as expected
<@U0JPS3SHX> The service as a whole is currenlty degraded
Indeed <@U0JPS3SHX> a client-level apologize would be great
already taking flack from users
ping <@U0D7LHNTX> <@U07CW6N3A> (although they might be busy at the moment :D)
i can't add :+1: reactions to your messages :disappointed:
<@U3EFK8UES> yes I am aware, thanks!
yeah, many parts are broken
not just api
yeah.. try to to create a new channel
i wonder what happened
let say, for apps, bug seems to be more spectacular
maybe I will put a switch in my backend like “slack down” and then just respond to users with a generic message
<@U0JPS3SHX> are you using RTM ?
<@U0FQHMRU3> and you ?
<@U04SM6T2H> reported that events API seems unaffected, or not as bad
I use it for my bot status (which I dont need now) and for some events but I do not really on it
so I am “ok”
only for receiveing events, not for posting messages
but there is a unstable kind of feeling lol
This should be done only if the services are not available for more than _X_ minutes. 
I'll talk about this with Slack team :raised_hands: :thumbsup_all: 
Hi people, <@U04SM6T2H> <@U3020AK8U> and I have been working on this for a little while - a Botkit+bCRM integration to make it easy for you guys to get a CRM for your bot. <http://venturebeat.com/2016/12/22/howdy-brings-bcrm-to-its-botkit-to-manage-marketing-campaigns-for-slack-and-facebook-messenger/> Ben literally started coding as soon as we started talking about this at the last Botness meetup in NY - which is probably why and how he and his team are able to ship so freak'n fast.

<@U0HBN0L9M> I was totally unable to log into any of my teams this morning :disappointed: I only just now got your message.
I read document and see that I need to use Event API instead.
Permission Scopes: commands, chat:write:bot, incoming-webhook
<@U3JDGUZ2N> I believe you need to make Slack App or Bot user for interactive buttons 
Slash commands don't have button APIs afaik 
Try adding 'bot' as well to your list of scopes to see if that works 
and <https://api.slack.com/slash-commands>
Is there any good solution for us?
what language are u using to call this api <https://api.slack.com/methods/files.upload> ? like is it golang or php or what are you coding in?
I am using the botkit solution (nodejs) and I was wondering if there is way to use interactive message callbacks to update the original message (with the selected option for example). For now I have only managed to work with the selected options, but no user feedback can be provided.
My question is concerning conversations - simple messages with a single response is not the problem
<@U3JGXARTM> you could manually call the api method to edit the messgae yourself 
Hello all! I'm an undergrad who would really like to explore the fundamentals of chatbots. I'm interested in working with botkit, and have been following this tutorial <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-studio-starter>. The issue is... I need to acquire a botkit studio token from <https://studio.botkit.ai/signup>. It would mean a great deal if anyone can send me an invite code. Thanks!
<@U3JUYM4QJ> just fyi: you don't need botkit studio to create a bot with botkit :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U0KECURAT> ah okay, got stuck for a while.. this will help. Thank you!
<@U3EFK8UES>: thanks. I will try this then.
