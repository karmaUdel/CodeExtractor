U04SM6T2H : hey <@U0H8KT3AN>
U04SM6T2H : the storage is empty yes
U04SM6T2H : you would have to build your own caching scheme
U04SM6T2H : and I wouldn't recommend using the storage for caching
U04SM6T2H : since it is persistent
U0H8KT3AN : yeah, I realized that looking at it more
U04SM6T2H : its really more for storing data on behalf of the team
U0H8KT3AN : just doing a quick flattened object
U04SM6T2H : just a simple starting point
U0H8KT3AN : Does botkit do any auto marking messages as read?
U0FSRDKHN : <@U0H8KT3AN>: Are you using the ```client``` oauth scope?
U0FSRDKHN : Because if not, you're not able to mark messages as read on behalf of a user.
U0H8KT3AN : <@U0FSRDKHN>: I'm just using the user generated token for now as a prototype. It works for what I'm doing: <https://github.com/shaunburdick/slack-ooo-personal/tree/1.0-alpha>
U0GRM401W : Does anyone know how to mass invite a bot to all of your channels?
U0H8KT3AN : can't think of any
U0H8KT3AN : you could always program the bot to join a list of channels on connection?
U0H8KT3AN : lol, you could create a nosy bot that joins all channels and listens for any new channel to join them too
U04SM6T2H : Bots actually cannot automatically join channels
U04SM6T2H : They have to be invited 
U0H8KT3AN : aww, there goes my plans for a First bot, joins every channel and yells 'First!1!!'
U0CSBGTKM : Can you use a normal user's API key to do the inviting? (e.g. JKerrUserBot joins a channel, invites FirstBot to a channel and automatically leaves after First got joins.)
U0H8KT3AN : you might, <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.join> only mentions errors of `user_is_bot` and `user_is_restricted`
U0H8KT3AN : just hop in, call <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.invite> on the other bot and hop out
U0GQ4GVPY : Happy holidays!
U0GQ4GVPY : Have a great day

U0HBN0L9M : Hello all 
U0HC6GMEV : hi
U0H1Y7M1S : hello :simple_smile:
U0FHTRT7F : Happy Holidays bot makers !
U0H9S58BS : Happy holidays all.  Question - are there any slack groups with most of the available bots added already, so we could play with them?
U0CSRV1TR : That's a fun idea
U0HBN0L9M : haha :simple_smile:
U0HBN0L9M : botlandia
U0D7F12ER : “botland” sounds like someone from southie boston saying “portland"
U0H1Y7M1S : +1 that would be cool :simple_smile: #botlandia
U0GPSB7V1 : can bots with RTM tokens make calls to snooze my notifications?
U0GPSB7V1 : cuz that would be awesome
U0GPSB7V1 : i guess i could look that up myself...
U0HBN0L9M : bots with rtm token? wouldn't it be redundant?
U0HF8MQGG : yo
U0HF8MQGG : Hello, bots.
U0HF8MQGG : I'm trying to figure out how to think about the application I'm building
U0HF8MQGG : Do i have a way to integrate custom settings?
U0HF8MQGG : Like a place to prompt the user to add my apps token
U0AFABJAJ : <@U0HF8MQGG>: The app token comes back to your app via oauth: <https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth>
U0AFABJAJ : If this is a bot packages through your app, that access token comes back through oauth as well if you use the `bot` oauth scope <https://api.slack.com/bot-users>
U0AFABJAJ : s/packages/packaged
U0HBN0L9M : yep, this new oauth bot token is a blessing
U0HBN0L9M : no more copy pasting
U0HDXGVDF : I only have the quick start code in the file.
U0HBN0L9M : not specifically familiar with botkit but you have put your own tokens in it?
U0HDXGVDF : oops wrong channel! yes, I do have my token. I get an error otherwise.
U0HDXGVDF : turns out if no error was thrown, you are connected. took me way too long to figure that out lol.
U0HDXGVDF : perhaps there should be a confirmation message such as “connected"
U0HFVKNMR : Hi all, thanks for the invite! tldr intro: Auckland based full time graduate BA + late nights building an anonymous employee feedback platform (<http://www.feedbaq.io|www.feedbaq.io>). Keen to see what bots I can conjure up, including one for Feedbaq. Happy new year from beautiful New Zealand.
U0CR53UMR : It's not my bot but I know the dev Marc, but this is probably my most consistently used bot over the last few months: <http://son.gg/slack-integration/>
U0GPKTHQ9 : Is there a way to get the timestamp of a message without using the RTM API?
U0HBN0L9M : yes, there is a ts
U0HBN0L9M : message.ts
U0GPKTHQ9 : but that's an event right? can't you only get that with the real time messaging API?
U0GPKTHQ9 : ahh, I might be able to do it using search: <https://api.slack.com/methods/search.messages>
It's a massive Oauth scope though... All I want to do is add reactions :disappointed:

U0HGE5E13 : :wave:
U04SM6T2H : :simple_smile:
U0HBN0L9M : <@U0GPKTHQ9>: sorry « without » I read « with »
U0HBN0L9M : how about channels.history ?
U0HGGV5MZ : Hi all, I'm actually on the business side of our startup but I've been working on integrating bots and apis in my free time. One of the only languages I know is Python since it's among the easiest so I actually built a howdy-like platform around the rtm api and python client which connects to various bot commands, all in python. Is there any way to integrate python development into howdy? 
U0CSBGTKM : From my understanding, Howdy is a closed system, so direct integrations from any language aren't possible yet. What would you need to integrate into Howdy?
U04SM6T2H : <@U0HGGV5MZ>: hey, ben from howdy here
U04SM6T2H : <@U0HGGV5MZ>: we would to hear about the type of thing you'd like to integrate into howdy
U04SM6T2H : we are planning for ways to integrate external services.
U0HGGV5MZ :  Definitely, I think it's more like a howdy-equivalent on python but I'm sure if I shared my repo, you could get a better sense. I'll tweak some minor things and then happy to share with the team 
U0EEJ081W : I just installed botkit, added the integration to my testchannel, got the tokenid and am now running the bot on my laptop with command%  token=xoxb-1234546-abcdefg  node bot.js
But getting stuck at     "BOT ID:  bigbot  ...attempting to connect to RTM!"
Cant interact with the bot on  my testchannel.   Anything I should be looking at ?

U0EEJ081W : Sorry … Just saw the other messages prior to this ….  and realized that it IS connected and just need to send a DM to it..
U0HJT3449 : This may be a daft question but... I've just installed botkit and am trying to run the sample at <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/bot.js> 
I get this error...

"module.js:340
    throw err;
    ^
Error: Cannot find module './lib/Botkit.js'"

The path seems fine and there seems to be nothing useful on Stack Overflow.  I found a npm-debug.log in my project folder that has stuff like...

"verbose addNameTag registry:<https://registry.npmjs.org/Botkit.js> not in flight; fetching" and "error 404 Registry returned 404 for GET on <https://registry.npmjs.org/Botkit.js>"

Grateful for any help...

U09S0D71P : <@U0HJT3449>: my hunch is you put "botkit.js" in your package.json. Seems like it's just "botkit"
U09S0D71P : npm install --save botkit
U0HJT3449 : And, as if by magic… Thanks very much <@U09S0D71P>
U09S0D71P : :+1:
U0HJYQG1E : I would like to collaborate with a developer (in SF) to build a couple of custom integrations with Slack. ping me if you are interested.
U0FSRDKHN : <@U0HJYQG1E> I'm usually in <#C0HK02UNN> but right now I'm in <#C0HK08G94> with my friend @djan. If that could work I'd be interested in hearing about your project.
U0HJXBKE0 : <@U0FSRDKHN> in <#C0HKBJ0HY>: If anyone is into facebook you can join the Botkit Developer's facebook group: &lt;https://www.facebook.com/groups/botkit/&gt; <#C04SM6TAK>
U0HK9D8AG : Botkit works on windows 10, correct?
U0HERRQR1 : Yes it works in all operating systems <@U0HK9D8AG>
U0HK9D8AG : Making sure, I was getting some install errors earlier, so I'm reinstalling everything.
U0HERRQR1 : Can you send us the installation errors for further assistance?
U0HK9D8AG : Yeah, as soon as I make sure it wasn't a problem with the install.
U0HK9D8AG : It is having even more trouble than before.
U0HK9D8AG : I think it is using the wrong directory, how do I fix that?
U0HK9D8AG : <http://pastebin.com/jEynQSkQ>
U0HK9D8AG : I'm new to NPM, sorry if I'm being a bit of an idiot
U0HERRQR1 : What is your npm &amp; node version?
U0HERRQR1 : this is a problem with library `ws`
U0HK9D8AG : let me check
U0HK9D8AG : I just installed the latest nodejs
U0HERRQR1 : ```Can't find Python executable "python", you can set the PYTHON env variable.```
U0HK9D8AG : oh
U0HERRQR1 : there exist a stackoverflow question <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21365714/nodejs-error-installing-with-npm>
U0HERRQR1 : ```So to install it on windows you must first :Install python: <http://www.python.org/getit/windows/>
Install Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2012 Express version: <http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9816758>
Install node-gyp: npm install -g node-gyp
Here is a similar article: <http://www.bitcrunch.de/install-couchbase-node-js-windows-8-machine/>```

U0HK9D8AG : Thank you. Either I forgot to reinstall it, or it wasn't in the first place
U0HERRQR1 : Probably
U0HERRQR1 : not a problem btw. feel free to message me in priv. if you have any further questions on this manner
U0HK9D8AG : alright
