U0ALQHJRF : uses edn and a template to generate a default UI or you can provide an alternate template or final cljs file for the ui
U5Z4ECHCM : Hate to interrupt, but I'm having trouble splitting up the middleware for my different routes in Compojure
U5Z4ECHCM : Anyone have information / a blog post / etc on the topic?
U46LFMYTD : I have a question about structural sharing in nested maps. Suppose I have a map called mymap that looks like this```
mymap
=&gt; {:mykey [{:A 1, :B 2} {:A 2, :B 2} {:A 3, :B 2}]}
```
I want to write a function that goes down and increments each value for :A
I can do this with
```
(assoc mymap :mykey (map #(assoc % :A (inc (:A %))) (:mykey mymap)))
{:mykey ({:A 2, :B 2} {:A 3, :B 2} {:A 4, :B 2})}
```
do the keys :B "point to the same place in memory" after this modification as the original maps? That is, is there structural sharing going on between the maps in the vector before and after this modification?

U0CHY4VNW : Asymmetry in `string/split` and `string/join` makes me sad : ( ```        parts (string/split kafka #":")        host (string/join ":" (butlast parts))
```

U5NAUMCAD : Hi all, I am trying to write some test in clojure and I need to do some Mocks and proxies, however I cannot figure out how to proxy some java objects and methods
I have this function

U5NAUMCAD : ``` (defn singletest  [cert]
  (let [x500principal (.getSubjectX500Principal cert)
        dn (.getName x500principal)]
    (apply str "abcdefg"))) ```

U5NAUMCAD : cert is a java object of type X509CertImpl
U5NAUMCAD : I know that I am not using x500principal and dn; but it is an example
U5NAUMCAD : However I am having a hard time trying to do the test
U5NAUMCAD : ``` (deftest singletest  (let [cert (.X509CertImpl)
        x500principal (proxy [X509CertImpl] []
                       (getSubjectX500Principal [] nil))
        dn (proxy [X500Principal] []
                       (getName [] "works"))]
       (is (= "" (c/singletest cert))))) ```

U5NAUMCAD : throws me java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Malformed member expression, expecting (.member target ...)
U5NAUMCAD : any idea??
U5NAUMCAD : someone has worked with certificates before :sob::sob:
U050MP39D : what is c?
U050MP39D : c/singletest looks like a syntax error
U050MP39D : oh sorry no it's not
U050MP39D : god I'm tired
U5NAUMCAD : no worries
U050MP39D : this (.X509CertImpl)
U050MP39D : is invalid syntax
U050MP39D : I think you want (new X509CertImpl) or (X509CertImpl.) (latter preferred generally)
U5NAUMCAD : I change it to ``` (deftest singletest
  (let [cert (proxy [X509CertImpl] []
               (getSubjectX500Principal [] nil))
        x500principal (proxy [X500Principal] []
                       (getName [] "works"))]
       (is (= "" (c/singletest cert))))) ```

U5NAUMCAD : but I am getting
U5NAUMCAD : java.lang.VerifyError: Cannot inherit from final class
U5NAUMCAD : this is because X500Principal is a final class
U5NAUMCAD : then how can I work around that
U050MP39D : I think you want to implement java.security.Principal not X500Principal
U5NAUMCAD : the problem is that I have everything working!
U050MP39D : ditto you probably want to implement X509Certificate not X509CertImpl (program against abstractions, not concretions)
U5NAUMCAD : I mean, the only thing left is the test
U050MP39D : ok, test code is still code though
