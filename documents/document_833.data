U5VCDE5SS : if that's the point, then ignore this, but i was under the impression that it would highlight a smaller subset of the code
U5VGKQ2SY : Here is my solution for <http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html>
U5VGKQ2SY : Questions1) Is there a cleaner/better way to verify input than the while...try...except block I used?
2) I am repeating error string in "except" and in last line of while loops. Any way to have it err while only having that error message in code once?
3) Lines 17 - 23. How can I do isalpha(strip(fname)) in python? do I have to fname = strip(input...) on line 19?
4) Open to any suggestions on how to improve/optimize that code.

U5Z2JR6JH : Good day Pythonist, does anyone can help me about my django template varaible {{SITE_NAME}} because i can't see it from the template even in view by request.SITE_NAME
U5Z2JR6JH : thanks in advance
U5LNXQHN3 : Is there a generally-accepted 'best' unit-testing package? Or is it a subjective choice between nose, py.test, etc?
U5NMSURAQ : `pytest`!
U5NMSURAQ : no thinking required
U5LNXQHN3 : What are the advantages? I'm not a big fan of the setup/teardown syntax, but I could get used to it.
U5NMSURAQ : really easy fixtures, parametrized tests
U5NMSURAQ : ```@pytest.mark.parametrize("test_input,expected", [
    ("3+5", 8),
    ("2+4", 6),
    ("6*9", 42),
])
def test_eval(test_input, expected):
    assert eval(test_input) == expected
```

U5NMSURAQ : And I really like how you don't need classes, because you really don't.
U5LNXQHN3 : Okay. I'll try it for a week. And if I don't like it, I'll blame you. :wink:
U5NMSURAQ : :dizzy_face:
U5LNXQHN3 : thanks
U5Z1XCCAE : Hi there! I'm working with a fairly big set, adding many items in a loop, i'm using Jupyter notebook on a anaconda environment on Windows. At some point after 5 or 6 million elements the function 'all_combinations.add(''.join(tuples))' Fails with 'MemoryError: ' Any idea?
U5LNXQHN3 : It could be that your data set is just too big for the amount of RAM in your computer. Are you using 64 bit Anaconda or 32 bit?
U5Z1XCCAE : i just found out that the python env that i'm using in anaconda is 32 bit, i'll try with the 64 bit version. it's strange anyway as i was monitoring the amount of ram used and it never went up of more that 200/300 MB on a 16GB ram machine
U5LNXQHN3 : It could be that the operation you wanted to perform tried to allocate 2GB or more in one go and failed, meaning you never saw it go from 300MB to an intended 2300MB (or similar)
U486CN4VD : ~Can a generator be used here?~
U5Z1XCCAE : kylotan, by chance, do you know how to create a 64 bit python anaconda environment?
U5LNXQHN3 : anaconda offers downloads of each - you'd probably want to uninstall the 32 bit version and install the 64 bit one
U5Z1XCCAE : i usually tend to install the 64 bit version the of software i use, is there a way to verify that indeed my anaconda installation is a 64 bit one? running python inside an environment says 32 bit
U5LNXQHN3 : Task Manager shows whether each running process is 32 or 64 bit
U5LNXQHN3 : Not sure how to verify the installation itself, since I don't use anaconda personally.
U5VFKBW2Z : hello is there a way  to execute "curl '<http://example.cm/bla>' --data '{"method":"wallet_new_address"}'" but in python way?
U29163YQH : look at this module :slightly_smiling_face:
U5VFKBW2Z : using this &gt;&gt;&gt; payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}&gt;&gt;&gt; r = requests.get('<http://httpbin.org/get>', params=payload)

U5VFKBW2Z : does the '--data' count?
U5ZPMJA06 : I think when you use --data with curl, it will do a HTTP POST request, with the data in the request body.
U5ZPMJA06 : To do the same with `requests`, you'd use `r = <http://requests.post|requests.post>("<http://httpbin.org/post>", data=payload)`
U5ZPMJA06 : So, `<http://requests.post|requests.post>()` instead of `requests.get()` to make a HTTP POST request.
U5VFKBW2Z : ok, thanks you
U5VFKBW2Z : gonna try that one
U0LSCQQNR : <@U5VFKBW2Z> all the HTTP verbs correspond to a method in `requests`.  Therefore, `PUT` translates to `requests.put(...)`, `GET` as `requests.get(...)`, and so on
U0LSCQQNR : <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/>
U2TQBG484 : Hi everyone. Which service or tool for crawling website with javascript? For me i used phantomjs and selenium. But their performance is so poor.
U5ZPMJA06 : I often use `requests` in combination with `BeautifulSoup` (using the `lxml` parser).
U5ZPMJA06 : However, that's not a JavaScript solution. Sorry!
U13L8J76J : <@U2TQBG484> is this some sort of single page web app?
U2TQBG484 : Kind of. Because some pages need to excute javasript for rendering full content. So i have to find some browser which can excute javascript for making dynamic crawler.
U2TQBG484 : But according to real life experience. I see phantomjs or selenium is so slow
U2TQBG484 : one minute they can only render 5-6 page
U2TQBG484 : Which cannot serve my purpose
U5ZPMJA06 : Maybe spread the workload out to multiple VMs and let each do a part of the URLspace?
U13L8J76J : <@U2TQBG484> can't you just repeat queries that javascript is making and get the data from the backend directly?
U2TQBG484 : Can i make DM with you <@U13L8J76J> ?
U13L8J76J : Let's keep our conversation public
U13L8J76J : I'm not the only one who can help you
U2TQBG484 : Ok. I'm afraid that i will mess our channel.So the problem is i'm making a crawler which can extract the article main content of any news website.

U2TQBG484 : So for making that i have to get the css and javascript for detecting which is article page and navigation page.
U2TQBG484 : My only bottleneck is page rendering tools. For this i used phantomjs and selenium.
U2TQBG484 : But with their pool performances i can't really use this for production
U13L8J76J : Yeah, you said that a couple of times already.
U5Y9Z9FPS : and not the only who need to solve it
U13L8J76J : <@U2TQBG484> have you seen my previous question?
U2TQBG484 : Yup already. But it can't help. Some web pages make different requests ajax for rendering full content each page. So if i write some algorithm for detecting those request format and fake it. It will make my issue extremely complex. So for reducing the complex, i used some service which can return me the full content after javascript executing.
U2TQBG484 : <@U13L8J76J> and sorry for repeating my issue. I just want to centralize again all of my issue.
U13L8J76J : You still have to parse the returned page, right? Then how parsing different parts is it more complex than rendering everything and parsing parts as a whole?
U13L8J76J : You don't need to write an algorithm to detect requests. You just need to open the page, to look into web inspector and copy-paste related queries from "Network" tab
U13L8J76J : That's pretty much it
U2TQBG484 : Because I have to find a way to deal with “Any” pages not for specific one as you suggest.
U13L8J76J : You have to find a way to deal with all pages you're interested in, yes.If that's such a huge problem, then your only way is to use selenium/headless chrome/whatever

U2TQBG484 : Yes, so i want to ask if someone had deal with this problem already.
U5ZPMJA06 : <@U2TQBG484> Apparently your problem is slowness and lack of processing capacity. Maybe using multiple machines is an option?
U5ZPMJA06 : I mean, instead of machine 1 processing news sites A, B and C in succession, you start 3 machines, where machine 1 will process news site A, machine 2 news site B and machine 3 news site C. That will give a 3x speedup.
U2TQBG484 : Yes i've already done that. But i wonder if there is some tool can do this better than phantomjs either selenium. Right now i used 3 servers but only 200 page/ minute has been rendered.I used cache and proxy and image replacing for reducing the time cost. But it is only slightly better

U5NMSURAQ : sorry to interject, i haven't read everything, but one instance per core (minus 1-2 cores for main process) gives us about 30 headless browsers per machine
U5NMSURAQ : on a second-to-largest GCC instance
U5NMSURAQ : also, headless chrome :heart:
U2TQBG484 : I used to open 10 instance of headless browser per machine. But the time cost increases with instance of headless browser. More instance ---&gt; more time for rendering.
U2TQBG484 : I don't know if i'm doing something wrong with that
U5NMSURAQ : how many cores on these machines?
U2TQBG484 : 8 cores.
U5NMSURAQ : 10 is too many then :slightly_smiling_face:
U2TQBG484 : Anywho thanks for your suggestion with headless chrome. I will take a try with it
U2TQBG484 : :slightly_smiling_face:
U0LSCQQNR : so, phantom is notorious for being slow, and having problems
U0LSCQQNR : not surprising since its been a one-person project for a number of years now.  given the challenges of browser development, phantom's state of functionality is impressive with that restriction
U0LSCQQNR : however, it is now deprecated and no longer supported since headless chrome came out
U0LSCQQNR : and unfortunately, this is an instance of where horizontal scaling will have to be used, where you distribute the tasks to be executed among a cluster of similar instances
U0LSCQQNR : just like with celery workers, there's a sweet spot that can be hit with tasks on each machine for optimium efficiency, but that takes alot of experimenting to do.
U0LSCQQNR : <@U2TQBG484> what instance size are you running this on, and what provider?  AWS, GCC, Azure?
U2TQBG484 : It's running on my own server company. Not provided by any companies above.
U0LSCQQNR : then your only option is to either reduce the rate of crawling or add more hardware
U0LSCQQNR : because the primary issue is rendering the page and there is a significant lack of options for that
U2TQBG484 : Thanks for your advice Jason.
U0LSCQQNR : good luck
U5ZSL7770 : how do i set the size to python from openpyxl.chart  BarChart
U486CN4VD : <@U5ZSL7770>, did you see this SO thread?
U486CN4VD : <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36603753/openpyxl-change-the-dimension-of-a-chart>
U5ZSL7770 : thanks i fixed
U5ZSL7770 : it
U5ZSL7770 : thanks
U486CN4VD : heh, nice!
U5ZSL7770 : <@U486CN4VD> how do i auto ajust a graph in an excel file?
U486CN4VD : I'm not sure what you mean by auto adjust.
U5ZSL7770 : because i have alot of data and the graph just its small and i can't view the graph
U5ZSL7770 : i don't want the BarChart  to distort
U486CN4VD : So you want to write a BarChart to an excel sheet that's large enough to view both x and y axis?
U5ZSL7770 : hi there anyone know how can i add a chart pie with persentages <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/example_chart_pie.html>
U1BP42MRS : Has anyone converted a batch process to something more evented? Language or ecosystem isn't necessarily relevant - I just am curious of the paths people may have taken
U5LNXQHN3 : Only to the degree of going from "big batch process" to "cron job or HTTP request -&gt; tiny bit of big batch process"
U5NMSURAQ : <@U5ZSL7770> `chart.add_series({..., 'data_labels': {'percentage': True}})`
U5ZSL7770 : have you got any guide
U5ZSL7770 : ??
U5NMSURAQ : <https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter/blob/3588b318cbabd318c88ad4cb232f10a820705402/dev/docs/source/working_with_charts.rst#chart-series-option-data-labels>
U5NMSURAQ : there is an example for line charts there, but the principle is the same for pie charts
U5MV460AG : Where I can find some projects to really get started at programming? Maybe an abstract question but, 1 year programming (and like two months in Python [I was fallen in love of Java, then I hated it]).
U5MV460AG : Then (today) I realized I need to put my -tiny- knowledge in practice...
U5PJK7JHE : hmm there are lot of MOOC's i.e. Coursera (which has introduction classes) and there are sites like HackerRack, code academy to help to code :slightly_smiling_face:
U5PJK7JHE : hope that helps
U28MDQRL2 : <@U5MV460AG> <https://github.com/karan/Projects> that may help you
U5MV460AG : Thanks, as I said, I know how to code, I'm searching for real-life projects to get real stress :stuck_out_tongue:
U1BP42MRS : <@U5MV460AG> Depends on what gets you excited :slightly_smiling_face: I started by automating away silly things I had to do for work every day. Later as I knew more I started writing some web-apps
U1BP42MRS : You can do a clone of a site you like, something that tracks movies and how you like them, etc
U5MV460AG : <@U1BP42MRS> Looks so difficult to me :disappointed:
U1BP42MRS : Which part?
1. Automate repetitive tasks: This should be pretty small to start, maybe you check for a stock price every day. Just do it with python instead of logging into a website

2. Small webapp: This is much bigger since you need to also know HTML and CSS

U42LCHFD2 : thats how I also got started <@U1BP42MRS>   - i still get excited about all the new ways to do things, that I learn every day lol
U5MV460AG : Will try it, If I get stuck... Well, this is why the channel was made :stuck_out_tongue:
U5NT83K1C : I'm trying to convert the categorical values to dummy numerical. but I get error. how can i fix it?
U5CRANMFV : ```  &lt;script async src="{{ site.baseurl }}/scripts/loadCSS.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  &lt;noscript&gt;
    &lt;link href="{{ site.baseurl }}/style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
  &lt;/noscript&gt;```
but if I need to add another stylesheet, how to do it?

U5LNXQHN3 : You can have as many link elements as you want
U5CRANMFV : and where do I add styles?in noscript? - it's not working.

U5LNXQHN3 : The noscript stuff only runs when there is no script. So I'm guessing that 'loadCSS.min.js' handles all your stylesheets. I'm guessing that's part of some client-side framework you're using
U5CRANMFV : In General, I can't understand how to make styles with loadcss
U5LNXQHN3 : Why are you using it?
U5CRANMFV : ```  &lt;script async src="{{ site.baseurl }}/scripts/loadCSS.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  &lt;noscript&gt;
    &lt;link href="{{ site.baseurl }}/style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
  &lt;/noscript&gt;```
this example is not correct?
Want to speed up the website and listen to `google page speed`, <@U5LNXQHN3>

U5LNXQHN3 : You need to understand how loadCSS works if you want to use it
U5CRANMFV : it true:slightly_frowning_face:
U5LNXQHN3 : The standard way to use CSS is the `&lt;link&gt;` element, as seen in the noscript section. If you have those link elements outside of the noscript, they will work
