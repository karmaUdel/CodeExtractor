very good man
so easy
ahauuaa
<@U57JJD5S8> virtualenv won't change the underlying problem, unfortunately. It just changes where the final packages get stored
yeah
i cant edit setup.py to remove #include io.h for some reason
Why do you think there is that include inside setup.py?
#include is a C/C++ construct, setup.py is Python
idk, tbh
this is my first time setting up a python environment
some cursory googling makes this sound like a VS issue
yeah
ive installed all i can
llo
lol
i believe its vs2015_runtime because anaconda automatically installs that one for me
however when i try to install it myself in venv i am getting the io.h issues
or maybe that is still a completely separate issue
the fact that it cannot detect bitfield in anaconda even though i am looking right at the package is weird to me
because VS doesn't know where to look for the header: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40018405/cython-cannot-open-include-file-io-h-no-such-file-or-directory>
yeah i remember trying that two days ago
i forgot why it wasnt working
should try again today
I know I mentioned it earlier but references to io.h are usually a bad sign on Windows, and references to unistd.h are almost certainly wrong
It implies that something is not picking up the platform correctly; or just isn't designed to build on Windows at all
we also have <#C5XHHMXHB|os_windows> and someone may know there, or maybe a linux VM would be easier at this point ¯\_(?)_/¯
ugh, looks like pyconfig.h is usually output by the configure script... so who knows what state it might be in when a Windows compiler gets hold of it
yeah i believe that is one of the problems
read in another thread that windows has a tendency to mishandle the script
if i put Linux Bash on Windows, am I able to set up an environment that way?
or linux VM yeah like joe suggested
why don't you skip windows entirely
and go straight to linux vm?
you've been bashing your head against this issue for, what, two days now?
I'd say you've given it an honest effort, now use something that _works_
yeah. i think im just stubborn
its a side project so im not rushed for time
but its time to admit defeat lol
if i remember correctly, there are vms that are basically terminal only right?
the VMs just run whatever image you give them, and most linux images are the full OS. why do you ask?
You could do `vagrant`
Pretty easy to set up and reproduce your dev env that way
i was just thinking of minimalistic options
but i guess i'd like IDEs and guis and such
hello
anyone know regex that find url link with specific type eg:<http://eg.com/asd.pdf>
type of what?
what is specific about that that you need to match?
specific extension
like .pdf
.mp4
Are you more concerned with the extension itself or what kind of file it is?
Because you can get a lot from the `Content-Type` header when you make a request to it
Unless you only have strings that are the URLs
And if you go that route the `mimetypes` module can guess and extension from that
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/master/free-programming-books.md>
im trying to get only pdf link
im already used mimetypes but its iterates all link,all i want is find url with .pdf extension then download it
So only save the ones with the correct mimetype. <@U0LSCQQNR> if I'm missing anything feel free to step in this is more your wheelhouse
yea correct
install <https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/> and beautiful soup
and requests
use requests to get that link you posted above, put it into python-markdown to convert to html
Yes thank you I'm on my phone and scraping is a lot to type
then use beautifulsoup to extract all `&lt;a&gt;` tags ending in `.pdf`
that'll give you a list of URLs
you can then use `requests` to get the content of each link, then use basic python file IO to write the response data to a file on your machine
a possibly simpler version would be to get the text content of that link
split each line by `(`, and check if each result ends in .pdf
but not sure how accurate it would be, since there are different ways a `(` can appear in markdown
ok, i'll try the first solution
thanks you very much
good luck
going through the jquery tutorial, and i'm a bit confused about this lesson: <http://try.jquery.com/levels/2/challenges/4>
when switching between the descendant and direct child selectors, i don't see a difference between the two on the html
as in, the same bit of code is being highlighted regardless of which one i choose
if that's the point, then ignore this, but i was under the impression that it would highlight a smaller subset of the code
Here is my solution for <http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html>
4) Open to any suggestions on how to improve/optimize that code.
Good day Pythonist, does anyone can help me about my django template varaible {{SITE_NAME}} because i can't see it from the template even in view by request.SITE_NAME
thanks in advance
Is there a generally-accepted 'best' unit-testing package? Or is it a subjective choice between nose, py.test, etc?
`pytest`!
no thinking required
What are the advantages? I'm not a big fan of the setup/teardown syntax, but I could get used to it.
really easy fixtures, parametrized tests
