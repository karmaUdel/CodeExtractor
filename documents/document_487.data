U153UK3FA : `(,,,,,,,,)` is the limit
U153UK3FA : it's also special syntax and not a definable operator
U57KYFW67 : Are there any packages which expose access to local storage?
U153UK3FA : <@U57KYFW67> <https://github.com/elm-lang/projects/blob/master/roadmap.md#where-is-the-localstorage-package>
U57KYFW67 : tyty
U2DF486HL : Hi, in my elm app I use this kind of Routes "/#/myroute". Can I start my app with one of this routes?Bear in mind that my app entrypoint is a url like "/pathto/elmView/" in django, from where I take some flags for initialization

U1ZFF0E5P : you want to use a program from the Navigation package
U1ZFF0E5P : `import Navigation exposing (program)`
U1ZFF0E5P : this way the "current" location is sent to your init: `init : Location -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)`
U2DF486HL : <@U1ZFF0E5P> I already using something like thismain : Program Flags Model Msg
main =
    Navigation.programWithFlags OnLocationChange
        { init = init
        , view = view
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = (\model -&gt; Sub.none)
        }

U1ZFF0E5P : I do this: ```init : Location -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)init location =

    update (UrlChange location) initialModel```

U2DF486HL : and my initinit : Flags -&gt; Location -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init flags location =

U2DF486HL : But I think I'm not using in the right way the Location param then.
U1ZFF0E5P : where exactly are you hitting an issue? it compiles but doesnt behave as expected?
U1ZFF0E5P : what is the body of your init function?
U4JT89FGB : <@U3LUC6SNS> <https://gist.github.com/zgohr/265123ae03c909f466d1a8960958b890> it's very paired back to the essentials. let me know if you have any q's!
U2DF486HL : <@U1ZFF0E5P> yes, it compiles, but let me check because the initialModel always is taking the same page
U3LUC6SNS : <@U4JT89FGB> Thanks very much.  It looks quite clear - I will see if I can integrate this into my app this week.
U5WD40ZA9 : I just tried to make my first port which takes 3 arguments, this gives me a compile error but if I instead remove 2 of the parameters so there is only one it seems to compile. It also works making everything to a record, what am I missing?
U3SJEDR96 : You're not really missing anything; ports can only take a single parameter
U5WD40ZA9 : <@U3SJEDR96> So basicly the solution if I want to send more parameters is that I send a record?
U3SJEDR96 : Yep. Or you encode your data using `Json.Encode` functions to create a JS object, and make your port accept a `Json.Encode.Value`
U3SJEDR96 : btw, tuple should also work (and translates to an array on the JS side of things)
U3SJEDR96 : you can find an overview here: <https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html#customs-and-border-protection>
U5WD40ZA9 : <@U3SJEDR96> my hero! Thank you :happypanda:
U69JKF6EN : Do you guys recommend ELM native UI for a production app?
U57KYFW67 : What a greeting ^^;;
U57KYFW67 : <@U69JKF6EN> It depends on the details, I'd say.
U69JKF6EN : A lite clone of Uber.
U57KYFW67 : Other people would know better, but it's robust enough to get the job done. But the language is not stable yet, so you might have to keep closer track of the changes to the language as it develops
U3SJEDR96 : <https://robots.thoughtbot.com/elm-native-ui-in-production>
U3SJEDR96 : they did it, might be interesting to read their opinion :slightly_smiling_face:
U69JKF6EN : <@U3SJEDR96> I read that post. the elm-native-ui github page says it's not production ready. That's why I asked the question here.
U3SJEDR96 : I don't think anyone here is going to recommend using it in production, in the <#C192T0Q1E|beginners> channel, while the project itself states it is not ready for production :slightly_smiling_face:
U69JKF6EN : Thank You <@U3SJEDR96> , <@U57KYFW67> and everyone!
U4872964V : I would probably use react native still
U4872964V : but it's interesting to experiment
U5R6L5MT4 : I am building a sudoku resolver
U5R6L5MT4 : And I have a 4 functions that handle an Array Cell of 9 cells
U5R6L5MT4 : isValid : Array Cell -&gt; Bool
U5R6L5MT4 : getColumn : Int -&gt; Sudoku -&gt; Array Cell
U5R6L5MT4 : getSquare : Int -&gt; Sudoku -&gt; Array Cell
U5R6L5MT4 : getLine : Int -&gt; Sudoku -&gt; Array Cell
U5R6L5MT4 : How can I be more precise about the types
U5R6L5MT4 : And explcitely say that ArrayCell is a 9 cells array ?
U1P6FFJ64 : <@U5R6L5MT4>, you can create your own custom type that limits the amount of items of the array to 9. You will also have to reimplement some of the functions of the array module
U57KYFW67 : <@U5R6L5MT4> There's no good way to enforce the size of an array or list in Elm.
U57KYFW67 : `Array (Array Int)` is probably the best way to do it.
U3SJEDR96 : hah, I also made a sudoku solver in Elm; it's fun.
U57KYFW67 : Solving a sudoku puzzle requires a backtracking algorithm, right?
U3SJEDR96 : <https://github.com/zwilias/sudoku-solver> if you want to compare how I went about it
U3SJEDR96 : The naive algos do, not sure if there is a way to do it without backtracking at all. I suppose you do be smart about it, and check for cells that can only have one possible input, and work your way through it that way.
U57KYFW67 : I remember I gave it a try once and it could solve simple puzzles only.
U57KYFW67 : It would explain my frustration whenever I try to do one :slightly_smiling_face:
U5WD40ZA9 : I want to use a javascript lib for rendering a graph. My thought was to create the div that the library needs to render itself within and then simple load the javascript library with data provided from elm, through a port. However, since the div changes and the content within changes elm obviously doesn't recognise this when I swap page back and forth. This results in me rendering another graph, and another graph and so on every time I swap page. What is the way to go here?
U4RR7KX45 : how can I `elm-format` automatically in `vim`?
U3SJEDR96 : You can use `Html.Keyed` to ensure the vdom-diffing doesn't attempt to re-use that div. That would only work if that div stays at a similar place in the tree, though
U4RR7KX45 : is there such thing at all?
U57KYFW67 : <@U4RR7KX45> I use elm-format in vim. You've followed the install instructions already, I take it?
U3SJEDR96 : <https://github.com/avh4/elm-format/#elm-vim-installation> there is :slightly_smiling_face:
U4RR7KX45 : yes I have
U57KYFW67 : Is it not working? Or are you trying to configure it differently than the default?
U4RR7KX45 : does it have to be neovim or smth similar? I'm using vim8 at the moment
U57KYFW67 : Is vim8 the "default" vim?
U4RR7KX45 : yeah
U57KYFW67 : Yeah. I just use whatever ubuntu gave me
U4RR7KX45 : ok thanks, I'll try to uninstall plugins and re-install them
U57KYFW67 : ```call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
  Plug 'elmcast/elm-vim'
call plug#end()
```

U57KYFW67 : This is all it took me
U57KYFW67 : which is just in the instructions on that github page, of course
U1P6FFJ64 : <@U4RR7KX45> there is a <#C0SR8T090|vim> channel too where you can ask
U57KYFW67 : Don't forget to run `:PlugInstall`
U4RR7KX45 : thanks guys :slightly_smiling_face:
U4RR7KX45 : thanks Elmers :slightly_smiling_face:
U4RR7KX45 : lol
U57KYFW67 : and to set the autosave flag: let g:elm_format_autosave = 1
U57KYFW67 : Although the autosave command started screwing with me when I was trying to make changes to other people's repos (which aren't yet formatted by elm-format). I bound a key to do the format for me
