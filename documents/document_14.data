(defrecord Lol [])```
<@U5ZAJ15P0> I'm planning to learn Erlang too. Well, ok, I'll probably learn Elixir instead, but that's derived from Erlang.
Is there a way to circumvent this?
<@U06CM8C3V> yes Elixir looks interesting!
<@U04V70XH6> : is it public if your team uses GAE or AWS ?
hrm, having hard time trying to teach eastwood to ignore defrecord
