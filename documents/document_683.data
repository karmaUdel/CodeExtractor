<@U5ZPMJA06>  thanks i got it :smile:
How to do that ?
crontab?
but I need to restart script every two hours because API security keys expires after two hours, and then I need to again generate that key
ok
then so have your script execute
and then use crontab to execute it from the OS every two hours
that would be the easiest way to do it
yes, script is execute but I wish to restart itself scipt if posible :slightly_smiling_face:
