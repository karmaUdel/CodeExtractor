U3C1KGJDD : Hi. I need to wrap my storage function into a promise for use with a middleware. I'm using the cool botkit-storage-mongo module. Have very limited understanding of promises, if anyone could help with that? this is my simplified storage function
U3C1KGJDD : module.exports = {// with Callback
toDatabase: function(key, value, response) {
    controller.storage.users.get(response.user, function(err, user) {
        if (!user) {
            user = {
                id: response.user,
            };
        }
        user[key] = value;
        controller.storage.users.save(user, function(err, id) {
        });
    });
}
};

U0E9LFL3F : <@U3FGRUSLT> <@U3EFK8UES> strange cause new Date().getTime() now returns 1483891366599 which has 3 chars more. Anyway I just think my issue is that new Date(1483891366599) returns an invalid date, I am not really familiar with JS date. Maybe I'll switch to moment
U3MG94ZJP : Just created my first bot with Botkit , my problem is that near the bot user i have the word “BOT” twice , i am working with the EVENTS_API and not opening any RTM connection.. can anyone help understand why this problem can happen?
U3FGRUSLT : yeah / 1000 to get back to seconds
U3FGRUSLT : js is giving time in different units
U3FGRUSLT : ```irb(main):003:0&gt; 1483894941440/1000=&gt; 1483894941```

U3FGRUSLT : or multiple the full value slack gives by 1000
U3FGRUSLT : ```irb(main):007:0&gt; 1483895037.1102788 * 1000=&gt; 1483895037110.2788```

U0E9LFL3F : ok now makes sense
U0E9LFL3F : multiply by 1000 and then both new Date(ts) and moment(ts) works properly
U3FGRUSLT : don't even get me started about timezones and utc 24 :slightly_smiling_face: I changed all my clocks to be utc 24 so time for me is always a number from 0 to 23
U3EFK8UES : Hey there, so let's say I open a DM channel and get the channel id, and the use closed it or I try to use it days later and it's closed, and I try to use it, will it just reopen the channel? 
U3EFK8UES : I'm trying to minimize api calls 
U3EFK8UES : *user closed it, not use close it 
U3FGRUSLT : yes D3MJKEHEB or whatever the id is
U3FGRUSLT : is a link between the two users
U3FGRUSLT : send a message to that "channel" and it re-opens the DM
U3EFK8UES : Awesome! 
U3EFK8UES : Thanks, for anybody who's interested I'm storing the channel in a sqlite db, so that only call the api once
But I'm sure most people have already though of that

U3N3DR3ME : wow... lot of channels here. Apologies if i ask the right question, in the wrong room on occasion! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
U3LQGKTR6 : added an integration to this channel: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/services/B3NSUAPKP|outgoing-webhook>
U3LQGKTR6 : removed an integration from this channel: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/services/B3NSUAPKP|outgoing-webhook>
U34F4FH7U : I'm working on putting together a slack command
U34F4FH7U : I've got oauth verifying correctly, but can't seem to figure out how to access the users list via the command
U34F4FH7U : looks like my two scopes are identify &amp; commands
U34F4FH7U : when I try to get the user list it complains about "missing_scope"
U34F4FH7U : ahh... I think I understand now.  I was thinking it wanted me to provide the scope with my request, but it's probably that I didn't request the correct scope when I authed, isn't it?
U34F4FH7U : there needs to be a rubber duck emoji
U3N8DHUDN : Hi there, I just joined this slack team so sorry if I am asking this in the wrong channel
I am working on an slack app that prints buttons. That part works but when I click the button I got a message saying 
```Darn – that didn't work (error message: `No error`). Manage the app at name_of_my_app```

This message is not very useful. Do you know where I can get more info or why I this message is being printed?
Thank you guys!!

U0GT29N3A : <@U3N8DHUDN> Did you configure your Interactive Messages callback URL?
U3N8DHUDN : Hi <@U0GT29N3A>. Yes I did and I can see how it is not being called
U3N8DHUDN : Is there a way where I can see what my button is sending every time I click it? The ‘No error' message does not help me too much
U0GT29N3A : You can check what it _should_ send in the docs, or check your server logs (but the latter won't help much if you didn't receive the request at all).
U3FGRUSLT : we are starting a new class <http://losangeles.craigslist.org/wst/eng/5951261475.html> if anyone here wants to take our program for free.
U3PCMK1AA : Hi all, I've been playing with integrating slack different ways but now that I want to use the events api in a bot, the doc is really confusing me. If I get it right, to use the event api, I need to create a slack app to use my bot in it. The first step is to go through the url verification process, this has been done successfully. Now, the oauth flow. That's where I'm stuck. I don't want to distribute my app, which means my slack app, my bot and my users are all in the same team. If they are on slack, they are authenticated. Any hints and pointers? thanks in advance
U04SM6T2H : you need to use oauth to grant your app permission to your team
U04SM6T2H : once you do it, you can disable your oauth endpoints to prevent others from signing in
U3PCMK1AA : I'll try that, thanks <@U04SM6T2H> . So even if the app is created from a team's account, it actually does not have permission.
