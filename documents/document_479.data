True : Bool```
I want it to be false since I have letters
I think you want match instead of contains
and you will have to put start of line and end of line patterns on there
nvm contains is the correct function
but you want to so a full string match
for posix that would be a `^` at the beginning and a `$` at the end
not sure what the JS flavour is
looks like it's the same
`Regex.contains (Regex.regex "^(\\[0-9]|-)*$")`
Yeah what he said :+1:
