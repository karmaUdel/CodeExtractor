Anyone up?
Yup.
Could you try to answer me a question please?
Yes if it is related to python.

I'm currently learning how to use modules and call other files. It's is possible to have a file named(main.py) and call another file(ship.py). And from ship.py execute a function in main.py Sorry if I'm not explaining clear enough.
From the function main.py I want to execute some code of the file ship.py and also I want to do it the other way, from ship.py I want to execute functions of main.py
<@U67NP4A0K> this is called a 'circular import', and that's generally prohibited
Oh
`main.py` sounds like an entry point, why would you import something from it?
I'll search about it
