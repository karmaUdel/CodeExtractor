U596L3LCV : <@U1NSCAY6R> I'm not using any particular framework at this point. Right now I'm just trying to find any possible way to implement that.
U1NSCAY6R : It's going to depend on those factors, so before being able to share content, you'll first need a way to create, store, retrieve, and show content to like and/or share
U5RJNFFGX : <@U29163YQH> damn :disappointed:
U64MJCDNH : Hi folks, I ask yet but I can't find resolution. Some advice I need. I have script with some export of data which collecting data over API. To work correctly over API I must to get some seurity key over API, that key expires after 2 hours. That script open HTTP server and listen on some address. Because is work as server I have```while True:
            time.sleep(15)

               collecting data command
                collecting data command````
But after 2 hours I need to start function to collect new API secure key.
How to resolve that ?
I tryed to add variable ```wakeup = time.time()``` and to add in while loop 
```if wakeup - time.time() &gt; 7200:
              api_key()```
but I understand that can't work on this way. :disappointed:

U5LNXQHN3 : <@U64MJCDNH>  That last way will work, if you do the expression the right way around
U5LNXQHN3 : `time_elapsed = time.time() - start_time`
U5LNXQHN3 : another way is just to wrap your usual requests in a function that will request the new API key and re-request if necessary
U64MJCDNH : <@U5LNXQHN3> How to integrate that in```while True:
        time.sleep(15)```

The best way is to restart whole script after 2 hours, but I don't want to use cron.
Do you have some idea ?

U5LNXQHN3 : wrap that script in another script that re-runs it until it's killed?
U5LNXQHN3 : and just have the inner script quit out after 2 hours. Although I don't see why you need to restart the script
U64MJCDNH : How to integrate ```time_elapsed = time.time() - start_time``` in my while loop ?
U5LNXQHN3 : How do you think? That tells you how long has passed. When a certain time has passed, you'll want to break out of the loop (if you want to restart the script), or get a new token/key (if you don't)
U64MJCDNH : sorry I'm newbie in python. Can I add this in while loope whith if, and when certain time has passed to call my function for new key ?
U5LNXQHN3 : Before the loop, when you get the token for the first time: `start_time = time.time()`
U5LNXQHN3 : And in the loop, before each request:```
if time.time() - start_time &gt;= 7200:
    api_key()
```

U5LNXQHN3 : You'll probably want a value lower than 7200 anyway, because waiting until the last second means you might get a failed request at the end
U64MJCDNH : kylotan, thank you.
U5LNXQHN3 : (also, test it with a number like 60, so you don't have to wait 2 hours to see if it's correct or not!)
U5LNXQHN3 : No problem.
U5CGPBF0U : So, configuring a Python app to use gunicorn on Heroku, the docs show `web: gunicorn hello:app` for the example Procfile but doesn't really explain what `hello:app` represents. Is it `&lt;class&gt;:&lt;method&gt;` or something like that?
U64MJCDNH : <@U5LNXQHN3> Of course. Thank's :wink:
U0L8Y8ZEW : <@U5CGPBF0U> I'm guessing it is probably module:function
U64MJCDNH : <@U5LNXQHN3> Do you have some idea ?I added start_time variable before loop, and added this in loop. My loop now looks:
```while True:
        if time.time() - start_time &gt;= 60:
            get_key()

        time.sleep(15)```
When I start script, after 60 seconds scripts run get_key function what is good, but then on after each 15 second again.

U5LNXQHN3 : ah, of course. you'll need to reset start_time to time.time whenever you get a new key.
