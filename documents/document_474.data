U3LUC6SNS : It still has the ../src that I tried.
U0FP80EKB : This is the one in `tests` ?
U0FP80EKB : I'm assuming that the modules are in `../src`
U0FP80EKB : Can you paste the package json from the root? non-tests?
U3LUC6SNS : Yes.  Normally it says ```
"source-directories": [
        "src"
    ],
```
All of my Elm files except tests are in `src`

U3LUC6SNS : And the app compiles, which is one check
U0FP80EKB : Hmm…. And you are running `elm-test` from within `tests` (sorry for the basic questions)
U0FP80EKB : (just going over some of the things I've accidentally done)
U3LUC6SNS : Just to be sure: `jxxmbp:koko_client carlson$ diff elm-package.json tests/elm-package.json `
No problem about the questions.  I've always run tests from the root directory.  If I do so from `tests`, I get this:
```
jxxmbp:tests carlson$ elm-test
No tests found in the test/ (or tests/) directory.

NOTE: Make sure you're running elm-test from your project's root directory, where its elm-package.json lives.
```

U0FP80EKB : oh, interesting. I wonder if I do, as well.
U3SQ42JJW : Hey everyone. I try to figure out a way to achieve the following:I have a List of Poll. And I want to convert it to a List of RawItem where every RawItem contains the elements of PollItem plus the tstamp of the parent Poll

```
type alias Poll =
    { tstamp : Int
    , questionnaire : List PollItem
    }


type alias PollItem =
    { questionType : String
    , question : String
    , answer : String
    }
```


into this:
```
type alias RawItem =
    { tstamp : Int
    , questionType : String
    , question : String
    , answer : String
    }
```

U3SQ42JJW : any ideas ?
U0FP80EKB : <@U3LUC6SNS> Hmm… I'm out of ideas. Sorry.
U3SQ42JJW : I tried to achieve that with nested List.map … but couldnt find a way how to transfer the tstamp into the deeper List.map
U3LUC6SNS : No problem -- I appreciate the effort.  Will sort it out tomorrow
U4872964V : <@U3SQ42JJW> make a function like this:```
makeRawItem : Int -&gt; PollItem -&gt; RawItem
```
and then
```
List.map (makeRawItem poll.tstamp) poll.questionnaire
```

U4F64AKQV : <@U3SQ42JJW> break it up into two steps. Have one step that converts a single Poll to a list of RawItems. Then use concatMap or something like that to repeat that for all of them. 
U3LUC6SNS : <@U0FP80EKB> I brought out the nuclear weapon: `elm-test init` in the root directory.  this fixed things (and did not nuke my test file). Go figure!
U0FP80EKB : haha! That works.
U3LUC6SNS : Ha ha indeed!  Like rebooting the computer to solve 99% of mysterious problems.
U3SQ42JJW : :smile: Thanks <@U4F64AKQV> <@U4872964V> and <@U3FJSB596> … ah I am still not functional… a partial applicated function like Martin showed did solve that. … Still have to learn… :wink:
U4F64AKQV : It takes some time to get used to, but once you start to recognize the patterns it becomes really easy (even easier than imperative in my opinion)
U601ELFEG : anyone got a good example of a module that needs to do several round trips through a `Cmd` and a `Sub` to get something done... and then offers essentially a `Cmd` and `Sub` like interface back to other (higher up) client modules?
U2GPAEU1L : <@U3SQ42JJW> I just made a tutorial on what it means to have a language use currying by default: <http://codetidbit.com/#view/snipbit/596930d17890d775c05191f3/introduction>
If anyone else is *struggling with currying*, perhaps that tutorial will help you!

Cheers :smile:
