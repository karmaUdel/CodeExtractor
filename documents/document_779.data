U0EUHKVGB : <@U2LAL86AY>, hey, if you've written something up then please put it in a gist.
U0EUHKVGB : Long form posts like that are not well suited to Slack.
U0EUHKVGB : It makes it very hard to give feedback to you.
U2LAL86AY : yep i created that repo
U2LAL86AY : will make a gist soon
U0EUHKVGB : That repo is fine, I didn't click on it yet cause I was still reading your post :wink:
U2LAL86AY : ah and i forgot to mention - when calling the same function multiple times in the same update step - clicking on it in the second pannel - will show every instance of it's calling in order. So nothing is hidden
U170TNSTZ : Anyone using IntelliJ? Am I assuming correctly that it does not support showing type errors (eg missing cases), only syntax errors?
U2LAL86AY : i need to go because here is late - regarding my request, please leave your feedback here instead of slack: <https://github.com/AionDev/xray-time-traveling-debugger/issues/1>]

U4872964V : <@U2LAL86AY> will read it tomorrow! interesting
U2U94G0QG : <@U2SR9DL7Q> I was catching up on unread history yesterday and saw your convo. about shuffling - it reminded me of this which is my current fav way to do that:```
shuffle : List comparable -&gt; List a -&gt; List a
shuffle random list =
    List.map2 (,) list random
        |&gt; List.sortBy Tuple.second
        |&gt; List.unzip
        |&gt; Tuple.first
```

U2SR9DL7Q : <@U2U94G0QG> First off, I'm just pleased that I've reached the level where I can understand what that does. This implementation is pretty neat.
U2U94G0QG : credit where it's due - it came from a tutorial I ran through a while back so it's not mine
U2U94G0QG : but I love when Elm code reads like this
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U2U94G0QG> I just ended up using the `Random.shuffle` function in the random extra library. This function seems way less messy than that one. I have completely fallen in love with the `|&gt;` operator.
U2SR9DL7Q : today I ended up converting
U2U94G0QG : haha very nice
U2SR9DL7Q : whoops... tried to make it smaller. But I think you saw it
U2U94G0QG : you can add it as a reply to one of our messages to put it in a thread so it doesn't spam the channel
U2U94G0QG : (for future ref)

U2SR9DL7Q : The day the pipe structure clicked my life changed forever
U2SR9DL7Q : also, my update Msgs are way more sane.
U2U94G0QG : same, I wonder how I lived without it
U2U94G0QG : currently trying to sell my team on the benefits of Elm
U2SR9DL7Q : I'm trying to do the same thing I did here with the calculations for the AI player, but it's trickier
U2SR9DL7Q : My old boss would never have let me elm if I just asked. But if I'd built something awesome with it first and showed her the no runtime error thing... she'd probably get on board.
U2U94G0QG : I'm building a little thing to show off, it's still early but I have gotten some positive feedback already - we just shipped a React/Redux app and are now planning what will be used in a rewrite of an old flash app
U2U94G0QG : it looks like it will be about the same + TypeScript, but I want to use Elm :smile:
U2SR9DL7Q : i'm avoiding everything 'script'
