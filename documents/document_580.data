U6FK062M7 : not sure where I am going wrong since it looks fairly similar to the tutorial
U23SA861Y : This is the line between what your webserver is set up to do, and what your app is setup to do.
U6FK062M7 : *facepalm* now I understand all that stuff about hash url, oh boy.
U6FK062M7 : okay, never mind
U6FK062M7 : sometimes it helps just to explain
U23SA861Y : you can certainly setup your webserver to help you here
U23SA861Y : but yeah, the hash allows you to have this sort of local path on top of the main server route
U3HQVHERX : does anybody have experience with webpack in here? is this the right place to ask?
U3HQVHERX : I'm following this tutorial: <https://elmseeds.thaterikperson.com/elm-webpack-extras>
U3HQVHERX : ```WARNING in ./src/Main.elm
(Emitted value instead of an instance of Error) Unknown Elm compiler option: debug
 @ ./public/js/app.js 1:0-36
```

U3HQVHERX : ```"devDependencies": {
    "elm-hot-loader": "^0.5.4",
    "elm-webpack-loader": "^4.3.1",
    "webpack": "^3.4.1",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^2.6.1"
  }
```

U6ECA0Q4D : What does the ! operator do?   I've been reading through the elm-datepicker code and came across some lines that look like this: ```prepareDates (prevMonth currentMonth) model ! []```
U3HQVHERX : <@U6ECA0Q4D> it's short hand for `(model, Cmd.none)` ... it makes a tuple
U3HQVHERX : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Platform-Cmd#>!
U6ECA0Q4D : So what is valid in the array?  Just commands?
U3HQVHERX : `List (Cmd msg)`
U6ECA0Q4D : Ah, that's where it is in the docs!  I couldn't find it.  Thanks!
U3HQVHERX : yeah.. searching for infix operators is weird i googled `elm "! []"` to find that
U6ECA0Q4D : Thanks for the help <@U3HQVHERX>.  I'm trying to wrap my head around the elm architecture and functional programming and it's kicking my butt
U3HQVHERX : <@U6ECA0Q4D> no problem! it's worth the effort. my advice: use the `elm-repl` as a sandbox to learn features of the language and use <https://ellie-app.com/new> for small case studies
U2XRG0UKA : <@U3HQVHERX> what does your Webpack config file look like?
