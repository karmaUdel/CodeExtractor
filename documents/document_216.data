U2ZDLHVQD : has anyone run into good platforms that do Sentiment Analysis?
U3LDUPV2A : the microsoft one is pretty easy to use...
U3LDUPV2A : you can play with a smple version online.  here.  I threw a bunch of tripadvisor reviews at it, and it did a pretty good job at returning accurate results <https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/text-analytics-api>
U3EFK8UES : Kinda iffy
U3EFK8UES : I took the default of:
U3EFK8UES : ```I had a wonderful experience! The rooms were wonderful and the staff were helpful.```
U3EFK8UES : It returend a 98
U3EFK8UES : Changed it to
U3EFK8UES : ```I had a wonderful experience! The rooms were *somewhat* wonderful and the staff were helpful.```
U3EFK8UES : and
U3EFK8UES : ```I had a wonderful experience! The rooms were wonderful and the staff were *somewhat* helpful.```
U3EFK8UES : Same percentage on all 3
U3LDUPV2A : interesting… did it pickup on somewhat as a key phrase?
U3EFK8UES : Nope
U3EFK8UES : Hrm, it picks up on Kind of
U3EFK8UES : but doesn't reduce the percent
U3LDUPV2A : i see… in many contexts *somewhat* would probably be a useless word… in this context, it's definitely adding something.
U3EFK8UES : ```I had a wonderful experience! The rooms were wonderful and the staff were kind of helpful.```
U3LDUPV2A : have you used another service that deals with this scenario better?
U3EFK8UES : Oh no
U3EFK8UES : Just looking at this :confused:
U3EFK8UES : lol
U3EFK8UES : This is definatyely better than nothing
U3EFK8UES : thats for sure
U3LDUPV2A : haha.. yeah - for most things (like what I'm looking to build), I think it'd be adequate.  I can deal with a false/positive error rate of 10-20%
U3EFK8UES : Indeed :stuck_out_tongue:
U3LDUPV2A : Planning to pay with Amazon Lex in then next week or two… but lex seems like it requries a little more setup to get going then MS. <https://aws.amazon.com/lex/>
