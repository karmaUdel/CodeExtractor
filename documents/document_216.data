```
I tried with `Expect.all` but it does not seems to do what I want
seems like those should be multiple tests, actually?
for me it's the same test but with different data
so it's not worth having multiple tests
anyway it's working like that but I wanted to do something more "datadriven"
If you are set on doing this, however, I think you will need to roll your own helper function to handle it.
<@U48AEBJQ3> : right, but fuzzing supposes to know how to compute the result of the function you want to test and independantely of your original implementation
with fuzzing, you have no control of the data your test generates, so you cannot challenge your test function result against a predefined computation
I'm not going to argue the merits of `elm-test`, that is probably better left for <#C0CLGCMMF|testing>.
