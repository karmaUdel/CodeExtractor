U6DQCTZT2 : <@U0JFXEUCT> so you're not defining it in `Main.elm` then, since that would create a circular import? Maybe Elm doesn't struggle with that?
U0JFXEUCT : yeah, CommonMsg is in a separate file
U0JFXEUCT : and imported by Main and by the Page
U6DQCTZT2 : <@U0JFXEUCT> that's awesome :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : No, it's not strictly 32bits. It's 50-something. Under the hood, they're just JS numbers, which are all 64bit floats.
U3SJEDR96 : <@U6D3ERLA1> yeah, random is a little harder in fp because functions have to be pure - every time you call a function with the same inputs, it should return the same output without any side-effects. Things that look simple in other languages, like getting a random number or the current time, require a bit more work in Elm and other fp languages because of that. So, random gives you two options, either running a generator as a cmd, or doing manual seed management and using `step`, taking care to store the new seed in your model.
U6D3ERLA1 : this has led me down the ports rabbit-hole
U3SJEDR96 : Ports? What for?
U6D3ERLA1 : well, I'll need this anyway...
U6D3ERLA1 : trying to do something like:
U6D3ERLA1 : ```        var app = Elm.Main.embed(document.body)

        app.ports.fromElm.handle( function (params, callback) {
            callback(null, Math.random());
        })
```

U6D3ERLA1 : no worky
U6D3ERLA1 : unable to get js values into my elm app
U3SJEDR96 : So, you can do basically that but using `Random.generate`, without using ports
U3SJEDR96 : as for the ports syntax, it's `app.ports.fromElm.subscribe(function (arg) { * do something with arg. There is no callback, tho, but you can app.ports.toElm.send(..) it back in * }`
U3SJEDR96 : ports are always async and always "decoupled". It's not two way traffic. It's basically a remote API that you send stuff to, and that may send stuff to you
U6D3ERLA1 : <@U3SJEDR96> How do I read the sent value `app.ports.toElm.send(..)`
U3SJEDR96 : quicky using `Random.generate` <https://ellie-app.com/3SYQyLhXzmha1/0>
U3SJEDR96 : you'd have a `port toElm : (String -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg` for example, which would allow sending in a  string. You also have to hook that up to your `main` program using `subscriptions`. I'd advice going through the guide (<https://guide.elm-lang.org/>), especially the section on JS interop
U3SJEDR96 : and adapted for manual seed management, with the initial seed provided on startup through flags: <https://ellie-app.com/3SYQyLhXzmha1/1>
U3SJEDR96 : Note that random generators can be combined using `map`, `andThen` and related functionality to create pretty powerful generators, that make "now give me a random battleship board" completely feasible and calling that would be no more complex than getting a single random number.
U6D3ERLA1 : If I could get a single random number I'd be good
U6D3ERLA1 : `Random.step (<http://Random.int|Random.int> 0 100) (Random.initialSeed 0)`
U3SJEDR96 : It will be random, but it will be the same sequence every time you run your application.
U3SJEDR96 : Well, actually, if you don't save the resulting seed anywhere, you'll just get the same value every time
U6D3ERLA1 : Yes
U3SJEDR96 : So that might as well just say `25`
U6D3ERLA1 : yes
U6D3ERLA1 : Another question...
U6D3ERLA1 : why does this not work in repl?
U6D3ERLA1 : $ list = (1,2,3,4)
U6D3ERLA1 : $ (a,b) = list
U6D3ERLA1 : ```
5|   a$b$z
     ^^^
Maybe you want one of the following?

    !
    %
    *
    +

```

U3SJEDR96 : heh, yeah, destructuring doesn't work in the repl apparently. Note that you'd need `(a, b, c, d)` in regular code to match on a 4-tuple, but yeah, that's pretty weird nevertheless
U6D3ERLA1 : ok
U3SJEDR96 : I surmise it does some weird manipulation with the lefthand side variable you try to assign to, so it can keep track of it and print its value and whatnot, and that this fails
U3SJEDR96 : (same with `{ foo, bar } = { foo = "Foo", bar = "bar" }` btw. I'll see if there's a bug for that and log one if there isn't)
U24HQ3RJ7 : i am using it inline.
U3SJEDR96 : Using `Css.compile`? Did the record that is returned by that contain any warnings/errors?
U24HQ3RJ7 : <@U3SJEDR96> is that comment for me. ?no, i am not using Css.compile..
please see <https://github.com/ashishnegi/be_autonomous/blob/master/Quadrant/View.elm>
and <https://github.com/ashishnegi/be_autonomous/blob/master/MyCss.elm>

U24HQ3RJ7 : if i use it inline.. do i need to call Css.compile ?
U3SJEDR96 : That was indeed a comment to you :slightly_smiling_face: So you need to compile the styles in `MyCss.elm` to a stylesheet,  have a read through this part of the readme: <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-css/tree/9.1.0#approach-2-generating-css-files>
