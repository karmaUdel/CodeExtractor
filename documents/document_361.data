how is `spaces` defined?
Shouldn't that be `"a b \\n"` :thinking_face: err. I mean. This seems like an escaping issue?
no, `\n` can be used like that
my guess is that `spaces` also is a `zeroOrMore`; which means `word` would _always_  match, and since it's ina repeat, it would keep on going without progressing
hence, a badrepeat
<@U3SJEDR96>, that (keep on going) sounds right.  I will give it more thought.
Thought on the word parser.
so basically, I'd say a word cannot be empty, but `words` can have an empty list of words
i.e. flip the `orMore`'s around
also, <@U3LUC6SNS> - check that condition - either `not (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\\')` or `c /= ' ' &amp;&amp; c /= '\n' &amp;&amp; c/= '\\'`, methinks

I was wondering if there is any reason why commands send via ports are excluded from the time travel debugger and interaction with the interface of web-components is not. If I am right, the current explanation for excluding ports is that Elm is not aware of the JavaScript that is executed outside the Elm-world. But doesn't this exact reason also apply to web-components?
I'm not sure I follow? Incoming messages appear in the time-travel debugger, outgoing messages don't
or rather, outgoing commands
So by my understanding, it's not that ports are excluded, it's simply that they don't get special treatment and hence, commands being sent to ports don't appear, just like outgoing webrequests or tasks being performed don't appear
