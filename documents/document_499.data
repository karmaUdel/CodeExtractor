How does your view look?
in terms of types of the generic thingy
I have no idea yet, could be just an overlay on top of everything if there is something to confirm.
I would check if there is smth to confirm, then show the overlay on top of the content with Yes and No buttons
Why do you want to store the message in the model?
Why not just trigger it when the confirm button is clicked?
Because then I could reuse this for any confirmation, and I would just have to change `onClick Whatever` to `onClick (Confirm Whatever)`.
