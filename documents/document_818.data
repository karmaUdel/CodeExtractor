U5SQYT750 : you can use ```which python``` to check which one you are using
U0NRYQNAZ : but i think the issue is with the library <@U5SQYT750>, :re <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1497625527626658>
U3QVAJ5QV : 3 ... and (maybe this is just a dumb question) but I was worried that installing using conda to install virtual env is not what I wanted.
U5SQYT750 : but as <@U0NRYQNAZ> said, probably best to not try and mix them up
U5SQYT750 : Oh, hadn't seen zappa before
U0NRYQNAZ : when you do `which python` what comes up?
U3QVAJ5QV : Normally the conda one.
U0NRYQNAZ : that's where we would run into our first issue. we wouldn't want to be using the conda one. we would want something like the system python, i believe.
U3QVAJ5QV : Right... thus my question :slightly_smiling_face:
U3QVAJ5QV : Seems like I need to be able to deactivate conda and ‘activate' python3 (sytem would be python2) and then use virtual env.  Thanks for getting me started on the right track.
U5SQYT750 : when you create the environment, you can specify something like: ``` virtualenv envname --python='path/to/python'```
U5SQYT750 : if that helps
U3QVAJ5QV : Yes, thanks <@U5SQYT750>
U5SQYT750 : then follow <@U0NRYQNAZ> advice on activating
U3QVAJ5QV : conda sets the path to point to its bin directory ... so I may need a way to not do that when trying to do virtualenv/zapp stuff ... before I can activate the zappa env (if I understand this correctly).
U5SQYT750 : related to this? <https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/issues/167>
U3QVAJ5QV : Yes. I just wanted to explore Zappa without having any conda/virtualenv issues. Don't need conda for this so wanted to switch to using virtualenv and wasn't sure how to do it. I think I have a strategy now.  Thanks everyone.
U1ENC5QCQ : heya
U0NRYQNAZ : sup <@U1ENC5QCQ>
U0NRYQNAZ : how's the masters program going?
U1ENC5QCQ : oh I am done
U0NRYQNAZ : nice!
U1ENC5QCQ : graduate a month ago
U0NRYQNAZ : congrats!
U1ENC5QCQ : so now I got time for python meetups
U1ENC5QCQ : thansk <@U0NRYQNAZ>
U0NRYQNAZ : haha.. cool :thumbsup:
U1ENC5QCQ : anything on your end
U0NRYQNAZ : same old stuff for the most part. i'm just trying to achieve perfect work/life ~balance~ harmony. lol
U1ENC5QCQ : me to
U1ENC5QCQ : I am like 75% coding
U1ENC5QCQ : if not 10 % of no coding is spent thinking of coding
U1ENC5QCQ : the rest is sleep
U1ENC5QCQ : and some netlfix
U1ENC5QCQ : 75% of coding is doing work coding
U0NRYQNAZ : that's good.
U1ENC5QCQ : I should say 50% coding 15 % work none coding
U0NRYQNAZ : python or .net?
U1ENC5QCQ : .net
U1ENC5QCQ : but some python also
U0NRYQNAZ : or both
U1ENC5QCQ : I just love both
U0NRYQNAZ : you try some iron python?
U1ENC5QCQ : I want to
U0NRYQNAZ : you doing C# or VB?
U1ENC5QCQ : I want to try WPF in iron python
U1ENC5QCQ : even if I have no need
U1ENC5QCQ : powershell and c#
U0NRYQNAZ : cool
U1ENC5QCQ : vb hell no
U0NRYQNAZ : lol
U0NRYQNAZ : i agree there. i tried to do iron python LONG time ago. i was a dba but the dev was a C# guy and he was said to have been the best in the university. the university was doing consolidation at the system level so he applied to work at our little lab basically to hide.
U0NRYQNAZ : i tried to take the opportunity to learn what i could but he ended up not being able to do much coding.
U1ENC5QCQ : anyone who uses macs
U1ENC5QCQ : this is good <https://monodraw.helftone.com/>
U1ENC5QCQ : oh wow
U0NRYQNAZ : haha that's interesting.
U1ENC5QCQ : brb
U1ENC5QCQ : do you know how to display ascii art in python
U1ENC5QCQ : is it just this longstring = """\You can use multiple lines
and newlines
are preserved
"""

U1ENC5QCQ : <@U0NRYQNAZ>  check this out <https://gist.github.com/itadder/0538cce16f1cb162c288c85c557367b7>
U1ENC5QCQ : that cool
U1ENC5QCQ : just learning more python
U1ENC5QCQ : trying to think of a project to do on the weekends that is not super hard but uses python
U1BP42MRS : If you're short on ideas, feel free to check in on the <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects>
U1ENC5QCQ : ahh thanks
U29163YQH : :smile:
U5NMSURAQ : Such a good bot.
U29163YQH : almost as if sometime he is control by a human :smile:
U5NMSURAQ : :open_mouth:
U5NMSURAQ : Wait a second.
U5NMSURAQ : So you *were* snooping on our private conversation? :flushed:
U29163YQH : I don't know what conversation but I can make <@U56EV8LAJ> say what I want
U5NMSURAQ : Oh, alright. So you can't see our convo?
U5NMSURAQ : Alright.
U5NMSURAQ : Not that I say anything bad.
U29163YQH : if <@U56EV8LAJ> is in a channel (public or private) we could snoop with the logs. In private messages <@U56EV8LAJ> doesn't see them, only when you use `/` commands
U1BP42MRS : We should probably put that in the intro doc just so we are fully transparent. I think we spoke about that before and filed an issue already
U29163YQH : slackline is also listening to stuff but only on general
U5P4JPYCU : hey guys
U5NMSURAQ : hey buddy
U5P4JPYCU : I have installed a python package with pip, made some changes on the source code, recompiled it with `python -m compileall .` but when I run package_name -arguments my changes weren't applied
U5P4JPYCU : any tips?
U5NMSURAQ : compileall?
U5P4JPYCU : yeah I did this at `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mypackage`
U5NMSURAQ : oh
U5P4JPYCU : I also removed the previous .pyc file
U5P4JPYCU : before recompiling
U5P4JPYCU : apologies if I'm asking in the wrong channel, I didn't find one for pip issues
U0NRYQNAZ : help is a good channel to ask in n/w.
U0NRYQNAZ : did you install your package with `-e`?
U0NRYQNAZ : `pip install -e "path/to/package"`
U5P4JPYCU : <@U0NRYQNAZ> no
U5P4JPYCU : just `pip install mypackage`
U0NRYQNAZ : that would be your issue
U0NRYQNAZ : -e allows it to be editable
U0NRYQNAZ : it creates symlinks to where your package exists to the site-packages dir so that you can edit the files and see the changes.
U5P4JPYCU : hmm
U5P4JPYCU : so I need to reinstall it
U0NRYQNAZ : you can install it again on top (i think).
U0NRYQNAZ : but it's probably safer to uninstall first
U5P4JPYCU : okay
U5P4JPYCU : `mypackage should either be a path to a local project or a VCS url beginning with svn+, git+, hg+, or bzr+`
U0NRYQNAZ : is it local?
U5P4JPYCU : no
U0NRYQNAZ : hmmm.. this package is on pypi?
U0NRYQNAZ : you're going to want a local copy of whatever package this is. if you are editing it and expecting to see the changes.
U0NRYQNAZ : for example lets say this is my project dir.
```
|--- requests
|--- my_awesome_app
```

U0NRYQNAZ : these are two python packages. requests has been cloned down from github but i would like to edit it separately and see the changes in `my_awesome_app`
U0NRYQNAZ : i would go into the `my_awesome_app` dir and activate the virtualenv.
U0NRYQNAZ : then type `pip install -e "../requests"`
U5P4JPYCU : virtualenv?
U5P4JPYCU : uuuh let me see if I can figure something out by cloning the repo
U0NRYQNAZ : yes, a virtualenv is short for “virtual environment” it basically makes a copy of your python binaries and places them in a separate location (again using symlinks). This separate location acts as an isolated environment in which you install dependencies/packages. What you gain from this is the ability to only have the packages and package versions you need for that particular project.
U0NRYQNAZ : if you are using python3 it comes with virtualenv capabillity
U5P4JPYCU : does `pip install` look for any particular file?
U0NRYQNAZ : pip install will be looking for a `setup.py` file in the root of the package.
