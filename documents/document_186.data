hello
Hey everyone! Dan from RadBots here, happy to join and help support however I can. :slightly_smiling_face:
Hey guys, I have a question about posting attachments to channels via a Python slackbot. What channel should I head to?
<@U3UKQCFM1> I'd try <#C0J3CL5V1|language-python>
Hey guys, when you are hosting your slack app/bot, how do you filter requests to just ones from slack IPs? As far as i can tell, slack doesn't have a list of IPs for their requests to whitelist and allow through a firewall....
or if anyone can point me to the right channel to ask that Q, that would be much appreciated :smile:
<@U3NFQN97H> I handle that via team authentication, IP addresses are not a great way to handle auth these days.  I'm sure they're hosted on some sort of elastic infrastructure.
<@U3NFQN97H> According to <https://twitter.com/slackapi/status/567110311476350976>, Slack does not have static IP addresses, so they recommend checking the token that is sent along w/ other details to verify the request is actually from Slack. Depending on whether you're app/bot is listening for a webhook or an event, the format is slightly different. See <https://api.slack.com/events-api#receiving_events> for events api, and <https://api.slack.com/outgoing-webhooks> for outgoing webhooks.
Question, anyone using AWS Lambda for hosting commands and bots for slack? I would like to know the challenges and recommendations
umeshshah Yes, I'm doing that at the moment.
is it possible to delete a channel without first archiving it?
<@U1ZMN2FD1> There is no API method to delete a channel: you can only archive I believe.
so that would also mean it can't be done via a client, right?
i'm asking because a channel disappeared from a team that has my app installed, but i didn't receive a `channel_archive` event, which i thought would be necessary before deletion
unfortunately i'm not subscribed to `channel_delete`
Hi bot builders I'm in SF from Feb 5th - 11th Anyone up for a meet to share learnings on building slack bots?
Hi, I am Rama from Palo Alto - just released a Slack bot - it is private beta. Have learned a lot from this process and would love to share what I have learned and learning from the experience. One question: What are your best tips for doing user testing with a bot? How do you do user testing without needing to get the team admin to install the bot on the team directory? Thanks!

Anyone care to weigh-in with their valued perspective?
Ideally integrated into SMS!
Um what does this have to do with bot building 
My mistake... I thought this was the Slack Developer Hangout (formerly).

Hey, just wondering, does anyone noticed an issue with message buttons not rendering on iOS in certain case with the last release ?
<@U3W32JY06> one thing we did for user testing was have a real human basically pretending to be the bot on the other side
