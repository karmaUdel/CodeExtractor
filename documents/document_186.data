U04SM6T2H : <https://api.slack.com/docs/changelog>
U04SM6T2H : official changelog finally :simple_smile:
U0HPZF95H : Yep, all things are getting better!
U0D7C5RAL : Nice. I'm rooting for an RSS-feed for it.
U0P3KKXMX : it would be neat if the bot could indicate that it is typing, like i'd send that right before a heavy db operation
U0J283T6E : Hey everyone!  We've just launched the beta of our improved search for slack
U0J283T6E : Type `/find —help` to see more
U0J283T6E : (I realise the convention is /command help, but what if you were searching for messages  with “help" in them?)
U0554MQJB : <@U0J283T6E>: -help doesn't work for me...
U0554MQJB : <@U0J283T6E>: neither does “help"
U0J283T6E : there's a double dash in there - unix convention which the slack client reformats to a unicode _emdash_.  ```/find  - - help 
/find —help```

U0J283T6E : <@U0554MQJB>: I just tried and it works for me, any joy for you?
U04SM6T2H : <@U0J283T6E>: cool!
U0J283T6E : thanks mate!
U0J283T6E : We're very interested in user feedback as we've only been testing on our own slack history so far, which is a bit limited
U0J283T6E : So please have a play let us know how you find it.  The main idea is for a more _relevant_ search experience
U0J283T6E : You can use `/find —feedback` to send comments to us anonymously
U0HBN0L9M : for me `/find -help` searches for -help
U0HBN0L9M : really cool app though
U0HBN0L9M : congrats
U0CS6NSF5 : it's a double dash, not a single one
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0J283T6E>'s autocorrect was turning - - into a long dash, the same way three consecutive dots are turned into an ellipsis
U0CS6NSF5 : they should set `/find` to return the help, instead of searching for nothing, and remove the `/find --help`
U0CS6NSF5 : if you want to try it anyway, watch out for the autocorrect when typing `/find --help` (when you type `h`) and press cmd+z to undo the autocorrection
U0HBN0L9M : yep
U0HBN0L9M : works
U0HBN0L9M : -h works too and is simpler
U0HBN0L9M : I don't have that autocorrect I think it's Mac specific
U0HBN0L9M : no Slack
U0CS6NSF5 : yep, it's mac
U0HBN0L9M : I had the annoying french quote autocorrect
U0J283T6E : Thanks <@U0CS6NSF5> that's a great suggestion
U07HXFWUD : hey there was a company making bots, one of the first slackfund investments, and they had an insanely epilepsy inducing homepage. can  anyone remember who that was? i wanted to show a designer friend…
U0PAHKVM0 : <@U07HXFWUD>: I don't know if they're one of the SlackFund companies, but I came across this yesterday and felt near-seizure. <https://www.hamsterpad.com>
U07HXFWUD : oh i was thinking of <http://awesome.ai|awesome.ai>
U07HXFWUD : but those testcard palettes are quite the theme
U0GT2FAPQ : Hi guys... Check out my product landing page <http://www.productmafia.com|www.productmafia.com> . Its especially for makers , people who build products and side projects frequently and people who are more enthusiastic about making products. And any feedback is welcome :simple_smile: :simple_smile:
U0FHTRT7F : <@U07HXFWUD> i think they were aiming for retro :simple_smile:
U0FHTRT7F : <@U0K7Y2SK0>: <@U0GPSB7V1>  Thanks !! you guys rock.
U07HXFWUD : hey everyone, sorry for the silly questions over the weekend, we were slapping together a hackathon (slackathon) idea. in the end it was worth it :simple_smile:
U07HXFWUD : <https://twitter.com/LAUNCH/status/704158950246121472>
U0HBN0L9M : cool project
U0HBN0L9M : <@U07HXFWUD>: was it the project made with botkit &amp; express?
U07HXFWUD : yep. and your mongo modules, thanks :simple_smile:
U0HBN0L9M : :+1:
U0HBN0L9M : You owe me a ride with that phantom :simple_smile:
U07HXFWUD : we want to clean it up before i post a URL tho
U0HBN0L9M : :gift:
U07HXFWUD : :thumbsup:
U07HXFWUD : funny, you can't do emoji reaction to emoji
U0HBN0L9M : you can
U07HXFWUD : you're right
U0L4DR2V7 : Hey guys, I'm using BotKit to code a simple bot and deploy it on Heroku, but I got a small problem. I am wondering if any of you know how to fix this.
U0L4DR2V7 : I'm deploying index.js to Heroku, but how can I define the SLACK_TOKEN?
U0KJ5A91V : <@U0L4DR2V7>: go the the configuration panel
U0KJ5A91V : (the rightmost item)
U0L4DR2V7 : which configuration panel?
U0KJ5A91V : then config vars
U0KJ5A91V : `Settings`
U0L4DR2V7 : where is this may i ask? is this in slack or heroku?
U0CSJUB1D : Heroku
U0KJ5A91V : Heroku
U0KJ5A91V : Click the `Reveal config vars` button
U0L4DR2V7 : ermegurd. found it!
U0L4DR2V7 : thank you so much <@U0KJ5A91V>!
U0KJ5A91V : enter your key/value pair :wink:
U0L4DR2V7 : and <@U0CSJUB1D> also! thanks for your help guys! :simple_smile:
U0KJ5A91V : there should also be a way to do it from the heroku command line
U0L4DR2V7 : alright. thank you very much for your prompt and helpful response <@U0KJ5A91V>!
U0L4DR2V7 : <@U0KJ5A91V>: btw, do i still need to add anything to my index file? like refer to this for the SLACK_TOKEN?
U0L4DR2V7 : or is it automatic?
U0KJ5A91V : `process.env.SLACK_TOKEN` will work
U0L4DR2V7 : oh okay. thank you again!
U0L4DR2V7 : <@U0KJ5A91V>: when i deployed it on heroku, this is what came out.
U0L4DR2V7 : Error R10 (Boot timeout) -&gt; Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 60 seconds of launch
U0KJ5A91V : you need to set `BOTKIT_PORT` if you aren't already
U0L4DR2V7 : what do i need to set it to again?
U0L4DR2V7 : ill set that in config in heroku again right?
U0KJ5A91V : 3000? I'm actually not 100% sure that's the cause of the issue
U0L4DR2V7 : ah ok. i just deployed now. hopefully it'll work. thanks <@U0KJ5A91V> again! :simple_smile:
U0GQ2JCCA : maybe i'm being slow
U0GQ2JCCA : like really really slow
U0GQ2JCCA : but i'm having an error deleting messages i think, as a bot, which can do that
U0GQ2JCCA : not a slack api error, just that nothing is happening, but i'm also not sure what i'm doing wrong
U0JAVM98A : anyone knows if there a RSS/ bot version of <https://api.slack.com/docs/changelog>
U0JAVM98A : so we don't have to check the website every minutes...
U0GQ2JCCA : was actually *kinda* going to suggest that
U0GQ2JCCA : you could have something constantly checking it and comparing it to a cached version or something, but as far as i've seen there's a lot of discussion between scraping
U0GQ2JCCA : though a lot of times they post it over on @SlackAPI anyways
U0GQ2JCCA : (and when they do, you could use this link: <https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23changelog%20from%3Aslackapi&amp;src=typd>) but now that i look at it, they haven't tweeted any of the new methods there in a bit
U0JAVM98A : so stupid
U0JAVM98A : they are slack
U0JAVM98A : it's a page FOR dev that use slack
U0JAVM98A : they could have made something smarter
U0BGYH6G0 : <@U0JAVM98A>: <http://ifttt.com|ifttt.com> to their twitter account <http://twitter.com/slackapi|twitter.com/slackapi>
U0JAVM98A : in the slackapi, there s no info of the webpage
U0GPSB7V1 : parsing email addresses out of slack messages on the RTM :rage:
U0GPSB7V1 : ugh.
U0GPSB7V1 : why.
U0HUZ214H : Nice job @dscan!
U0PJ9ANR0 : howdy
U0PJ9ANR0 : can anyone answer a question about custom bots?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0PJ9ANR0>: ask away :simple_smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : better to ask directly rather than asking about asking :wink:
U0PJ9ANR0 : we are wondering what happens to messages that get sent to us by RTM when our connection goes down, say when we are deploying new code
U0PJ9ANR0 : or even by HTTP
U0PJ9ANR0 : any way to get them?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0PJ9ANR0>: it depends, if you are using a regular bot installed with a Slack button, no luck
U0CS6NSF5 : the message is lost
U0CS6NSF5 : if you are using a manually installed bot or requested access to the teams' history you can check the history for old messages
U0PJ9ANR0 : ah nice
U0CS6NSF5 : there's a request to allow bots access the history of messages they got access to
U0PJ9ANR0 : makes sense
U0PJ9ANR0 : btw, how did the invite to this group work?
U0PJ9ANR0 : does it use the unofficial invite api?
U0CS6NSF5 : yes
U0PJ9ANR0 : got it
U0PJ9ANR0 : thx for the help
U0CS6NSF5 : my pleasure
U0PAHKVM0 : <@U0GQ2JCCA> <@U0JAVM98A>: You can also follow their Github repo. <https://github.com/slackhq/slack-api-docs>
U0PAHKVM0 : Should give you better diffs than Twitter.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0PAHKVM0>: that repo is not up to date
U0CS6NSF5 : last commit is from September, so better to ignore it :wink:
U0PAHKVM0 : Hah. One of the Slack engineers told me to point y'all there. :grimacing:
U07HXFWUD : i'm doing some screen recording of bots
U07HXFWUD : anyone know a way to “clear” a view?
U07HXFWUD : like cmd-K in a terminal
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U07HXFWUD>: you can delete the messages with the API
U0PJXMSER : Using Botkit...is there something like `create_bot` that can trigger when a user re-adds a bot? I'd like to send an initial DM to the user telling them how to use the bot as a welcome message.
U055FHACC : <@U07HXFWUD> open a fresh channel
U07HXFWUD : thanks both. maybe i should add a /k    slash cmd…
U0P9H897S : Hello, everyone. I'm trying to upload a file through Slack API using `files.upload` and calling in from Node. For some reason, when I pass a stream as the value of `file` parameter, I get```
{ ok: false, error: 'invalid_array_arg' }
```
What am I doing wrong? How do I send a file (multipart), if not this way?

U0L4DR2V7 : Hey guys,  I have a problem with my bot deployed on Heroku. Would any of you know how to solve this problem?
U0L4DR2V7 : Using BotKit, this is my code for my bot to shutdown.
U0L4DR2V7 : So when I ran "sudo shutdown", my bot shutdown. How can I reinitiate it properly?
U0L4DR2V7 : I went to my Heroku site and it said Application Error. And what appears in the logs is:
U0L4DR2V7 : Would anybody be able to help me? Thanks!
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0L4DR2V7>: you app is crashing, you need to figure out why
U0CS6NSF5 : oh, you added a command to crash the app :confused:
U0CS6NSF5 : that's why, you are stopping the dyno
U0L4DR2V7 : Oh. Is there anyway to reinitiate it through Slack?
