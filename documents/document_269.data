If you find yourself unwrapping, doing something with the data, and re-wrapping a lot, I find it helpful to define a `map` function
I have tried something like that <@U0CLDU8UB>, but then I get <http://cloud.jorisooms.be/2I1v291t0y2y>
which confuses me even more tbh, because I don't know why it's a List (List Cell)
or should be*
this is the neighbour it's complaining about
Can you put your code on <http://ellie-app.com|ellie-app.com> ?
sure
Great

ah, flip the args.. `neighbor :: cell.links`
lol

thanks
Good catch, I missed that too!
Guess I can get started now, thanks a lot :wink:
