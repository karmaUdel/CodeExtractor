I just needed to add Maybe String to my port it seems
slowly getting the hang of this Types thing :slightly_smiling_face:
I thought so too but this way feels like a workaround. I mean perhaps there is another way to acheive the same goal i.e. to animate some div element?
<@U0JFGGZS6> I thought so too but this way feels like a workaround. I mean perhaps there is another way to acheive the same goal i.e. to animate some div element?
<@U3F8KG1DE> it is a workaround, Elm treats the DOM as being essentially ‘write only' and doesn't provide ways to look at the state of the DOM. All attempts to look at the DOM require doing some kind of workaround.
The simplest way to do what you want is to explicitly set the height so you already know it
<@U153UK3FA> This is what I have actually done but this mean I will have to adjust this height every time I modify size of my div.
Yep, you will
I am still trying to find out a more ELM way to that. I mean CSS way is quite simple to use but not like really ELM way doing this
The fact that the DOM keeps state itself that Elm can't set or calculate is a big pain
Btw, it's just 'Elm' like the tree
is there a way to get "named arguments" in function signature when using auto-complete (Visual Studio Code with Elm plugin), e.g. via a certain type of comment?
for example I have `titleArea : String -&gt; Html msg`, but I want it to display additional info to explain that the `String` is the title text
The issue here is that the argument might not even have a name; due to point-free programming
for example, that could be implemented as `titleArea = Html.text`
you can use a record to get named arguments `titleArea : { title : String } -&gt; Html msg`
but i have no oppinion about whether this is a good idea :wink:
mh, a record... that would make some of my long function signatures easier to handle for sure
Yes, a record would give you auto-complete in a competent editor/plugin. But it would be nice to get the names of the parameters too, as defined in the function definition (if not using points-free style, which I never do in function definitions because it's just confusing)
Anybody know how to install the elm-platform binaries on a by-project basis? I have one project using 0.17 and another using 0.18.
<@U329ZV5T8> there are several tools, <https://github.com/eirslett/elmvm> or <https://github.com/mattludwigs/elm-version-manager> probably more
Thanks. I was hoping  NPM could just handle it all, but that'll do I suppose!
Pretty sure you _can_ also do it with npm/yarn; though you'll have to manually pass paths to stuff like `elm-test`
I need help! I am using ContextMenu in a div but when I right click on custom caret it select the text! any solution :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U6CQ51474> if you make an example in <https://ellie-app.com/> I'm sure somebody can help you
It's a little difficult to write an example of this because there is a lot of code, it's an SVG rect where i write a text and so i use contextMenu to rightclick and display a menu on a custom caret position! So on right click it select the word between two spaces!
But if it doesn't happen in a small example, then it's very hard to help, because it will be specific to your code
hey can anyone recommend some good sample code on how to emit different message based on parsing incoming JSON in websocket?
<@U3SARGL7Q> not sure exactly what you want, but you can certainly decode the JSON into different union type values and handle the different cases in your update function
<@U4872964V> I am trying to conditionally parse JSON, I have JSON's delivered over WS such as `{"event" : "abc", params: {}}`, `{"event" : "def", params: {"someparam" :123}}`
I want to write JSON decoder that outputs the Msg.Abc or Msg.Def, where parameters to these messages are different depending on the message that arrived
<@U3SARGL7Q> Can you maybe use andThen as in <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Decode#andThen> ?
Depending on what the event string is set to, you chain it the right decoder.
<@U2M4VPZ9D> I already reached the point where I know that it is about andThen but I can't proceed
here's my code
