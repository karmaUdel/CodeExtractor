ah that worked
Json Decode Pipeline is used for decoding records with a lot of keys
Hello all :slightly_smiling_face: A bit stuck on something, I have an update branch that sends a Cmd Msg with the updated model but the Cmd Msg is sending before the model has updated. What's the best way to make sure the model has updated before I send the Cmd? I've just made a variable for the list I need at the moment, but thought there had to be a better way of doing it! Any advice would be appreciated
I'm curious why you want to send yourself a `Cmd Msg`? Is it to prevent duplication in two branches of your `update` ?
I don't understand sorry I'm not sending myself one I'm using d3 so using it to send filtered data via a port :slightly_smiling_face:
I probably wasn't very clear
inside your `update` function, `model` always refers to the _old_ version of the model
All data is immutable in Elm so using the `{ model | ... }` syntax doesn't mutate `model`, but instead returns a _new_ record
since you want the new filtered data, you should use the same value you are assigning to the model
Ah fair enough! Thanks for your help :grin:
