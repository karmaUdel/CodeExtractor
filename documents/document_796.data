U2SR9DL7Q : anyone ever made a circular zipper before?
U2BCXMGKW : I know there's this one: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/maorleger/elm-infinite-zipper/latest>
U6D1E91QV : is it a bad idea to use routes for navigation, changing state?
U6D1E91QV : as in using a `a [ href &lt;| routeToString Route.Foo ] ]` instead of `a [ onClick LoadFoo ] []`
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U2BCXMGKW> cool. gonna look through the source docs
U2H92KKEY : <@U2LAL86AY> Some + and - symbols for expansion and what not
U2H92KKEY : If I remember correctly
U236M9FH9 : <@U6D1E91QV> Seems like that'd cause your app to re-init after every click... I use href + onClick w/ default prevented, so users can still middle click to open in a new tab
U2LAL86AY : my guess it's browser related. Copy the `+` or whatever char is supposed to be. form somwere else - 
And then enter in developer tools -&gt;  change it there to appear somewhere on the page. 

All this to see if is rendered as `+` or as something else. 

it's supposed to be a `small triangle`.

U2LAL86AY : yes, my debugger has a small triangle
U17R26VR8 : how do i decode two or more fields into a composite type using elm.decode.pipeline, ie:```
JDP.decode SomeCompositeType
|&gt; required "field1" JD.string
|&gt; required "field2" JD.string
|&gt; JD.map SomeCompositeType

type SomeCompositeType = SomeCompositeType String String
```

U23SA861Y : that would be a map2
U23SA861Y : hmm but with the pipelines
U17R26VR8 : i'm using NRI's decode pipeline and can't see how to ... yes... use it in the pipeline
U23SA861Y : umm if I'm reading this right you would remove that bottom element of the pipe
U23SA861Y : ```type SomeCompositeType = SomeCompositeType String String

JDP.decode SomeCompositeType
  |&gt; required "field1" JD.string
  |&gt; required "field2" JD.string
```

U17R26VR8 : that's to put the type tag so it returns SomeCompositeTye
U23SA861Y : it does that already
U17R26VR8 : it looks like a custom field is what i'm looking for?<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline/3.0.0/Json-Decode-Pipeline#custom>

U23SA861Y : if I'm reading this correctly
U17R26VR8 : ```userDecoder : Decoder User
userDecoder =
  decode User
    |&gt; required "id" int
    |&gt; custom (map2 ...)
    |&gt; required "email" string
```

U23SA861Y : no, you have the same problem as decoding that user type
U23SA861Y : `User` if a function of the type `(Int -&gt; Maybe String -&gt; String -&gt; Float -&gt; User)`
U23SA861Y : each stage of the pipeline is applying one of the parameters until you get your final user
U23SA861Y : in your case `SomeCompositeType` is a function of the form `String -&gt; String -&gt; SomeCompositeType`
