U0JMKBZL0 : If I remove the symlink in checkouts, everything seems to work fine.
U064X3EF3 : frameworks are things that call you, rather than things you call
U064X3EF3 : (which are more likely components)
U064X3EF3 : <@U0LGCREMU> ^^
U0LGCREMU : hmm, seems a reasonable defn
U064X3EF3 : not something I made up and probably not 100% satisfying, but I think it's about right
U0NBGRGD6 : <https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/DEPLOY.md>I'm trying to deploy to private repo according to this tut, but every time I use lein deploy, It will ask for username and password. 
I mentioned it's said there's a bug for gpg, it that mean the username and password in credentials.clj.gpg will not work, orI have to do something?

U0S3YK6HK : Hey all, I am running into what I think is a bug with how clojure's java interop works
U0S3YK6HK : I am trying to wrap <https://github.com/lokra/seaweedfs-client> for use in clojure
U0S3YK6HK : but when I try to port the example upstart code
U0S3YK6HK : ```FileSource fileSource = new FileSource();
// SeaweedFS master server host
fileSource.setHost("localhost");
// SeaweedFS master server port
fileSource.setPort(9333);
// Startup manager and listens for the change
fileSource.startup();

FileTemplate template = new FileTemplate(fileSource.getConnection());
template.saveFileByStream("filename.doc", someFile);
```

U0S3YK6HK : to clojure
U0S3YK6HK : ```(defn connect!
  [host port]
  (let [client (FileSource.)]
    (.setHost client host)
    (.setPort client port)
    (.startup client)
    (reset! client-atom client)
    (let [value (.getConnection @client-atom)]
      (reset! file-template-atom (FileTemplate. value)))))
```

U0S3YK6HK : I get an error similar to `IllegalAccessError tried to access class org.lokra.seaweedfs.core.Connection from class &lt;class info&gt;`

U0S3YK6HK : I have found <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/zr2N0dbidAI> and <https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1243> that seem to point to this being a problem
U0S3YK6HK : Any suggestions or workarounds I can try?
U0S3YK6HK : Plot thinkens, I can use the code without problems on my Mac but on Windows it breaks
U0S3YK6HK : :thinking_face:
U061HGP8C : <@U0S3YK6HK> What's the Java version on both? `lein version` should print it
U061HGP8C : Also possibly compare the outputs of `lein deps :tree`
U064X3EF3 : I don't see any signs that CLJ-1243 has anything to do with it
U0JL9D0E9 : hey guys! I want to read a stream with unknown number of lines (e.g. a file) and fire an async get request per each line (lets say using an http-kit async get with `(go (&gt;! c response))` as a callback). then, read the responses one by one into another file. is there an elegant way of closing the channel making sure I am not missing any async puts into the channel? I can do so with putting my own guard msg at the end but it feels awkward.
