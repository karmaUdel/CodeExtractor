hey, <@U2ABT6UKF>, check out <https://github.com/isRuslan/awesome-elm> for a lot of resources. I think the <http://courses.knowthen.com/> free Elm intor course might be a good place to start.
Will do thank you.

<@U3LUC6SNS> i am not familiar enough with what you are trying to accomplish here, but my best guess is trying to set a breakpoint using developer tools and follow the stack trace to find why `domNode` is undefined. Seems like this method doesn't have access to the variables you are expecting. Is this code you are showing inside your project or an ELM library? If ELM library, what is the name of it? I think I'd need more context to help properly.
If I need to use version .17 of elm would I just edit the package file or is there an nvm like tool for elm?

Where do I put files so elm-reactor's web-server will serve them?
do you mean just like the normal Elm files and such? You just want to be in the directory containing your files before you run elm-reactor. for things like external css and such I don't think elm-reactor can actually handle that and you would want to use elm-make. i could easily be wrong on that though
Can't find anything on this topic online except this, which sidesteps the question: <https://stackoverflow.com/q/39392469/1862046> Here's this same question on Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45395712/how-to-merge-multiple-effects-in-elm>
I have compilation error that X does not expose SelectItem
Hello, anyone sucessfully implemented bulk actions using ELM?
<@U2PTZFKFX> what do you mean by bulk actions? Sounds similar to what I'm asking about. I found a sequential solution using `Task.sequence` and am working on a parallel solution using `Cmd.batch`…
<@U3VCFFH1S> Bulk actions, i.e in a table, we can have the sorting functionalities, or in an external table, we can Apply functions to selected rows, i.e delete, update, or anything else,
I don't quite follow, but there's this sortable table by the BDFL himself <https://github.com/evancz/elm-sortable-table>
well, aside the sortable, i m looking for additional functionality, i.e i m loading list of items in a table. i want to bulk update existing cells,
`
so action update column, supposed to add a bulk action and send the updated result to the server
