U6D1E91QV : or Decoders, so to speak
U0LPMPL2U : so extracting each field already gives you a `Result` right?
U6D1E91QV : at the moment, yes. you got me thinking that a `Maybe` is enough.
U0LPMPL2U : Both `Result` and `Maybe` define a `map2` function
U6D1E91QV : basically, the decoding needs to only work if every field is `Valid ...`
U6D1E91QV : woa
U6D1E91QV : that may be what i'm looking for...
U0LPMPL2U : I think you could do something like `Maybe.map2 Model (fetchUsername form) (fetchPassword form)`
U6D1E91QV : yes. probably better to use (fetch .username)
U0LPMPL2U : :thumbsup:
U6D1E91QV : ```value : FieldValue raw val err -&gt; Maybe val
value formValue =
    case formValue of
        Valid val -&gt;
            Just val

        _ -&gt;
            Nothing
```

U0LPMPL2U : that works
U6D1E91QV : almost
U0LPMPL2U : I wrote an article comparing `map2` on `Maybe`, `List`, `Json.Decode` and `Random` that you may find useful: <https://robots.thoughtbot.com/elms-universal-pattern>
U6D1E91QV : ```extractModel : MyForm -&gt; Maybe MyModel
extractModel model =
    Maybe.map2 MyModel (value &lt;| .username model) (value &lt;| .password model)
```

U6D1E91QV : i'll read the article. but the code seems to be one step away from being as smooth at the json code - i would prefer to pass model only once
U0LPMPL2U : You mean you'd rather not have to call `value &lt;| .username model` ?
U6D1E91QV : yes. i'd rather have a Decode.string
U0LPMPL2U : hmmm
U6D1E91QV : i'm not sure if that chaining tricks works that decoders do, to get more than the predefined number of items as well
U0LPMPL2U : the tricky thing is that we're switching from the `Field` context to the `Maybe` context
U0LPMPL2U : What you're doing is the equivalent of calling `Json.Decode.fromString` a couple times and combining the results
U3SJEDR96 : so `Decoder` is _basically_ `type alias Decoder a = Json.Value -&gt; Result String a`, and the `Json.Value` is only passed in when you do the actual decoding, by `decodeValue`
U0LPMPL2U : if you were doing that you _would_ have to pass the json string multiple times
