if you ask your question in <#C0FVDQLQ5|specter> I'm sure someone will help you out
I'd love to take a look but that will have to be later, I'm at work at the moment
I've been using Clojure for a long time now and one question randomly popped into my head:
is there ANY case where map destructuring of *keys only* can throw an exception?
I know that vector destructuring can throw all sorts of fun stuff :slightly_smiling_face:
if you pass it something that's not a map
hm … :slightly_smiling_face: really?
nil
blows up on my version of clojure
`(let [{:keys [a b]} 0])` throws `Can't type hint a primitive local` lol
woah… different in ClojureScript!
I (think) it's probably much more likely to blow up in 1.9 with spec too
huh, nope. interesting
latest ClojureScript
yes it blows up on Clojure JVM
ok that's very interesting… good to know
yeah, blowing up is an implementation detail by the looks
