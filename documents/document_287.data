U3SJEDR96 : if I managed to read your question before it disappeared
U5QPUBDQR : <@U3SJEDR96> it works too. Is'n this a bit sily tho?
U5QPUBDQR : ({ model | captions = List.map updateVideo model.captions, debug = b },
U5QPUBDQR : ie update the model, from the model?
U3SJEDR96 : I'm not sure what you mean by that. `update` returns a _new_ model, and _usually_ that's based on your previous state
U3SJEDR96 : so using your previous model to build a new one makes perfect sense
U5QPUBDQR : <@U3SJEDR96> a yes: immutabilty takes some getting used to
U3SJEDR96 : yeah, it's important to realize that `{ foo | v = "val" }` creates a _new_ record )
U5QPUBDQR : <@U3SJEDR96> thanks. I'm very happy with this slack channel, good help available :slightly_smiling_face:
U57KYFW67 : It's not possible to include two .js files created by Elm on one page, is it?
U50SABLHE : How would I Json.Encode an array of objects to be used in a request body? Below is an example of what I need to send.
```
[
    {
        "request-id": 1,
        "action-name": "checkZipCode",
        "zip-code": "41501"
    }
]
```

I'm using the following code to Encode the object, but I'm not sure how to add the surrounding array brackets
```
encodeZipCode : Encode.Value
encodeZipCode =
    Encode.object
        [ ( "request-id", <http://Encode.int|Encode.int> 1 )
        , ( "action-name", Encode.string "checkZipCode" )
        , ( "zip-code", Encode.string "41501" )
        ]
```

U3SJEDR96 : ```encodeZipCode : Encode.Value
encodeZipCode =
    Json.Encode.list 
        [ Encode.object
            [ ( "request-id", <http://Encode.int|Encode.int> 1 )
            , ( "action-name", Encode.string "checkZipCode" )
            , ( "zip-code", Encode.string "41501" )
            ]
        ]
```

U3SJEDR96 : that should work. Alternatively, this should also work: ```
encodeZipCode : Encode.Value
encodeZipCode =
    Encode.object
        [ ( "request-id", <http://Encode.int|Encode.int> 1 )
        , ( "action-name", Encode.string "checkZipCode" )
        , ( "zip-code", Encode.string "41501" )
        ]
        |&gt; List.singleton
        |&gt; Json.Encode.list
```

U3SJEDR96 : so basically, wrap it in a list, and encode that with `Json.Encode.list`
U50SABLHE : <@U3SJEDR96> Thanks, that was exactly what I needed.
U59AF21LJ : <@U3SJEDR96> Sorry for the late reply. I actually see that as a problem, because sometimes it doesn't refresh with the value the model provides and just keeps the one the user wrote instead.
U5WD40ZA9 : Anyone know any recent examples of someone creating a dropdown so that when you click outside of it, it closes? Would be really helpful, thanks in advance :slightly_smiling_face:!
U4PT7NG4V : I've always just put an invisible overlay over the background behind popups and handled the click there and dismiss the popup. But maybe I'm old school and there's a better way
U0K92QFST : <@U5WD40ZA9> there was *just* a discussion about exactly this in <#C13L7S5GR|elm-dev>!
