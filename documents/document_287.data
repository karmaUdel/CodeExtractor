<@U41NK9BM4> I am afraid if I will be able to migrate my code to 0.19
getUsers doesn't work, though
beacause I reference a function that is not in scope…
<@U62KVQVD1> Usually there are tools to help with that, which should make it a breeze
<@U3SJEDR96> Ok, so there is hope …
korczis: Languages changes in 0.19 will be really minor. The changes in the library might affect your SPA though.
`
<@U41NK9BM4> it just doesn fell pure. I use a function in a function that i did not pass via an argument… I can just magically access this function
AFAIK routing will be simplified.

But you can't. `getUsers` can only work if you have a constant `model` function
But really, there's no need to upgrade to 0.19 the day after it will be released. Or there is?
oh, wait, you changed things :smile:
yes, sorry. It was jus aquick example. I updated this
(too quick ;-))
Of course there is not
If model changes, you get a different results. If model doesn't change you get the same results. :slightly_smiling_face:
So it's pure :slightly_smiling_face:
Calling a pure function is pure. If you only _ever_ need to get the usernames of all users in your model, use the funciton you wrote. If you suddenly need the names of an arbitrary list of users, write `usernames : List User -&gt; List String`
Thanks <@U3SJEDR96> 
Write the functions and abstractions you _need_ - refactoring is so easy in Elm anyway. Abstracting before you need it could quickly become counter-productive, and make it more difficult to change things when they no longer fit your previous model
