jimmynanuan: First at all i would suggest you to format your code using ```. Please see <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages>. Then i think your function named `getSampleText` should be called on `componentDidMount`.
The error Maximun call stack usually is throwed when you are trying to do `setState` inside a render function.
