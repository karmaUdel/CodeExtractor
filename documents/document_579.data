```
so it seems like you can't have parametric types act as constructors
Oh, no, I have `UserFields` as the constructor within that last function, not `WithUserFields`
 Let me try a few more things first
Ooh, so you think even with `type alias Thing = MetaThing {}` maybe wouldn't give you the constructor?  I suppose that's possible... very unexpected though, and doesn't seem to be documented anywhere
I would think with a `type alias Thing = ` I could put anything after the `=` and it would give me a constructor.
You did not specify their order. So you can not construct one just like you wanted.
