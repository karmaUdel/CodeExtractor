U0JFXEUCT : awesome
U0JBSEGHY : cheers!
U0JBSEGHY : that's a little unexpected behaviour since my experience has just been boot up elm reactor and float around the directories so far
U0JFXEUCT : yeah, its a little weird
U0JFXEUCT : its because there are multiple elm-package.json
U0JBSEGHY : noted
U0JBSEGHY : thanks a lot
U0JBSEGHY : :pray:
U5V0HVAKB : hello all ! someone here ? :slightly_smiling_face:
U5V0HVAKB : i am actually want to understand this syntax
U5V0HVAKB : ``` decodeGifUrl: Decode.Decoder StringdecodeGifUrl = 
  <http://Decode.at|Decode.at> ["data", "image_url"] Decode.string ```

U5V0HVAKB : i type my function as a Decode.Decoder String
U5V0HVAKB : what it mean ?
U5V0HVAKB : Decode.Decoder is a type alias ?
U5V0HVAKB : if someone can explain to me how to reproduce it with a simple example
U153UK3FA : Decode.Decoder is a type from the Json.Decode module
U5V0HVAKB : ye i see it
U5V0HVAKB : but even if i read the source code i dont understand the syntax here
U153UK3FA : `Decode.Decoder String` is a type of json decoder that will produce a `String` when run using <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Decode#decodeString>
U5V0HVAKB : could explain me how to reproduce it in code like just like this 
``` 
decodeGifUrl: Decod String
decodeGifUrl = 
"hello" 
```

U153UK3FA : `<http://Decode.at|Decode.at> ["data", "image_url"] Decode.string ` mean ‘create a decoder that when run with some JSON will look for the field `data` and inside that the field `image_url` and get the `String` value
U5V0HVAKB : i really get what about the return value
U5V0HVAKB : thats about the syntax in type
U5V0HVAKB : ```decodeGifUrl: Decod String```
U5V0HVAKB : can you show me if I would like to do this how i have to init it
U5V0HVAKB : ``` type alias Decod = String ``` ?
U153UK3FA : <https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/json.html> provides a good introduction to how to write Json decoders
U153UK3FA : The return value of `decodeGifUrl` isn't a String value that you can use, it's a description of how to obtain that String given some JSON
U153UK3FA : In the example this function comes from (<https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/effects/http.html>) the Decoder returned from `decodeGifUrl` is passed to the HTTP request to be used to decode JSON in the Http response and obtain the url of the gif
