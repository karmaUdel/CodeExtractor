/find —help```
<@U0554MQJB>: I just tried and it works for me, any joy for you?
<@U0J283T6E>: cool!
thanks mate!
We're very interested in user feedback as we've only been testing on our own slack history so far, which is a bit limited
So please have a play let us know how you find it.  The main idea is for a more _relevant_ search experience
You can use `/find —feedback` to send comments to us anonymously
for me `/find -help` searches for -help
really cool app though
congrats
it's a double dash, not a single one
<@U0J283T6E>'s autocorrect was turning - - into a long dash, the same way three consecutive dots are turned into an ellipsis
they should set `/find` to return the help, instead of searching for nothing, and remove the `/find --help`
if you want to try it anyway, watch out for the autocorrect when typing `/find --help` (when you type `h`) and press cmd+z to undo the autocorrection
yep
works
-h works too and is simpler
I don't have that autocorrect I think it's Mac specific
no Slack
yep, it's mac
I had the annoying french quote autocorrect
Thanks <@U0CS6NSF5> that's a great suggestion
hey there was a company making bots, one of the first slackfund investments, and they had an insanely epilepsy inducing homepage. can  anyone remember who that was? i wanted to show a designer friend…
<@U07HXFWUD>: I don't know if they're one of the SlackFund companies, but I came across this yesterday and felt near-seizure. <https://www.hamsterpad.com>
oh i was thinking of <http://awesome.ai|awesome.ai>
but those testcard palettes are quite the theme
Hi guys... Check out my product landing page <http://www.productmafia.com|www.productmafia.com> . Its especially for makers , people who build products and side projects frequently and people who are more enthusiastic about making products. And any feedback is welcome :simple_smile: :simple_smile:
<@U07HXFWUD> i think they were aiming for retro :simple_smile:
<@U0K7Y2SK0>: <@U0GPSB7V1>  Thanks !! you guys rock.
hey everyone, sorry for the silly questions over the weekend, we were slapping together a hackathon (slackathon) idea. in the end it was worth it :simple_smile:
<https://twitter.com/LAUNCH/status/704158950246121472>
cool project
<@U07HXFWUD>: was it the project made with botkit &amp; express?
yep. and your mongo modules, thanks :simple_smile:
:+1:
You owe me a ride with that phantom :simple_smile:
we want to clean it up before i post a URL tho
:gift:
:thumbsup:
funny, you can't do emoji reaction to emoji
you can
you're right
Hey guys, I'm using BotKit to code a simple bot and deploy it on Heroku, but I got a small problem. I am wondering if any of you know how to fix this.
I'm deploying index.js to Heroku, but how can I define the SLACK_TOKEN?
<@U0L4DR2V7>: go the the configuration panel
(the rightmost item)
which configuration panel?
then config vars
`Settings`
where is this may i ask? is this in slack or heroku?
Heroku
Heroku
Click the `Reveal config vars` button
ermegurd. found it!
thank you so much <@U0KJ5A91V>!
enter your key/value pair :wink:
and <@U0CSJUB1D> also! thanks for your help guys! :simple_smile:
there should also be a way to do it from the heroku command line
alright. thank you very much for your prompt and helpful response <@U0KJ5A91V>!
<@U0KJ5A91V>: btw, do i still need to add anything to my index file? like refer to this for the SLACK_TOKEN?
or is it automatic?
`process.env.SLACK_TOKEN` will work
oh okay. thank you again!
<@U0KJ5A91V>: when i deployed it on heroku, this is what came out.
Error R10 (Boot timeout) -&gt; Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 60 seconds of launch
you need to set `BOTKIT_PORT` if you aren't already
what do i need to set it to again?
ill set that in config in heroku again right?
3000? I'm actually not 100% sure that's the cause of the issue
ah ok. i just deployed now. hopefully it'll work. thanks <@U0KJ5A91V> again! :simple_smile:
maybe i'm being slow
like really really slow
but i'm having an error deleting messages i think, as a bot, which can do that
not a slack api error, just that nothing is happening, but i'm also not sure what i'm doing wrong
anyone knows if there a RSS/ bot version of <https://api.slack.com/docs/changelog>
so we don't have to check the website every minutes...
was actually *kinda* going to suggest that
you could have something constantly checking it and comparing it to a cached version or something, but as far as i've seen there's a lot of discussion between scraping
though a lot of times they post it over on @SlackAPI anyways
(and when they do, you could use this link: <https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23changelog%20from%3Aslackapi&amp;src=typd>) but now that i look at it, they haven't tweeted any of the new methods there in a bit
so stupid
they are slack
it's a page FOR dev that use slack
they could have made something smarter
<@U0JAVM98A>: <http://ifttt.com|ifttt.com> to their twitter account <http://twitter.com/slackapi|twitter.com/slackapi>
in the slackapi, there s no info of the webpage
parsing email addresses out of slack messages on the RTM :rage:
ugh.
why.
Nice job @dscan!
howdy
can anyone answer a question about custom bots?
<@U0PJ9ANR0>: ask away :simple_smile:
better to ask directly rather than asking about asking :wink:
we are wondering what happens to messages that get sent to us by RTM when our connection goes down, say when we are deploying new code
or even by HTTP
any way to get them?
<@U0PJ9ANR0>: it depends, if you are using a regular bot installed with a Slack button, no luck
the message is lost
if you are using a manually installed bot or requested access to the teams' history you can check the history for old messages
ah nice
there's a request to allow bots access the history of messages they got access to
makes sense
btw, how did the invite to this group work?
does it use the unofficial invite api?
yes
got it
thx for the help
my pleasure
<@U0GQ2JCCA> <@U0JAVM98A>: You can also follow their Github repo. <https://github.com/slackhq/slack-api-docs>
Should give you better diffs than Twitter.
<@U0PAHKVM0>: that repo is not up to date
last commit is from September, so better to ignore it :wink:
Hah. One of the Slack engineers told me to point y'all there. :grimacing:
i'm doing some screen recording of bots
anyone know a way to “clear” a view?
like cmd-K in a terminal
<@U07HXFWUD>: you can delete the messages with the API
Using Botkit...is there something like `create_bot` that can trigger when a user re-adds a bot? I'd like to send an initial DM to the user telling them how to use the bot as a welcome message.
<@U07HXFWUD> open a fresh channel
thanks both. maybe i should add a /k    slash cmd…
What am I doing wrong? How do I send a file (multipart), if not this way?
Hey guys,  I have a problem with my bot deployed on Heroku. Would any of you know how to solve this problem?
Using BotKit, this is my code for my bot to shutdown.
So when I ran "sudo shutdown", my bot shutdown. How can I reinitiate it properly?
I went to my Heroku site and it said Application Error. And what appears in the logs is:
Would anybody be able to help me? Thanks!
<@U0L4DR2V7>: you app is crashing, you need to figure out why
oh, you added a command to crash the app :confused:
that's why, you are stopping the dyno
Oh. Is there anyway to reinitiate it through Slack?
Thanks for the response also, <@U0CS6NSF5>!
you should restart the heroku dyno using their API instead of crashing the bot
Oh, okay. I'll check that out. But is there anyway that I can shutdown my bot from Slack and turn it back on?
i think what you want to do, it terminate the RTM connection
you can use heroku's api from your bot to restart/stop your app, you won't be able to start it, obviously, since your bot will be stopped
not shut down the whole process
Oh, okay. Thanks <@U0CS6NSF5>. I'll check out the Slack API.
<@U0HBN0L9M>: Is there anyway to terminate the RTM connection with a command that I can type on Slack?
<@U0L4DR2V7>: if what you want is to stop the RTM connection you'll have to disconnect, rather than stop you process (which is what you were doing)
none of those things will be with the Slack API
Mhm, what command can I run to do that? Is there any?
instead of process.exit(), try bot.closeRTM()
disconnecting the RTM connection will be with botkit's API, restarting the heroku process will be with heroku's API
Oh. If I perform that <@U0HH00DS7>, will I be able to reinitiate my bot from Slack?
<@U0CS6NSF5>: Oh. Okay. Thanks for the help!
np
not sure what means "from slack"
from the bot - no - because it would be disconnected
from your app - yes - with bot.startRTM()
<@U0HBN0L9M>: he could reinitiate it with a slash command
from slack
true !
Anyone else use the Windows Slack app? If so, are you having issues with it since it upgraded to 2.0: laggy UI, visual artifacts, channels not loading?
xtoq: that happens on linux as well, at least arch linux
Bah. Just started when I upgraded today; I already uinstalled and wiped all the settings to try to fix it.
For anyone interested in superscript, I created a new getting started boilerplate <https://github.com/silentrob/hello-superscript>
&gt;I had a nice chat with the folks responsible for api docs here. Working to get things updated on github…and also some better methods of notifying folks of adds/edits/deletes
So looks like there should be some better docs/API updates in the future.
<@U0PAHKVM0>: yep, I know there's some interest in sorting all these things out, it's just been a matter of bandwidth :simple_smile:
Any feedback welcome :wink:
<@U0J6HQJQL>: thats very cool!
surely slack platform will add something like that…
Hipchat has it i think?
<https://rocket.chat/features>
but, you are modifying the client source to do that, not part of an API
does anyone know if 'not_authed' is a generic error response when using /api/users.admin.invite?
looks like "not_authed" is for lack of auth token for channels.invite
<https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.invite>
not sure if that helps
You have to use a *user* token, not a bot token for users.admin.invite
And it has to be an admin
Anyone else having problems with bot messages with attachments getting blocked or throttled? I'm seeing no errors from the Slack API but now and then the bot's messages just don't appear. I'm using Botkit.
Hi <@U0PNU75EW>, I have the same problem, and users discussed about it few days ago in channel #bootkit – <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/botkit/p1456254375000678>
<@U0LFB8D25>: Thanks! Just read the chat history and joined that channel.
<http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/01/slack-roadmap/>
presume people have seen this little event today? Bit of info on their roadmap.
<@U0HBN0L9M>: “shared channels” may overlap with smooz a bit. although the oauth flow sounded complex - people on both teams have to approve them? (or maybe that was just for bots that go into shared channels)
yes, that looks a lot like our feature
I guess it's a normal evolution of the platforms
single-features apps get integrated in the mothership
if you do something too close to core platform, you run major platform risk
we have plans to branch out
that's normal
but you also have possibility to be acquisition target if you branch out fast enough … (
:smile:
like a payment system or ad network
or appstore
thanks to everyone who voted - Intro is now #2 on Product Hunt. only behind Slack's own voice launch. :+1::skin-tone-4:

If you happened to be in France on March 10, we have the first France Slack meetup lined up
<http://www.meetup.com/TheFamilySpecialEvents/events/229147442/>
The venue is gorgeous and we'll have Amy Wallace from the App Directory
Looking forward to see some of you there!
welcome <@U0PV6RU9H> :)
Slack bought Screenhero ages ago and I am still hoping they bring it back bigger and better than before... voice/video chat is a step in that direction but also kinda done too
Screen sharing with duel controls is a little harder and Screenhero nailed it
this is “first step in screenhero integration”
IDK how many people really need all the neat pair programming features SH provides tho…
I use that feature every day!
well maybe not everyday, but <@U0K069QE9> and I use it quite often
we use that a bunch at smallwins too given the distributed team thing
I just created <#C0Q1G0BRD|place-sydney> 
<http://thenextweb.com/apps/2016/03/02/slacks-friction-free-conference-calling-for-your-entire-team-is-awesome/>
That “shared a call” card looks like a new component, maybe to be later exposed to the API?
:heart_eyes_cat:
hello guys, do you have a better memory than me? someone posted a small tool where you can type postMessages params in a form and it display in WISYWIG the resulting post with slack “css"
<https://github.com/davestevens/slack-message-builder>
Hey guys, would any of you know any nice NodeJS Slackbots that I can fork on GitHub? Thanks!
Also, would any of you guys know how I can wake my Heroku server via slash commands? Thanks!
hey <@U0L4DR2V7> have you heard of botkit ?
also regarding the slash command, the problem is that you have to respond in less than 3 secs and it takes longer for the heroku app to wakes up
<@U0JPS3SHX>: Yep. I have Botkit. Regarding the slash commands, is it possible for me to run something like '/wake botserver' which would wake my Bot Server on Heroku?
Thanks for the reply, btw.
<@U0L4DR2V7>: I think it is going to work but you will see a timeout message
in slack but I think the heroku app will wake up
Would you have any idea how that would work on NodeJS?
if your command just point to lets say the homepage of the heroku app is all its take for heroku to wake up the app
Oh, okay. I'll check more about it. Thanks <@U0JPS3SHX>!
for those that are users of /todo I created <#C0Q33CTV1> to chat about new features, bugs, improvements, etc etc
peernohell: thanks!
you're welcome :simple_smile:
hi
when i install botkit, i call an api: bot.api.oauth.access and i get an error: undifined is not a function.
and i found a error on lib/Slack_web_api.js , function 'callAPIWithoutToken' is missing
hey folks, you probably saw our onboarding bot featured in Chat Bots weekly last week. Now we've released the JS framework we used to build it:
<http://blog.smooch.io/how-to-build-your-own-smooch-bot/>
it uses Smooch to connect to a bunch of different user-facing channels (Facebook, SMS, iOS, Android, Web, etc….) and back end channels (Slack, HipChat, Zendesk,etc…)
we started on BotKit and then had to take a step back and build our own framework so that we could handle the scale of requests our platform sees (it was hard to run BotKit in a node cluster across multiple servers due to difficulties in data persistence)
Take a look at our post and feel free to shoot me any questions!
Hey, does anyone know if it's possible to ( and if so, how) that certain slack apps seem to include UI changes to Slack? For example, the Dropbox app (<https://slack.com/apps/A0F82E5R8-dropbox>) creates a new menu item for importing files into Slack that pops up a picker window, as well as a new menu item on other files you upload into Slack that saves them to your Dropbox account. I haven't found any documentation that would tell me how to do this, so is this some secret first party integration that developers don't have access to?
I can understand it for output, but it seems strange to unescape input
a lot of content is converted to escaped HTML by the api and it's up to the client to render it
i'd prefer it weren't so :simple_smile:
is there an easy way to expire a ‘typing' indicator for a bot i'm working on? even after I send a message it seems to persist, and only goes away after a few seconds after the bot sends a message.
i believe it goes away after like, 3 seconds or so?
let me see if i can find it in the docs
<https://i.imgur.com/eitzqbv.png>
oh
expire, my bad
Slack call is so good!  Skype will be getting no love from my team :simple_smile:  Thanks Slack gods!
i was hoping slack would buy sqwiggle/speak.io
that would have scared the :shit: out of skype
Skype's free admin panel is going away at the end of the month... they can go to hell &amp; I will go to Texas.
We did a team call with 2 guys remote.   I created a ‘call' in a channel and everyone in the channel could join, was an excellent experience and sound/voice was perfect.
i tried the Talko integration. blah.
crashed and burned.
so many people have tried to build that thing and failed
I would say Slack nailed it, least on my first impression.
how did you get access to this feature?
you have to have the desktop version (mac or pc)
go to...
I clicked Manage your team -&gt; Team settings -&gt; scroll down to ‘Calls'
checkbox enabled and good to go.
Oh, you can go directly to ‘Team Settings' my bad.
mind. blown.
it's neat, we have a channel for meetings and I just clicked the ‘phone' icon while in the channel and anyone in the channel can join…bad ass :wink:
Anybody explored AWS Lamba for Slack integration. Specifically, if anyone has successfully used `slack-echo-command` blueprint ? I am stuck at ...
     following body: { "body": $input.json("$") }
Hello - Anybody see delays with reactions being sent from the Mac Desktop client ? I'm having sometimes 10min delays (as seen from app but also from normal conversations with friends)
<@U0P0ZF0AC>: i thought about it but the bots i'm working on all do things that require state for long periods of time
Any feedback appreciated! <http://producthunt.com>
Hey, can anyone help me on `invalid_array_arg` error i am getting while postMessage. Thanks
<@U0M9PS5J4>: can you post your request in a snippet?
but it works without the attachment, right?
Yeah <@U0GPSB7V1>
<@U0GPSB7V1>: Thanks for sharing. I am trying to hit some APIs and pass on the result back to users.
is there a field you left out that's required?
<@U0P0ZF0AC>: that should work then
<@U0P0ZF0AC>: good luck! let me know how it goes
`Add a mapping template for the x-www-form-urlencoded content type with the following body: { "body": $input.json("$") } ` is the step I am stuck at. Were you able to complete it ?
<@U0GPSB7V1>: for sure, I will.
no, i haven't even gotten that far
We'll only required fields are `token`, `channel` and `text` which i am passing
<@U0M9PS5J4>: which library are you using? the official `slack-node` has a different signature - `function postMessage(channel, text, opts, optCb)`
<@U0Q4EMTH7>: I am using botkit
<@U0M9PS5J4> have you tried asking at <#C0AV5N8NA> ?
<@U0P0ZF0AC>: no. I guess i will ask there
<@U0GPSB7V1>: Ah, I will let you know as soon as I have it ready. May be a blog post.
Howdy y'all! Tell your friends, we're having another Slack Developers Meetup in SF! <http://www.meetup.com/SlackDevs/events/229351740/>
Crap, Im going to miss it
Me too. Sounds awesome, though. :fire: :eyes:
There will be more :smile:
For anyone who might be interested, I wrote this post today about how we build and deploy botkit bots at work: <https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/using-slack-bots-sparkpost>
I'm trying to build a custom bot and i want to know if it possible the bot sees all my applications installed in slack
:bulb: Idea for a Slackbot: *The Angel Listing Bot:* A bot that posts new startups posted on <http://Angel.co|Angel.co> into your Slack group.. In real time! An excellent integration for VC Slack groups.. Any thoughts on strategies to develop and monetize this?

<http://www.slideshare.net/JaswinderBrar1/topic-card-slackbot>
good use case <@U0LLUCLP3>
Hi everyone: I have a question regarding the slack button. When users authorize an app, what is the best way to retrieve the code needed for oauth.acess? (I'm using python)
Well, I used PHP at first, but currently I'm using <#C0AV5N8NA> (Node.js) and the slackbutton_bot.js file handles that for me much better. Technically you can use whatever you want as long as you can grab that JSON response from your Redirect URL file.
Hello! Is anyone aware of a way to collect user location each time a user of your bot enters a command? For instance, such a mechanism would allow a user of Uber on Slack to order a car like `/uber ride to [destination]` instead of having to include origin like `/uber ride [origin] to [destination]`
Slash commands only fire a POST request with the message, so there isn't a way to add GPS coordinates or anything like that
Sorry :grimacing:
Bummer <@U0NMBPTRT> - hope this gets changed as it makes on-demand bots a lot less fun when you're away from home
Was curious how everyone is handling testing on the Slack side. Is everyone doing it manually or is there some great tool I can't find?
<@U0F9T9KPH>: A dedicated team for testing, mocking the slack API is not really easy so...
Someone should totally do that. Ha.
<@U0F9T9KPH>: We stub out the API calls using WebMock (if you are using Ruby)
hey <@U0R28TKNC> welcome!
<@U0R0325UN>: We do it by allowing the user to update their location by telling us and then remembering it until they update it again (and of course, letting them override it in a request if required)
<@U0R0325UN>: you could always cover the most often cases by letting a user set aliases to locations like work and home etc
/endrant
does anyone have some sample code for kicking off a conversation with a slash command (using botkit)?
