```{ "modus": "Expertencheck"}```
I _think_ I worked it out - will report back later
You'd do something like `|&gt; required "module" (string |&gt; andThen decodeCheckModusFromString)`
`other -&gt; Json.Decode.fail ("No modus called '" ++ other ++ "' exists")`
your solution looks a lot cleaner and easier to understand than mine. thanks <@U3SJEDR96> <@U0CLDU8UB>
Is it possible to display an asciidoc text file as html, on the fly?
I don't think anyone has written a parser in Elm for it, though it seems like that would be _largely_ possible. There are some things that would be considerably harder, tho, like passthrough blocks. Also, ping <@U3LUC6SNS> who is involved in asciidoctor iirc
there is support for markdown, it looks similar: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-markdown/latest>
Or, <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/pablohirafuji/elm-markdown/latest> maybe it can be modified to accept your format
There is a package that helps to write a JSON encoder aka transform an Elm structure in JSON code?
`Json.Encode` which is part of the core package
Why no tab completion in repl? If I `import Json.Decode exposing (..)` sort of hoping typing de+tab will tab through imported decoders...?
The repl is fairly basic; indeed. I don't think there's a specific reason for it, other than "it hasn't been implemented yet"
Feel free to discuss this with me.  The app is still alpha, but I will deploy it on Heroku for testing as soon as a get the time to do so.
<@U5E3DU81K>, <@U3SJEDR96>, I am investigating the possibility of writing a parser in Elm for asciidoc, but that is a way off. It is a big job and I need more study and some experiments.  One problem is that Asciidoc, like Latex has no formal grammar that I am aware of, and both languages are non-context free. (Yikes!)
I believe there is an Elm parser for markdown, so it should be possible
There is, indeed; and I concur, it should be totally feasible; with the possible exception of the passthrough blocks
that's just a wrapper around marked.js tho
so let's not use that as a reference for a pure Elm solution :wink:
Ah … ok.  Yes, passthroughs are a pain.
I was wondering about that markdown one - I wonder how asciidoc it might turn out to be without doing anything
I was looking at asciidoctor.js (having been using asciidoctor standalone, the ruby one, to manually shoehorn asciidoc into what I want). But being a beginner at this programming thing I wasn't quite sure where to start. So I've adopted a strategy of manually converting the asciidoc docs to html snippets manually ahead of time, as to be honest the content won't be changing that often. But, it'd be nice to see it work on the fly, one day.
I like asciidoc in preference to markdown because: asciidoc maps pretty tightly to docbook, and if converted to docbook and then through FOP, can give you a pdf option, if desired. Also, markdown has a ridiculous variation of implementation, there's pretty much only one asciidoc. I'd write a book in asciidoc but not attempt it in markdown. Markdown is fine for enabling styling of a web input field, but not much more.
i'm doing a tutorial and the compiler doesn't like the arrow at line 67.
but my code is matched with the tutorial example
any help?
I think your indentation is off on line 65
and 72
it should be consistent with lines 62 and 69 respectively.
funny you say that, i was just at <#C4NU4FXDE|elm-format> and ilias set me straight that it is actually an intended part of elm-format
<https://github.com/avh4/elm-format/issues/350>
so i don't think that is causing this error.
Maybe &lt;http://elm-lang.org/docs/syntax&gt; can help you figure it out.
Can you drop a minimum version of this into ellie?
i can sure try! something i should learn anyways.
<https://ellie-app.com/3QLRCGyQxRYa1/0>
that is through my update portion. let me know if i should add more in there. the whole program is about 200 loc right now
<@U635238TG> Just 1 extra space :slightly_smiling_face:
Backspace before* `NewEntries`
^^^
Just found it :stuck_out_tongue:
in the future: hit "format" at the top every once in a while
Credit to <@U0J1M0F32> for calling it before he even saw the ellie* :slightly_smiling_face:
d'oh! Thank you. That's what I get for playing around with vim's yank and paste function at the same time to get nice and lazy
I've had a few indentation errors in my day :wink:
I dislike the way it's handled tbh, I think it could be done better.
Haven't thought about a solution though, so I'll shut up :slightly_smiling_face:
i think there is a way for vim to show the little lines showing indentations like i've seen on other text editor's in videos. that will probably help me
<https://github.com/Yggdroot/indentLine>
thank you. this is how i end up taking an hour "break" from learning Elm. lol
