U04SM6T2H : That's interesting!
U322K0W57 : oh nooooo....now i wont have any more spare time...too many ideas :slightly_smiling_face:
U0V93GE5R : :where we are going,we won't need time” :grinning:
U322K0W57 : nice
U322K0W57 : <@U0V93GE5R> were you going for back to the future reference here?  :slightly_smiling_face:
U322K0W57 : "where we're going we dont need roads" :slightly_smiling_face:
U36NAH5HD : is there a way to make the bot post messages that are private only to the user requesting it.?
U0KECURAT : <@U36NAH5HD> you can use ephemeral messages for that
U37LY3K0C : Hi all, does anyone have contact with <@U2DAWH5EX> or <@U0D7LHNTX>? I've had a [PR](<https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient/pull/144>) open on the Python Slack API for a week now with no reply and wanted to get in touch with them
U0D7LHNTX : <@U37LY3K0C>: :wave: I do apologize! My team has been swamped with an emergency task that has thrown our triage game off a bit. :(  I'm trying to get into a cadence of addressing issues in Thursdays so you should see something soon. Again, I'm really sorry!
U37C5V3HT : Hello Everyone! I was going through `Botkit` documentation specifically on `conversation`. I have a question that is how to start a conversation without using the `controller.hears`
```
controller.hears(['hello world'], 'message_received', function(bot,message) {

  // start a conversation to handle this response.
  bot.startConversation(message,function(err,convo) {

    convo.say('Hello!');
    convo.say('Have a nice day!');

  });
});
```

The above snippet is taken from github, but I need to know more in-depth tutorials such as `convo.say` `convo.next` etc. On Github, it's limited content. :disappointed:

U3236DR4Z : Hi guys,
U3236DR4Z : i want to work with buttons in my slack app, But on clink the button, it doesn't send any reponse to the specified 'Request URL'
U3236DR4Z : Can anyone help me ?
U3236DR4Z : Thank you
U20TEUNF8 : <@U3236DR4Z> DM me your code and I'll take a look if I get time

U3236DR4Z : <@U20TEUNF8>  i am working with python
U20TEUNF8 : Ah, should have asked first, I'm only familiar with node, sorry
U3236DR4Z : :disappointed:
U0KECURAT : <@U3236DR4Z> what happens when you click the button? Do you get a response from slack in the client?
U06E352LU : hey :robot_face: folks :slightly_smiling_face:Don't if you've looked on ProductHunt today, but I've posted a great bot I've discovered at WebSummit in Lisbon: <https://www.producthunt.com/posts/mailclark-3>
and it's made by someone from this community :smile: <@U0KH7478W> 
Im sure they will appreciate your feedback

U0KH7478W : <@U06E352LU> Many thanks Nicolas!If you want to give MailClark a try, you'll find him in <#C0W8D5D41|app-mailclark>
And, yes, your feedback is much appreciated.

U385GLV7S : anyone in for a short survey on slack? 100€ in total as amazon gift-cards, 10 minutes. thanks! <http://ww2.unipark.de/uc/slack/>
U36PZJHQQ : how might i go about taking a `message_received`and then posting that message in a different channel? IE, the bot receives a private message and then posts that exact message to <#C04SM6TAK|general> ?
U322K0W57 : <@U1DDKQPGB> Nice work on bcrm :slightly_smiling_face:
U322K0W57 : just hooked it up
U322K0W57 : one question though
U322K0W57 : even though i have selected Facebook bot at the beginning, after the configure phase i still see only slack stuff
U1DDKQPGB : Shoot - how can I help <@U322K0W57>
U322K0W57 : is it going to switch to facebook once calls are coming in?
U322K0W57 : because i configured my facebook bot 3 times on the platform till i realised nothing is happening :slightly_smiling_face:
U1DDKQPGB : ah yup we're looking into that tonight. Sorry about that. Ben from Botkit pointed that out to us. <@U3020AK8U> is on the case. You should immediately see all your users.
U322K0W57 : awesome, i though im doing something wrong
U322K0W57 : i just wanted to see the bot i configured, even though there was no data
U322K0W57 : as i havent configured my get/set mongo side
U1DDKQPGB : Sorry for wasting your time on that. We're going to dedicate the top real estate to a ticker-like notification of a known issue that's likely to cause you pain :slightly_smiling_face:
U322K0W57 : what do you mean?
U1DDKQPGB : Would love to get feedback as we have much to add - such as:1. Message Formatting
2. More segmentation/filtering
3. More...

U322K0W57 : i mean about the ticker-like notification
U1DDKQPGB : The top of the dashboard - we'll put up known issues like this one as you wouldn't have known without asking me - which is far from ideal
U322K0W57 : oh yeah
U322K0W57 : thats not anoying at all
U322K0W57 : i like that
U322K0W57 : digital ocean does that an i love it :slightly_smiling_face:
U1DDKQPGB : cool :slightly_smiling_face:
U322K0W57 : as i know when there are problems, proving that i am not crazy :slightly_smiling_face:
U322K0W57 : a user informed is a happy user :slightly_smiling_face:
U1DDKQPGB : yeah exactly - thought of it only yesterday so we'll implement that in the coming days too. Your time is precious - which is why we're spending most of our time right now, on improving what's there
U322K0W57 : agree completely and ill be happy to provide as much feedback as possible
U322K0W57 : the bot im doing is for a very big project
U322K0W57 : and stability is a key factor
U1DDKQPGB : awesome thanks - ping me on here, <mailto:paul@bcrm.com|paul@bcrm.com> or wherever. BTW you should sign up to this channel - it's an open channel for dev/designers of chatbots <https://openchatbotbybcrm.typeform.com/to/t899Li>
U322K0W57 : but i can talk more about that in a private convo if thats ok :slightly_smiling_face:
U1DDKQPGB : I hear you. We made a major update which is why it's failing this second - my last company was a software testing company so I hear you! My bad and my fault for allowing that to break. We've updated our staging server so shouldn't happen again.
U1DDKQPGB : Yeah do DM me please - would love to hear more. I was at the Slack HQ today and my MetaCert demo failed - talk about a day of crappy software!!
U322K0W57 : hahaha...happens all the time
U322K0W57 : built a robot for samsung one time
U322K0W57 : 2 years ago
U1DDKQPGB : Yeah but for someone who has spent the guts of their career in testing it's a little ironic
U322K0W57 : demo day in spain with all the top dogs
U322K0W57 : didnt work
U322K0W57 : :)))
U1DDKQPGB : I just realized that we're taking up the general channel - I'm new on this channel so not sure if that's cool - shall we take this to DM?
U37C5V3HT : It's fine <@U1DDKQPGB> and <@U322K0W57> though it's a good discussion, and I believe that can help others too, or else <#C04SM6TAK|general> could be flooded with code snippets lol. :simple_smile:
U1DDKQPGB : We took it private <@U37C5V3HT> :)
U37C5V3HT : hehe! No issue :simple_smile:
U37C5V3HT : I have a very silly question though I'm a designer.
U37C5V3HT : whenever I'm downloading the Botkit files from github I get the entire set along with `lib` folder having `middleware` etc. I'm testing my slack bot locally using the same folder having botkit version 0.4.1. My concern is while `deploying` let's say on `beepboop` do I have to upload all these files?
U322K0W57 : no
U322K0W57 : first of all, you should not build your bot on top of what you get from botkit github
U322K0W57 : as it contains a lot of readme files, exmaple files and libraries for things you deff dont need
U37C5V3HT : I thought so
U322K0W57 : you shoule get your bot running
U37C5V3HT : like related to other platform
U322K0W57 : with the files you need for it to run and libraries you need
U322K0W57 : and when an update comes in
U322K0W57 : you just overwrite the core files in the lib folder
U37C5V3HT : okay
U322K0W57 : you can also see in github what was commited, which files where changed...etc
U37C5V3HT : and the Botkit's version number goes under its `package.json` file i'm correct?
U322K0W57 : i cant help you a lot in your particular case as i dont know your project and your infrastructure, i can only give you general advice
U322K0W57 : yes
U322K0W57 : the botkit version should be in the package.json file
U37C5V3HT : That work <@U322K0W57> Thank you so much.
U37C5V3HT : yeah i was inspecting lol
U37C5V3HT : Thanks
U37C5V3HT : :joy:
U37C5V3HT : cool
U322K0W57 : no worries, thats why we are here
U37C5V3HT : Okay Cheers! :simple_smile:
U3236DR4Z : Hi <@U0KECURAT> ,
U3236DR4Z : i  only get a from slackbot " Darn – that didn't work. Only Slack Apps can add interactive elements to messages. Manage your apps here: <https://api.slack.com/apps/> any response from slack " .But don't get any response in slack client
U0KECURAT : <@U3236DR4Z> sounds like you have a custom integration and not an app&gt;&gt;&gt; Posting messages with buttons requires registering a Slack app. Interactive messages cannot be posted using a custom integration. Create an app if you don't already have one
<https://api.slack.com/docs/message-buttons>

U3236DR4Z : okay Thanks <@U0KECURAT>
U3236DR4Z : :blush:
U37C5V3HT : in Botkit, Does `image_url` under `reply_with_attachments` work with `Web Api` Because only the image is not rendering than anything else. Do you think the *image_url* will only work/render by given a `incoming webhook` ?
U322K0W57 : can you post some code so people can have a look at, please
U04S3JCH2 : <@U37C5V3HT> you should check out (and search) the <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> channel too
U21U8SZ2P : if someone uninstalls a bot of mine from their team, and then later reinstalls it, does that generate a new bot token? seems like the answer is yes?
U21U8SZ2P : (I realize this is probably an edge case)
U1DDKQPGB : <@U21U8SZ2P> Yes
U1DDKQPGB : and it's not an edge case actually so be sure to keep your onboarding in mind - e.g. "Hey [name], welcome back..."
U21U8SZ2P : <@U1DDKQPGB> good to know, thanks!
U0HBN0L9M : not an edge case :slightly_smiling_face:
U3AA8RX1V : Hi all, I'd like to create a plug-in that turns specific text into hyperlinks. We develop a ticking system and it is very common for people to post this type of message in slack  "Hi Jim, can you check 188877 and tell me if you have seen this issue before". I'd like to create a plugin that turns 188877 into a hyperlink. Can anyone point me in the right direction? What "kind" of plug-in do have to create to do that?
U1ZMN2FD1 : sounds like you want to do it as a custom integration
U1ZMN2FD1 : you could make a slash command, so something like `/widget 188877`, and then it would send a message with the link
U1ZMN2FD1 : or you could do the same thing with an outgoing webhook that listens for some keyword, like `widget`
U1ZMN2FD1 : so if someone says "can you check on widget 188877" it hears the keyword and finds the id and then replies with the link
U3AA8RX1V : oh, so no way to turn the actual text into a link, right?
U1ZMN2FD1 : like the text of the actual message sent by the human user? no not really
U3AA8RX1V : Yes that's what I meant. I went through the API docs and did not see that possibility so I wanted to double check here.
U1ZMN2FD1 : I don't think it's possible
U3AA8RX1V : A bot that replies with the link to the ticket is good too.
U3AA8RX1V : This way I can also include a brief description of the ticket as well
U3AA8RX1V : I'll look into outgoing webhook then. thanks a lot.
U3AA8RX1V : What do you guys use to test your app on your local dev box? Do you change firewall rules or is there an easier trick?
U07VCKRUK : (<http://ngrok.com|ngrok.com> is awesome. but you didn't hear it from me.)
U3AA8RX1V : thanks
U3AA8RX1V : do I have to set up TLS termination to use slack?
U3AA8RX1V : in <http://ngrok.com|ngrok.com> I mean
U07VCKRUK : I _think_ they handle all of that — but I can't say for sure.
U3AA8RX1V : but does slack _require_ ssl or can I use plain http
U3AA8RX1V : until I'm ready to deploy
U07VCKRUK : 'app' configs require SSL, yes.
U3AA8RX1V : ok it works ngrok handles https automatically
U3AA8RX1V : One more question, I'm using Slack Developer Kit for Node.js. the doc says I have to provide my SLACK_BOT_TOKEN. I have created a bot, but cant find its token. The doc says 
&gt; If your Slack app includes a bot user, upon approval the JSON response will contain an additional node containing an access token to be specifically used for your bot user, within the context of the approving team.

But I did not _install_ or _authorized_ this app, I created it from my Slack account.

U2GPQ5R1V : Hey <@U3AA8RX1V> - there are 2 different types of "bot" apps
1. The "Bot" custom integration - this is setup through "Custom Integrations" section of your slack team - see <http://img.jeremyrace.ca/JvOf>

The "API Token" is the SLACK_BOT_TOKEN

2. If you setup a full blown App and added a bot user, then you need to setup OAuth I think (The nodejs botkit framework has an option for handling OAuth for you, but I think if you're using the Slack Dev. kit then you may need to do it yourself - I'm not familiar with the vanilla slack dev. kit so someone please correct me if I'm wrong)

U3AA8RX1V : <@U2GPQ5R1V> Hi thanks, I figured out what they meant in the docs. It's quite a process but I'm almost there.
U2GPQ5R1V : :+1:
U101K6JDD : hey guys, what's the best pattern to invoke a scheduled service with the slack api? sth like checking a specific api call every 30min
U322K0W57 : <@U101K6JDD>  you can use setTimeout (which of course cannot be that exact, but when dealing with 30 minutes and not very granular time, it should be fine)
U322K0W57 : or you can use node cron libraries
U322K0W57 : like: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule>
U322K0W57 : depends on how complex you want to make it, but also on what you need to do. As i dont know the details of the project, i can't help more than that
U20TEUNF8 : <@U101K6JDD> something like this should do the job:```function task() {
  yourAPICall();
  setTimeout(task, 1000 * 60 * 30);
}
task();```

U322K0W57 : <@U20TEUNF8> <@U101K6JDD>  i would but seTimeout in a global accesible variable so he can clear that timeout at anytime.
U322K0W57 : <@U101K6JDD> improving a bit on <@U20TEUNF8> 's code
U39V9TU05 : hi
U39V9TU05 : where is bot_id?
U322K0W57 : <@U39V9TU05> Can you please give us a bit more detail on your question? (you probably don't want the answer: in the code :wink: )
U39V9TU05 : i created a bot.. [custom integration].. .i got token.. but the in the py code, i need 'bot_id'... i used another function to generate env var.. but... failed
U39V9TU05 : i was referring to -&gt; <https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html>
U0L55AWTY : Do you folks have any direction on monitoring a file in Windows for when it gets modified and update in a slack channel?
U322K0W57 : <@U0L55AWTY> our good ol' NodeJS can you help you there
