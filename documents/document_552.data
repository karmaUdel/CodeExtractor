U23SA861Y : ```{
informant: Maybe Person
,nextOfKin : List Person
,etc
}
```

U23SA861Y : rather then type be a property of person
U5ABF3BH7 : <@U23SA861Y> I see what you mean.
U5ABF3BH7 : Thanks
U6D3ERLA1 : ```putGrid p v grid =
    case Array.get p.y grid of
        Nothing -&gt;
            grid

        Just row -&gt;
            Array.set p.y (Array.set p.x v row) grid
```

U6D3ERLA1 : this feels sane to me
U6D3ERLA1 : Point -&gt; String -&gt; Grid
U23SA861Y : you can get rid of the case and use pipe with a Maybe.map and Maybe.withDefault
U6D3ERLA1 : :thumbsup:
U6D3ERLA1 : awesome
U6EAT2Z37 : I think something like this is my preference:
```
    updateIfIndexesMatch : Int -&gt; (a -&gt; a) -&gt; Int -&gt; a -&gt; a
    updateIfIndexesMatch index f testIndex value =
      if 
        index == testIndex
      then
        f value
      else
        value
        
    updateArrayAt : Int -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Array a -&gt; Array b
    updateArrayAt index f array =
      Array.indexedMap (updateIfIndexesMatch index f) array

    putGrid position newValue grid =
      let
        updateColumn column = updateArrayAt position.x (\_ -&gt; newValue)
        updateRow row = updateArrayAt position.y updateColumn
        updateGrid = Array.map updateRow
      in
        updateGrid grid
```

U2PTZFKFX : hello, can anyone give me a good tutorial on using ELM with REST? specially, fetching and posting contents, as well as authentication
U6EAT2Z37 : <@U2PTZFKFX> I did a tiny bit of googling and found this <https://github.com/andrewsuzuki/elm-todo-rest-api> did you see that already?
U6EAT2Z37 : <@U2PTZFKFX> it probably won't help you with authentication, but that's probably a separate issue and you can treat them individually.
U2PTZFKFX : this is not fully descriptive
U6EAT2Z37 : <@U2PTZFKFX> well, do you know elm enough to build yourself a small app from the beginning, say the counter app example? if not, it's a good idea to learn how to do that first.
U2PTZFKFX : <@U6EAT2Z37>  I have read the basic of it, and i want to integrate into a real application development,  a flask application i m building
U635238TG : unrelated to current convo but thanks for that link, composed. one of the better documented github projects i've seen actually. very helpful for me.
U6EAT2Z37 : <@U2PTZFKFX> sorry, it's not a tutorial. Maybe this tutorial by a friend of mine at work might help: <https://benkbooth.com/post/building-a-basic-ui-clone-of-instagram-using-elm-part-1/>
If you follow this through, it should hopefully give you enough insight into being able to understand what you need to know to proceed.

U2PTZFKFX : ok
U2PTZFKFX : <@U6EAT2Z37> thanks,
U635238TG : yes, thanks again! This one looks really good too
U2PTZFKFX : <@U6EAT2Z37>  do you have any idea bout http request and saving the json data?
U6EAT2Z37 : <@U2PTZFKFX> not sure what you mean by "save" :slightly_smiling_face: (or, actually, for that matter, what context you're talking about http requests in)
U2PTZFKFX : i mean pulling the data and using it
U6EAT2Z37 : That's exactly what that last tutorial helps you with, doesn't it?
U2PTZFKFX : i thought it's for json decoding only, let me read further,
U3SJEDR96 : <@U6D3ERLA1> <@U6EAT2Z37> when working with `Array`, I find it feels like to make an `Array.update : Int -&gt; ( a -&gt; a ) -&gt; Array a -&gt; Array a` on top of `set` and `get`. Or use <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/array-extra/1.0.2/Array-Extra#update>
U3SJEDR96 : Using an `indexedMap` feels like you don't really need an Array in the first place
U6EAT2Z37 : <@U3SJEDR96> sure. it makes me wish lenses existed, but oh well, not a beginner topic, apparently :slightly_smiling_face:
U6EAT2Z37 : <@U3SJEDR96> a much better solution, of course, because indexedMap is O(n) (ie it takes the size of the array to do its work)
U6EAT2Z37 : <@U3SJEDR96> I was more referring to the compositional style than anything else. Doing indexedMap is not good.
U38FTJUPP : this might sound like a dumb question, but does anyone know a boilerplate for an Elm app that uses an express server to serve the index.html?
U38FTJUPP : I was looking for something more integrated than having to run two commands (one to start the server, and another to start the elm-reactor/live/webpack/wtv)
U0CLDU8UB : Huh? elm-reactor and elm-live also serve the static files. 
U0CLDU8UB : And so does webpack, given it's configured to do so 
U6GFNSEPR : hi everybody
U6GFNSEPR : I'm looking for help with sort of a recursion problem
U6GFNSEPR : I want to draw the edges of a polygon. So I wrote a function `polygonLines : List Point -&gt; List Line`
U6GFNSEPR : where `Point` is of course `(FLoat, FLoat)` and `Line` is `(Point, Point)`
U6GFNSEPR : so the easy part is  `x1 :: x2 :: xs -&gt; Line x1 x2 :: polygonLines (x2 :: xs)`
U6GFNSEPR : but I can't figure out an elegant way to close the polygon, because the last point will not be connected to the first point. Does anyone have a good idea that doesn't involve just appending the first point to the end of the list of points in my polygon list of points?
U2J1FUQTZ : <@U6GFNSEPR> consider to convert your code to tail recursion and implement the zero condition accordingly to include the correct last point
U62UFEG4D : <@U6GFNSEPR> have a look at the polygon element in the svg package, you just need to provide list of point
U62UFEG4D : <https://github.com/sdia/Shapelm/blob/master/src/Geometry.elm#L20>
U62UFEG4D : <https://github.com/sdia/Shapelm/blob/master/src/Main.elm#L194>
U24HQ3RJ7 : hi.. i am new to CSS and have to make a web / mobile app ..I am using Elm for it. :slightly_smiling_face:
Has the community converged on some particular css library ? elm-css vs elm-style-elements vs something_else ..

U6DQCTZT2 : Is there a general name for `type alias Something a = { current : Maybe a, others : List a }`
U6EAT2Z37 : <@U6DQCTZT2> parameterized record type, I suppose. Depending on what part in particular you're trying to name.
U0FP80EKB : I generally call it a parameterized type
U6DQCTZT2 : <@U6EAT2Z37> I meant the pattern of using current and other, I know there's ziplists but they are prev, curr, remaining
U6EAT2Z37 : Oh. Sorry I'm not sure about that. I think that that (the thing you're referring to that has list then an element, then a list) is called a Zipper, not a ZipList, by the way. A ZipList is something else.
U3LUC6SNS : I have the code```
renderedContent model =
  Html.div [ (HA.property  "innerHTML" &lt;| Json.Encode.string "This is a &lt;strong&gt;Test!&lt;/strong&gt;")  ] []
```
which is called in the (`style-elements`) view by
```
named "content" (html (Debug.log "renderedContent" (renderedContent model)))
```
Oddly, it leads to a stack overflow.  Where should I look to find the trouble?

U6DQCTZT2 : <@U6EAT2Z37> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcgmSRJHu_8&amp;t=894s> using Zip List here, but he might be wrong.
U6FFMA51S : I'm reducing a commutative function (application order doesn't matter). Should I use `foldl` or `foldr`?
U2J1FUQTZ : How do I insert a `&lt;br&gt;` tag in a text? Something like `text "one&lt;br&gt;two&gt;` does not work
U6FFMA51S : (Beginner myself) but I think maybe something like `Html.div [Html.text "one", <http://Html.br|Html.br>, Html.text "two"]` would work
U6FFMA51S : I don't see `br` defined, so maybe that should be modified to `Html.div [Html.text "one", Html.node "br" [] [], Html.text "two"]`
U6FFMA51S : Scratch that, I found it <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/latest/Html#br>
U6GGSMDFZ : (also beginner) A little more defined that will compile would be ```Html.div [] [ Html.text "one" <http://Html.br|Html.br> [][] Html.text "two"]```
U6GGSMDFZ : or drop the Html bit if you are ```import Html exposing (..)``` (all)
U6GGSMDFZ : <@U6FFMA51S> in your examples the first list passed to div is for is attributes, the second list is it's contents - ie ```div [attrs][contents]```
