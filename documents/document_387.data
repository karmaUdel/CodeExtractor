U1C5N3NUD : got it :thumbsup:
U218QNMR8 : yep - i've been using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` on the same port as a workaround
U218QNMR8 : i've tried removing all traces of elm and reinstalling
U0CLDU8UB : on the same port? that should not be possible
U218QNMR8 : correct
U218QNMR8 : i mean - i'm not using them both at the same time, but it makes no difference to the python server whether or not `elm-reactor` is running or not (on the same port)
U3SJEDR96 : <@U0CLDU8UB> yeah, I've had wonky things like that happening too, tbh - elm-live + elm-reactor = weird :wink:
U218QNMR8 : fixed it
U218QNMR8 : i had some weird stuff in `/etc/hosts`
U0CLDU8UB : okay good
U218QNMR8 : ```127.0.0.1	localhost
255.255.255.255	broadcasthost
1             localhost
```

U218QNMR8 : thanks anyway :thumbsup:
U4F64AKQV : <@U1C5N3NUD> It might also be worthwhile to check out <https://github.com/Elm-Canvas/elm-canvas> for accessing the canvas API.
U62JFJWKT : if I have a "Maybe value" field, in a record and methods that take into argument value, I must call a case value.. Just..., oh there's a more elegant way to call my method only if value is not nothing
U23SA861Y : you are probably looking for a Maybe.map
U62JFJWKT : waw that sounded more clear in my mind
U62JFJWKT : I don't understand it
U62JFJWKT : Maybe.map( (\c -&gt; Calendar.view c) (Just model.calendar))
U23SA861Y : ```Maybe.map f mab = 
  case mab of 
     Just data -&gt;
       f data
    Nothing -&gt;
     Nothing
```

U62JFJWKT : oh
U23SA861Y : is basically how it works under the hood
U62JFJWKT : nice
U4872964V : So, you want to show your calendare if it exists, otherwise show nothing?
U62JFJWKT : exactly
U23SA861Y : so you can combine a Maybe.map and a Maybe.withDefault
U4872964V : `Maybe.map Calendar.view model.calendar |&gt; Maybe.withDefault (text "")`
U62JFJWKT : Ok i see what i was missing
U62JFJWKT : official documentation is not that clear about this concept
