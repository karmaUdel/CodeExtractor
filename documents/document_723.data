```
but I dont have scripts on my function Im using that function to call functions
but in raelity main is kinda of a useless function tbh
would you suggest getting rid of hte main functino?
no
find a way to make it work, not just w/ the `main()` function, but through it.
yea its not working ill just stick to calling the main function normally
I really do not how you're running it and its working? lol
careful. Keep it civil. This IS 'calling the main function normally'
I literally just copied and pasted your most recent code and ran it.
You're close. And having it all segmented into various functions is will make it very easy for you to make the small tweaks that it needs.
Stare at it... fight with it. It'll click.
Are you sure you are using the code I just posted on here?
30 mins ago?
cuz idk man it aint clicking
And I only did it to see if it would run, and if not... see what errors it produced. &lt;-- in fact, when you run it, what errors do you get?
It doesnt even run I get nothing
I run and then it stops
yeah, well I was asked a username and password and all
I wasn't at all
had to type that in then type it in again before it produced that main menu
maybe <http://repl.it|repl.it> doesn't run if __name statement
hahaha maybe. I can't confirm or deny. But if it doesn't work, then so be it... change 158 and 159 to just call main(). And ask someone why it doesn't work the way we're talking about here. Now, back to your original question... It's obvious that lines 50 and 51 are not the correct spots to declare the lists. Did you look into passing lists to functions?
No I haven't
Well I believe i have been this entire time
Where would you recommend calling the lists?
where do you think it should go? step through what you have, carefully. Did you write this out on paper first?
No I didn't 
I was thinking about putting it after menu but before the books function and then returning those values
That's pretty much the one problem I've been having this whole time lol
no. that's the only thing you asked about. There are multiple probs :joy:
like, line 129, type 'one' instead of '1'
lines 12 and 13 in register() don't make sense.
and much more. but one thing at a time.
Well 129 is just a print statement
So I can make it a little more clear if anything
109*
Again it's still a print statement
I'm deleting the list item by the index
Line 109 says: `num = int(input("Which book would you like to find?"))`
Line 129 says `num = int(input("Which book would you like to sell?"))`
that's user input, not a print statement.
Oh my bad
Well that would work
but `i` should be more describptive, like `movie_title` or whatever.
anyway... let's look at where you said you'd post the list
What would that look like?
Since you mention 'returning values', how does register and login work? In your own words.
It would allow me to use this values into another function when I call a specific using the return values as parameters
how do you see that code happening? can you type it up here?
okay.. so I asked about this b/c that's not how `return` works
I'm guessing the first step is that the user has to register, right?
yea
they create a username and a password
so we'll start w/
the password has to be 6 characters or more
we'll move this into comments under that code snipet
I need a register and login
Ok and I'm assuming we'll use it in a little bit, right?
ok
Im just trying to figure out which extensions to download for sublime
<@U5VGKQ2SY> You wanna move this over to the dm?
<#C080T8XT2|job_board>
how would one who is used to MVC based web frameworks organize controllers in `aiohttp`. The closes thing seems like class based views but they cannot contain a RESTful resource. Or am I missing something?
<@U63VCB8AH> what makes you think they can't "contain a restful resource"? Aiohttp is lower level framework, but you can design it any way you please 
how to do you access the key of a specific dictionary?
how do you*
<@U6EN2E1LG> Can you show what you're trying to get data out of? Normally it's just `dictionary['key_to_get']` to get the value out
There's also the view method if you want to see the available keys: `dictionary.keys()`
Is it line 5 and you are trying to check if the input value is in the books dictionary?
First, be sure to not override built-ins (`while str not in`, `str` is a built in). I also believe that you want `i` instead of `str` there
But you can just check `if key in dict: print('Yay, it exists!')`
but i isn't going to print out
I ran the for loop but when I go to select I, I get ‘dict_items' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
Oh, yeah you can't use integers in a dict - you are asking the user to give you an int and then looking that up in the dict
If you want to do that, you need to keep track of what keys the integers correlate with
Thats im trying to do by converting it into a tuple
but i guess that doesnt work
Dictionaries don't keep order until python 3.6, just an FYI - so that could work if you save it to a variable first, then ask for input
