U2UGVS24E : indeed, that's how it should be done
U5Z0YQN3S : Does anyone have a good pattern for propagating sub-view errors (like HTTP 404) to a parent view to have it display a nice not-found page? I was trying to follow this example(<https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example>) but it is not clear how the `NotFound` page is set.
U0LPMPL2U : It looks like it's being set here: <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Main.elm#L252>
U0LPMPL2U : in response to a `Maybe Route` being `Nothing`
U5Z0YQN3S : When does the `SetRoute` get set as the model then? <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Main.elm#L336>
U5Z0YQN3S : I'm new to `elm`, but familiar with the functional concepts. The difficulty has been the patterns of `elm`. These are state machines, but the transitions between states are hard to hunt down. Wish they were more declarative.
U5FU80S06 : If I want to call `update` programatically, should I do so, or is there a recommended technique?
U23SA861Y : umm, it is just a function. If it's the same function you are passing to program, then that seems a little odd.
U2XRG0UKA : Call it programmatically. Nothing odd about doing that.
U0LPMPL2U : If you are calling `update` programatically for code re-use, you probably want to extract a function instead
U0LPMPL2U : ```udpate msg model =
  case msg of
    Msg1 -&gt; doThing
    Msg2 -&gt; doThing
```

_not_

```
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Msg1 -&gt; { model | name = "foo" }
    Msg2 -&gt; update Msg1 model
```

U4JT89FGB : <@U5Z0YQN3S> `SetRoute` is the command passed here: <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Main.elm#L476> if you take a look at the source of `Navigation.programWithFlags` it will give more ideas of what is going on
U5WD40ZA9 : I have the following regular expression:
 "^[\s\da-zA-ZåäöÅÄÖ&amp;()+*é,.‘-]*"

But for some reason I get the following error :

(line 1, column 5): unexpected "s" expecting space, "&amp;" or escape code

Anyone see something that I don't…?

U5FU80S06 : Can `update` be called programatically from inside `update` ?
U0EUHKVGB : Yes, but it's generally not a great idea
U0EUHKVGB : You are better off pulling out the "common" part into a helper function and call that instead :slightly_smiling_face:
U57KYFW67 : `update` is just a function like anything else. But note that it doesn't actually change your state.
U57KYFW67 : so the name is a bit misleading in that regard, since it doesn't perform any actual update, but rather generates the new value of your model for the Elm runtime to work with
U5FU80S06 : That's fine.

U0LPMPL2U : <@U5FFVDC4W> here's an example of DRYing up an `update` without programatically calling `update` again
U5VTA57UN : What's the idomatic way to access cookies in elm?  (Django sets a CSRF token cookie, I need to access it to include it in a POST)
U0LPMPL2U : Cookies aren't normally used in API requests (in general, not Elm-specific)
U0LPMPL2U : Also, see this: <http://tech.noredink.com/post/147676730053/maybe-the-cookies-api-should-not-exist>
U0FP80EKB : Does Django set it as a cookie, not as a piece of the form field? In Rails, it is generally put into the form as a hidden field.
U0FP80EKB : In an API, though, the CSRF field (usually generated when building a new form) isn't used.
U0FP80EKB : Cookies, though, travel along with the http request, which comes in handy when integrating with an existing system (at least for us), because it carries session information.
U0FP80EKB : But, there's probably a question about whether you should have the CSRF token
U5VTA57UN : Django sets it as both, and it is more typical to find it in the form field.  However, because my app is an SPA that handles login, and CSRF tokens are rotated on login, I need a mechanism to pick up the CSRF token without the usual embedding mechanism.
U0FP80EKB : Personally, we disabled CSRF checking are relying on other mechanisms
U0FP80EKB : Although we don't use Elm for the login screen
U0FP80EKB : relying just on a standard form
U0FP80EKB : So we do have the token then
U5VTA57UN : That may be a better solution in my case as well.  Thanks.
U0LPMPL2U : One option would be to pass the model
U0J1M0F32 : I would pass the whole model into `htmlNote`, or the one other object you need.
U0LPMPL2U : So the signature would now be `htmlNote : Model -&gt; Note -&gt; Html Msg`
U0LPMPL2U : In your `map`, you'd do something like `List.map (htmlNote model) model.notes`
U0LPMPL2U : Passing a just the first argument to `htmlNote` here is a trick called "partial application". I'm glad to explain more if you haven't encountered that yet :slightly_smiling_face:
U5Z3Y472L : Hi!
U5KEJPXHP : <@U0LPMPL2U> I attempted something like this before and couldn't get it to work. I'm going to attempt again and see what happens. Thanks!
U3SQ42JJW : Hi everyone. I have a question, maybe someone can help. I am writing a module that I would like to publish one day. 
I am struggling with the elm package documentation.
I have a type Catalogue which looks like this:

U3SQ42JJW : ```type Catalogue    = Catalogue
        { previous : List Question
        , current : Question
        , remaining : List Question
        }
```

U3SQ42JJW : I want to hide the implementation details in the documentation. I only want to mention type Catalogue, not the whole type
U3SQ42JJW : Problem is, when I mention ```
@docs Catalogue
```
I get the whole type. But that should be hidden in the Documentation…

U3SQ42JJW : Don't know if its cleared what i want…. :confused:
U5Z3Y472L : I was looking at Richard Feldman's SPA example. In some file he uses a =&gt; operator. Unless I missed something, I haven't encountered this yet, although I followed a bunch of tutos and read Richard's Book. By example in <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Page/Login.elm> there is:
U5Z3Y472L : SetEmail email -&gt;            { model | email = email }
                =&gt; Cmd.none
=&gt; NoOp

U14Q8S4EM : Yeah <@U5Z3Y472L> , did you have a question about that? Making your own operators is almost always a bad idea.
U14Q8S4EM : I think Richards use is maybe one of the exceptions where its handy. Maybe not tho.
U14Q8S4EM : Personally I do something just like Richards `=&gt;` but I do `:=` instead. I dont really understand how an arrow conveys what `(,)` does.
U5Z3Y472L : ok, I thought it was something I did not know yet about elm, but it's a user defined operator
