then you could define some functions for that type like `toggle: Selectable -&gt; Selectable` that toggles between the two states or perhaps a `toString: Selectable -&gt; String`
`toCheckBoxView: (a-&gt; msg) -&gt; Selectable -&gt; Html msg` for displaying it
<@U0JFEBK6F> are there setters and getters for the Tab control? I want to be able to find out the new activeTab, and to update the relevant pane - it seems (to a beginner like me!) that State, Item and Pane are opaque types, and I don't know how to "get at them" - thanks!
<@U153UK3FA> excellent, thank you!
Great article! :blush:
<@U5J08KX0D> there are intentionally no getters and setters for tab state. Is your use case that you dynamically want to change the content of a tab once the user selects a particular tab ? 
Yes, exactly - to know which tab has been selected, and then to change the contents
and sorry for not posting in the elm-bootstrap channel - I've just found it! :slightly_smiling_face:
I think a better way than getters/setters in that case would be a "callback"7message  ónTabSelcted? with the id of the tab passed.
Forgive my beginner-ness! Is there a way of doing what I want to do, or will it require a change to the module? Do you mean that there is already a message `onTabSelected id` ?
Hey, Im trying to set a field in a record, then use the new field value in the model to update another field. Im using a let block to first create a model, then using this to create another one. Is there a better way? It gets very messy now if I want to have it chain further. ``
