    ( { model | location = updatedLocation}, Cmd.none )```
How can I update the submodels in one shot?
<@U2MLC3R4G> based on the types, it looks like the case statement needs to return a string
Is there some string that makes sense to return for that case?
Some reader might thinks that this branch will be possible to happen
Hmm,  I think I see what you're trying to do. You want to get the string parameter out of the route?
Yes
Your problem is that `companyId` doesn't always exist. Only for certain routes
