U050MP39D : the edn file is using underscores for the namespace, which is incorrect
U050MP39D : I'd have to see your loader code to know whether you compensate for that
U050MP39D : but, while that's a problem, it's not a problem that should yield the error you got. the error you got very specifically says the file does not exist in the cp
U050MP39D : (it could be finding the edn file because it's accessible by some other cp entry like .)
U1B0DFD25 : I think the names in `could not locate` error message should not start with a quote, so check for single quote in the edn file such as:```
{:description "Markdown parser"
 :init 'cryogen-markdown.core/init}
```

U050MP39D : ^ that's it
U050MP39D : I missed the quote
U050MP39D : you don't need to quote inside an edn file
U050MP39D : ```(edn/read-string "{:foo bar}")
=&gt; {:foo bar}
(class (first (vals *1)))
=&gt; clojure.lang.Symbol
```

U050MP39D : and in fact it's not part of edn I don't think (' etc are part of the clojure reader)
U050MP39D : yeah ```
(edn/read-string "{:foo 'bar}")
=&gt; {:foo 'bar}
```

U1B0DFD25 : It's surprising in my opinion actually. Maybe it's a bug in the lib, not wrapping with `(name symbol)` where it should.
U1B0DFD25 : Nope, I'm wrong
U050MP39D : it's surprising but I dunno about bug... the language reader and the data format reader can't be exactly the same
U1C03090C : That's probably it. I'll check when I get back to my computer. 
U1C03090C : Yep removing the quote fixed it. Thanks for your help!
U1C03090C : So I have some code in my -main function `(extend-classpath (filter #(.contains (.getName %) ".jar") (file-seq plugin-dir)))`. If I run this directly in the repl, it changes my classpath as I want it to. If I run the -main function in the repl, it doesn't work. What causes this difference (boot repl if it matters)?
U0BKWMG5B : Oh, thanks! But I'm afraid I already have an invite. Thank you anyway.
U05308A8D : <@U1C03090C> regarding `extend-class` in repl vs -main, I'm wondering if it could be related to boot using pods to isolate classpath (<https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Boot-for-Leiningen-Users#repl-dependencies>). Just getting started with boot myself. Would appreciate an authoritative answer too.
U0DH86UA1 : There seems to be an issue with 1.9.0-alpha17 in let blocks with auto-gensymed variables in macros. Is that a known issue?
U0DJC1V3R : <@U0DH86UA1> could you elaborate?
U0DH86UA1 : <@U0DJC1V3R> I'm trying to find the example that exploded yesterday :slightly_smiling_face:
U0DH86UA1 : <@U0DJC1V3R> looking again with fresh eyes, I found the bug. I had this:
U0DH86UA1 : that fails with something completely unreadable:
U0DH86UA1 : trying it in 1.8 I am getting this instead:
U0DJC1V3R : that error message seems crystal clear to me /s
U0DH86UA1 : so if I do the right thing and use `msg#` instead of `msg` it works
U0DH86UA1 : So yeah. Not a bug, just a mistake on my part, coupled with an awful error message :confused:
U051HUZLD : what is the general approach to "expanding iteration"?```
(path-to-paths
  [:a]
  {:a #{:b :c}
   :b #{:d :e}})
  
;=&gt; [[:a :c]
;    [:a :b :d]
;    [:a :b :e]]```
Is this a `loop/recur` client? Or are there any alternatives?
If this is a `loop/recur` – is there any intuition for how to know how many things I need to keep track of in `loop` bindings? I seem to spend much more time on these than it should take me.

U0DH86UA1 : <@U0DJC1V3R> i just added this: <https://github.com/bhb/expound/blob/master/README.md>
U0DH86UA1 : and got this:
U0DH86UA1 : that's pretty neat...
U0DJC1V3R : that's indeed pretty cool!
U051HUZLD : <@U0DH86UA1> <https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C1B1BB2Q3/p1501600794016449>
U0DH86UA1 : Thanks <@U051HUZLD>
U08HJGLPQ : is there any recommended way of fixing ``` java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: clojure.tools.logging.impl.LoggerFactory```? This is happening on a fresh project created with `lean new luminus &lt;app name&gt;` (running `[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"][org.clojure/tools.logging "0.4.0"]` )
U1C03090C : <@U067DHTFF> you can consider asking in the <#C077KDE3A|luminus> channel. I'll see what I can find
U08HJGLPQ : ok, will do!
