    clientId=&lt;my client id&gt; clientSecret=&lt;my client secret&gt; port=3000 node slackbutton_bot_interactivemsg.js```
u would run it as  `clientd=&lt;yourAppId&gt; clientSecret=&lt;yourAppSecret&gt; port=&lt;3000 or another port u want&gt; node slackbutton_bot_interactivemsg.js`
My console printed this
I changed the port to 8080 because my xampp is configured in that way. And the login page isn't in my local host, or im omitting something
Ok. my mistake, i had running xampp and for this reason the "login" page wasnt accessible. Now im running the integration. I'll test it, thanks for the help
hello, i am facing some problems regarding bot in slack. that after some time bot stops listening, what ever users write in DM or channel
logs shows nothing
<@U1JQ8B5BM>: I've had that problem too and for now just restart the bot every couple of days.
<@U1JQ8B5BM>: Could also be that it is stuck in a conversation, make sure every branch ends with convo.next().
no it is not listening
thanks for reply
Hey guys, is there any way to open active slack app on web and mobile via code? In our slack bot we are showing a payment link to user and once the payment flow completes we want to open the slack app.
Hi All. Does anyone know if it's possible for a slack app to have access to user profile images? I am trying to create a custom slash command, that when invoked will fetch the user's profile image and do something with it. It seems I'm able to do this by calling Slack's web api, but that requires an OAuth bearer token. I can generate a token for myself during testing, but was wondering if I can get a token when I launch the app that is not tied to any particular user; I'm not building a stand-alone slack client, but introducing new incoming webhooks and slash commands into a team's slack account. Adding a Slack Button (<https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button>) seems to provide an OAuth flow when the app is added to an team's slack account, which also seems to return a OAuth Bearer token. Is this is only way to access the slack web api from a non-user account, e.g., a custom slack app. The other alternative seems to be to create a custom SlackBot, which also gets it's own bearer token which can be used to access the webapi -- however, it's unclear if that bot will have access to user profiles/profile images.
Pretty sure the OAuth flow gives your app a token whether you want a bot user or not. Have you tried using the token that comes back in the `access_token` field when you hit the `oauth.access` endpoint?
(In any case, we should probably take this to <#C0K8617D5>.)
Hey guys I'm using botkit how do you make the bot put the @user who asked the bot a question in the response? message.user contains some sort of uuid not the username directly
Sorry will move to botkit channel!!
