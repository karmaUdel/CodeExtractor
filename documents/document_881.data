U28MDQRL2 : Any good way to do a for loop where the first iteration value is different that the followings?. I'm trying to generate an unique username. Right now i have:```
        for add_to_the_last in range(10):
            if add_to_the_last == 0:
                add_to_the_last = ''

            username = f'{user.first_name} {user.last_initial}{add_to_the_last}'
            if not User.objects.filter(username=username).exist():
                break
```

It works but there must be a better way

U28MDQRL2 : well i actually forgot to add the username to the user.
U2UP91YLE : why are you doing that <@U28MDQRL2> ,testing or something else?
U5VGKQ2SY : Need some help w/ docker.When I run `docker images`:
```
REPOSITORY           TAG                  IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
<http://docker.io/nginx|docker.io/nginx>      stable-alpine        2d13ad575b6f        3 days ago          15.5 MB
```
First line in Dockerfile: `FROM nginx:stable-alpine`

When I `docker build -t linked-nginx .`, a new nginx latest is created.

U5VGKQ2SY : How do I build with nginx image that has already been pulled?
U2UP91YLE : `FROM <http://docker.io/nginx:stable-alpine|docker.io/nginx:stable-alpine>`
U5VGKQ2SY : the whole repo-name?
U5VGKQ2SY : ok
U5VGKQ2SY : nice!
U5VGKQ2SY : one last questions
U5VGKQ2SY : `COPY /home/lex/Development/` is in DockerfileProduces
```
Step 3/3 : COPY /home/lex/Development/Web /usr/share/nginx/html
lstat home/lex/Development/Web: no such file or directory
```

U5VGKQ2SY : directory exists
U5VGKQ2SY : just noticed that what is in `COPY` is correct, but different from what error shows. Missing `/` at begining
U2UP91YLE : a `VOLUME` is a better option
U5VGKQ2SY : was just reading that... `-v` right?
U5VGKQ2SY : oh... VOLUME in the actual Dockerfile?
U5VGKQ2SY : and that will keep them synced so I can dev on local and updates container on the fly?
U2UP91YLE : just `VOLUME /usr/share/nginx/html`
U5VGKQ2SY : that'll map to whichever folder Dockerfile is in?
U2UP91YLE : and the `-v` option  when you run your container,something like `docker run -v /home/lex/Development/Web:/usr/share/nginx/html bla..`
U5VGKQ2SY : YOUUUUUUU!
U5VGKQ2SY : ```Removing intermediate container a056d20559af

U415QJJ6L : Hi.  I'm trying to deploy a Flask/Jade python 3.4 app to Azure.  I'm rolling with the built in template that comes with visual studio 2017, and publishing from visual studio as well.  the publish goes well, I can see the files made it but I'm getting some splash page instead of my Flask site.  Anyone run into something similar to this and solve it before? any help appreciated
U5VGKQ2SY : EASILY, 2 hrs searching online, watching pointless vids, and reading outdated material. EASILY! Before I came here to ask.
U5VGKQ2SY : <@U2UP91YLE> :taco:
U2UP91YLE : you are welcome
U28MDQRL2 : I was just modifyng the populate_user from a django app that handles auth. Needed it to be `first_name initial`
U5CGPBF0U : Hi. I can't get the lid off this jar.
