Hey, can anyone explain what this type annotation means ```matchers : Parser (Route -&gt; a) a```
Not the actual types involved, but rather the structure. It's not receiving a value, but it's returning a _Parser_ that in itself returns _a_ when passed a _Route_ ?
When dealing with the url-parser library, I think it's best not to worry about the type signatures too much :x
the structure is `Parser x y` if that helps you making sense of the arrows
oh. <@U0D4VR7BP>  i see it now
in this case `Parser fnTakingRoute result`, it seems like
I don't know what it does, I'm just guessing at the meaning
to the documentation I go then. I've got it all working for my own site after following the example, but this is the one part where I feel myself not understanding exactly what's going on.
I pushed the code at <https://github.com/kafecho/elm-beats>
Hi everyone
I have a small questions about how you define your records types for entities that you can create, list, edit remotely.
I have a `Product` type with several fields, but this record's `id` field is only present when this is a persisted entity.
