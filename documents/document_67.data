(apply comp (map to-middle functions))```
yea that's much more clear. funny now that you point that out I realize this is expressed in a protocol, which doesn't support variadic arguments. so either enforce a seq like `(do-map v [f])` and use the fn above^, or I think something like `(-&gt; coll (do-map xform-a) (do-map xform-b)` (though more inefficient) works too
so much functional-ness, so little time
that -&gt; form will break
that's why I mentioned using comp to avoid syntactic hoops - since `-&gt;` is a form rewriter, it will put the coll in the wrong place
hmm, ill have to look deeper at that. thanks for the warning
thanks a bunch !
