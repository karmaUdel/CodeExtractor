U0HBN0L9M : should get you to helloworld quickly
U1QFMDJUX : thank you very much, I'll check it out
U1QFMDJUX : I just read that quick tutorial to get started <https://medium.com/@katyemoe/making-custom-slack-slash-commands-with-hook-io-93ba70daf681#.wzy15ihve>
U0HBN0L9M : :+1:
U1QFMDJUX : so with botkit, can I create something similar to lunchtrain?
U1QFMDJUX : <http://lunchtrainbot.com|lunchtrainbot.com>
U1C5VL0EQ : <@U1QFMDJUX> I'd say there's a good chance that lunchtrain itself was built with botkit
U1QFMDJUX : sweet
U1QMESK9P : Hello. I am looking for an experienced freelance node developer who can provide some consultancy and further development on projects.
The first immediate project is a chatbot built with botkit.js - we would like you to review the code written so far and provide advice on issues like encapsulation (modularisation), design patterns, best practices etc.  The project is on github, with a README that documents how to install and set up on heroku.  It's very simple at the moment with only a few hundred lines of code.

The second step is to add a UI.  We will need advice on the which framework to use and assistance with the development.

You must:
* Have a broad knowledge of full-stack Node/js technologies and be able to compare their pros and cons  (e.g  meteor / angular / react etc.)
* Have experience doing code reviews
* Have experience architecting micro-services applications using task queues
* Have experience with multiple js-based test frameworks
* Be an expert-level js / node developer with strong computer science fundamentals.

If you're interested please get in touch via Slack

U0NMBPTRT : Hey all, my bot can't seem to pickup the `manual_presence_change` event. Is this non-bot only functionality?
U0NMBPTRT : I have the following code (via botkit) that never gets fired:```
controller.on('manual_presence_change', (bot, message) =&gt; {
    <http://logger.info|logger.info>('manual_presence_change: ', message);
  });
```

U0HBN0L9M : reviews and ratings are coming to slack app directory :slightly_smiling_face:
U0GT29N3A : <@U0HBN0L9M>: When is that? Do we have more information than the Trello cards?
U0JPS3SHX : <@U0HBN0L9M>: you got the email right ?
U0HUTFBHS : So, here's something weird I've been wondering if anyone has found a workaround for.
U0HUTFBHS : You create a custom slash command in your slack, and helpfully add it to the type-ahead hinting so when you type say, `/col`, `/collapse` shows up in the list.
U0HUTFBHS : Now, despite having no available options, slack puts `/collapse ` in your message bar (with the space) and waits for you to hit enter to complete.
U0HUTFBHS : How do you have it skip that last step?  I keep my slash commands out of the hinter because of this fact.
U0HBN0L9M : <@U0GT29N3A>: check the app directory agreement
U1MRS3H8R : Hey folks I've deleted an old bot I had made, but want to add my new bot with the same name. Is there a way I can add my new bot without having a number appended to the name?
U0GT29N3A : Hi there, for those of you curious about the possibility of a direct Install button from the Slack App Directory instead of a link to your website, we did an experiment. We sent half of the traffic from the App Directory to our website and half straight to the authentication page, then tallied how many of each group signed up. You can read the whole story here:<https://medium.com/@mailclarkteam/a-b-testing-sign-up-strategies-from-the-slack-app-directory-6a9425707880>

U10MPUTJP : :wave: I come bearing great news on this fine Tuesday! Our latest feature — Admin-Approved Apps — just went live to all Slack teams :rocket:The apps you build on Slack are pretty great. And we want to make it easy for everyone to appreciate just how great they are. Admins are always looking for new controls to make their job as pain-free as can be :face_with_head_bandage: So, today's feature gives admins a more flexible permission to easily deploy apps for their team — with the Approved Apps setting, Team Owners (and select others) can choose which apps are OK for _every_ team member to install and use. But, that's not all. Team members can also _request_ apps that they'd like to use at work...to do great work.

Here's why this is exciting for you:
:key: With this new control, we have a hunch that admins with locked down app settings will open up their app permissions. 
:white_check_mark: This feature launch calls attention to the _many_ apps we have available in our App Directory and encourages admins to check them out.
:mega: You now have app advocates in every Slack team! We've created a new line of communication for team members to tell admins which apps they need to do their best work in Slack.

Oh, and the neatest part? We built this feature with our very own message buttons :button: See how we did it —&gt; <https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/building-admin-approved-apps-461612d4c0c5#.vnrvc9yuz>

U0HBN0L9M : <@U0GT29N3A>: to me, what's incredible is that the direct link worked so well
U0HBN0L9M : I would have thought the direct install would have turned people off
U1LQ3C9CG : any ideas on how to structure a hear function to listen for `help` and `help &lt;query&gt;`? [‘help', ‘^help(?:\s+(.*))?$'] doesn't seem to work? I'm sure I'm doing something wrong.
U0HBN0L9M : <@U10MPUTJP>: neat feature, is there anything we app makers should do to benefit from it?
U0HBN0L9M : or optimize for it?
U1LQ3C9CG : Hmm, got it to work with: `['help (.*)', ‘help']`
U10MPUTJP : <@U0HBN0L9M>: I'd say keep doing what you're doing! There's no immediate action to take for this specific launch, but it is a great opportunity to think about the assets and content you have to explain your respective apps in our Directory — especially now that more admins and users will be browsing around looking for apps to use at work!
U0HBN0L9M : hey, while you're talking about assets
U0V93GE5R : Also you probably want to update any docs pertaining to “why cannot I install your app”? :slightly_smiling_face:
U0HBN0L9M : could we add screenshots?
U1R6NDX1A : added an integration to this channel: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/services/B1R74LYSU|outgoing-webhook>
U1R6NDX1A : testing
U0ZEF0ERJ : Hello. I need help.I'm developing a voice conferencing service that sending the voice recording URL into the channel after the conference.
I'd like to use team integration but I can't send messages into the channel after 30 minutes because of the below rules.
As you know, audio conference often exceeds 30 minutes.
How can I solve  this problem? Please, give me some idea on that.
<https://api.slack.com/slash-commands>
"In Channel" vs "Ephemeral" responses
Delayed responses and multiple responses

If you want to provide additional command response messages, or if you're unable to immediately respond to a command within 3000 milliseconds, use the specific response_url we send with our initial execution of your URL to respond to a command at your leisure. With this approach, you can respond to a user commands up to 5 times within 30 minutes of the user's invocation.

U0JPS3SHX : <@U0ZEF0ERJ>: have you consider chat.postMessage ?
U0ZEF0ERJ : As I know, with /command I can get 30-minute token to send messages and I need authentication token to use 'chat.postMessage', is it right?
U0ZEF0ERJ : I'm looking for the method that I can get authentification-token after 30 minutes.
U0JPS3SHX : to install a /command you will get a token, you can ask for chat.postMessage as part of the permissions scope
U0JPS3SHX : then use that token to post a message
U0ZEF0ERJ : <@U0JPS3SHX>: But, in team integration case I can get only 30-minute token, right?
U0JPS3SHX : sorry I am not sure in that case, I thought you wanted to build an app to distribute
U1RBDTZMX : hello, I need some help. I'm developing a slack bot using bot kit and I want the bot to hear from other bot as well. I understand that message from bot does not extends TextMessage. Is there a way to hear from other bot using bot kit??
U1DM2B4SY : <@U1RBDTZMX>:  might have more success in <#C0AV5N8NA>
U1RBDTZMX : <@U1DM2B4SY>: oh, sorry for that, I've missed that channel
U1DM2B4SY : <@U1RBDTZMX>: no apology necessary, just trying to get you where you're more likely to get an answer
U0LFH7B4J : Is there a way to live stream a video into a slack channel? kind of like periscope in slack
U1DM2B4SY : The issue would be the conversation scrolling, no? Not sure Slack is the proper medium for a live video
U0LFH7B4J : soundcloud already supports this. when you paste a soundcloud link into slack, you already get the play button and play the audio straight out of slack
U1DM2B4SY : Audio =/= video though. If it's sound I don't care if it scrolls. If I don't care about the visuals of a video, why is it a video instead of an audio file?
U1BPBKXK5 : The youtube flyout lets you play directly in Slack, but that's generally short-form.
U0LFH7B4J : yes of course that is right
U126KEXN2 : If you scroll the window up even slightly the window won't auto-scroll on new messages anymore. Doesn't seem like a big issue to me.
U0LFH7B4J : true. problem solved :slightly_smiling_face:
U0LFH7B4J : but would it be possible from a technical perspective?
U126KEXN2 : That, I don't know :wink:
U1DM2B4SY : I don't think with the public API as written, no
U1DM2B4SY : but obviously in the youtube example you can get video working, where the video comes from should be irrelevant for that (youtube even supports live vids)
U1DM2B4SY : likely need access to the native API (ie working with Slack like youtube has done)
U0LFH7B4J : that is what i also think. it needs deeper integration that is publicly available at the moment.
U1K29V7TN : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSL4x4Kif1M>
U1K29V7TN : ^ Live video from YouTube
U1K29V7TN : If Slack embeds it you can do it <@U0LFH7B4J>
U0LFH7B4J : <@U1K29V7TN>: I'm not entirely sure. Maybe that is a special handling for youtube (and vimeo for example) videos only. Do you know what I would need to make this happen?
U0LFH7B4J : I don't want to have a live video from youtube, but rather my own stream from a dedicated cam
U1H5363Q9 : New Online Editor - <https://codepad.co/>
U1K29V7TN : <@U0LFH7B4J>: If they use oEmbed you could setup a site with the proper tags but otherwise you'll most likely have to stream using youtube or twitch etc.
U1K29V7TN : <@U1H5363Q9>: What makes it better than CodePen?
U0LKH699P : is there a generic way to block a bot?
U0LKH699P : this is something facebook has lots of controls for.
U0LKH699P : i added talla and it keeps messaging me, doesn't understand stop / leave etc.
U0V93GE5R : If it's on slack you can just nuke the bot in your admin tools 
U0V93GE5R : <https://www.slack.com/services>
U1RPPMDC4 : can someone help me understand the differences between BotKit and BotBuilder from Microsoft? I'm trying to find a bot framework that would make it easy to set up simple waterfall style conversations that make it easy to take advantage of buttons and unique features of each platform without having to rewrite the bot.
U0HUNC8PR : have a question about how interactive messages..Say i post a interactive message in the general channel, with a button, is there a way i can change the message per user after they click on one of the buttons..Currently when i post response to  the respone_url, it replaces the message for everyone....
I was curious if there is a way to send customized message ...

U1DM2B4SY : no, you would have to send an ephemeral message (viewable only by the one user) to all users, instead of posting directly in the channel, and ephemeral messages are currently only in response to slash commands if my understanding is correct, so it could not be initiated by you
U0HUNC8PR : thanks for response...I can send ephemeral message, indicating some response to each user....When i looked at Lunchtrian example slack showed in their video, i got a impression that it is possible to modify the message for each of the users depending on the response

U07CW6N3A : You can modify the original message, but the modifications will appear to each user that can view the message. So if User A clicks a button, you can change the message to acknowledge that User A clicked it, but Users B and C will also see that updates message.
U07CW6N3A : On the other hand, when User A clicks a button, there are a few things you can do in response. You could change the original message, or you can respond directly with an ephemeral message that only User A would see. You can also use the provided `response_url` to continue making message updates.
U07CW6N3A : Depending on how complex your workflow is, you might be coordinating a whole concert of progressive interactions across many users, eventually coalescing all that activity into modifying the original message after all the paths have forked and completed.
U0HUNC8PR : yeah...currently i am sending a ephemeral message to acknowledge the user (The other issue i found is it does not auto scroll to the lastest message)My workflow is similar to taking a poll with in a channel....it gets little tough to update the same message when respondents increase beyond 5,6 people

U07CW6N3A : What I would do is set a distinct `callback_id` for your poll, that way you can correlate any interactions with the message back to that callback_id instance. Once you've published the originating message, also take note of the TS value for the message. Then use `chat.update` to finally update the message once the poll is closed using that TS value.  Reserve all your responses to incoming actions or usage of response_url to just momentary ephemeral messages and acknowledgements.  Might help make things less spaghetti-like.
U0HUNC8PR : thats a good idea..thanks for that
U1RPPMDC4 : With my bot, I'm planning on sending the user the link to a media player that I own. When the user finishes playing the media content, I'd like to send them back into their Slack conversation. On an Android phone, when the media playback completes I trigger a "window.close()" event within the javascript code, and that will end up closing the browser tab that was opened in chrome when I clicked on the link. Unfortunately the browser app stays open, and the slack app doesn't open back up. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get the slack conversation to resume and become the focus again?
U1RPPMDC4 : Also as a separate question, if the user decides to leave the browser window in the middle of playback, without completing it, and they return to the conversation on Slack with my bot, is there any way for me to detect a refocus so to speak in the 1-on-1 conversation between the bot and the user?
U1MRS3H8R : Anyone have any issues with a bot's name persisting even though its been deleted or changed?
U1MRS3H8R : Trying to get my original bot name back but the name seems to be persisting even though we have tried both changing the name of the old bot and deleting it
U1MRS3H8R : *Crickets :stuck_out_tongue:
U1RQECA1H : Could it be to prevent name squatting?
U1MRS3H8R : perhaps… I'd like to get some concrete info on this so I know if I should just get a new name or not
U0YQS1FAR : <@U1RQECA1H> have you removed the bot and re-added it?
U1MRS3H8R : <@U0YQS1FAR>: I have done that…. as well as re-enabled the old bot and changed it's name and removed it again
U0YQS1FAR : Was it actually removed from your Slack client? I had a similar issue before, but it corrected itself (not sure how long it took)
U0V93GE5R : yea ive noticed weirdness with slack stuff like that that was just fixed by time.
U0KECURAT : Yay, we just got accepted in the slack app directory for our bot lurchr! :smile: <https://slack.com/apps/A108GTPAB-lurchr>
U1116QM2Q : gratz! :smile:
U1S6S9XLJ : hello... i'm studying some APIs to create bots. can someone name some nodeJS frameworks that would help me to develop some demos? thanks
U0YQS1FAR : <#C0AV5N8NA>
U1S6S9XLJ : <@U0YQS1FAR>: thanks... i already used that to develop a Slack bot... however, FB Messenger API changed recently and I cannot implement quick replies nor persistent menu
U1S6S9XLJ : does botkit support that?
U0YQS1FAR : I don't much about Facebook. Try asking over in the channel I linked to
U1S6S9XLJ : ok, thank you :wink:
U0J71U1EF : Slack integration developers who want to be the Slack expert in an open source community might like to check out <https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integration-guide.html> and develop a 2-way syncing Slack/Zulip integration
U0J71U1EF : or, if you're interested in federation &amp; interoperability: <https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/356>
U0HUTFBHS : zuwhat?
U0J71U1EF : Zulip - a different group chat system
U0HUTFBHS : ah it's like an OSS slack.
U0J71U1EF : yeah
U0HUTFBHS : a+ for using read the docs.
U0HUTFBHS : How's the bot integration on that?
U0J71U1EF : it's because of Zulip that I found out you can do Markdown for RTD
U0HUTFBHS : Right, that's what's linked.  :slightly_smiling_face:
U0HUTFBHS : Syncing different chat networks is always more complex than it looks.
U0J71U1EF : onewheelskyward: <http://zulip.com/integrations/> has the list of current Zulip integrations (a.k.a. bots). <https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aintegrations> is the list of open issues re improving or adding Zulip integrations. So if someone's written a Slack bot they might like porting it to Zulip if it's easy for them
U0GRN5Q3G : Hi :wave: Anyone knows about maintained OSS library (JS, CSS) to build a message previews like in official Slack Message Builder?
U105G9BD0 : Does anyone know if there's a channel to discuss slack bot marketing? I tried to search the channels, but couldn't find anything.
U0LKH699P : <@U1S6S9XLJ>: those features aren't built in but easy enough to add
U0LKH699P : best ask in <#C0AV5N8NA>
U0KECURAT : Does anyone know why it's not possible to have a `“thumb_url”` *and* `”image_url”` show at the same time? :open_mouth: example: <https://api.slack.com/docs/messages/builder?msg=%7B%22attachments%22%3A%5B%7B%22image_url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.slack.com%2Fimg%2Fapi%2Fattachment_image.png%22%2C%22thumb_url%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fa1.mzstatic.com%2Feu%2Fr30%2FPurple20%2Fv4%2F63%2Fc4%2Fec%2F63c4eca3-9964-1297-a41b-42d8b03d5282%2Ficon75x75.png%22%2C%22fallback%22%3A%22hello%22%7D%5D%7D>
U1P3Q8JKV : as a mere ignorant user i'd say it's related to only being able to pass in one thumb_ or image_ url instead of an array: an attachment can only be represented by one image (and one icon)... Philosophically, I imagine that having several images in one attachment is an edge case and they decided against the extra effort to implement it
(like you can't tell slackbot "\n" in his responses)

You could work around it in a practical sense by adding multiple attachments to your message. Not the answer to the question you asked but I hope it helps:

U1P3Q8JKV : above snippet on slack tester:
<https://api.slack.com/docs/messages/builder?msg=%7B%22attachments%22%3A%5B%7B%22thumb_url%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fa1.mzstatic.com%2Feu%2Fr30%2FPurple20%2Fv4%2F63%2Fc4%2Fec%2F63c4eca3-9964-1297-a41b-42d8b03d5282%2Ficon75x75.png%22%2C%22fallback%22%3A%22hello%22%7D%2C%7B%22image_url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.nz%2Fimages%2Fnav_logo242.png%22%2C%22fallback%22%3A%22hello%22%7D%5D%7D>

U1RPPMDC4 : Is it possible to create my own media player that can be embedded into chat conversations similar to the Youtube integration that you see when you share a youtube URL?
U1RPPMDC4 : Here is a stackoverflow question that I made regarding the above question: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38426714/slack-create-custom-embedded-video-or-audio-player-similar-to-the-youtube-int>
U1SPKM1T3 : Hey friends - I was doing some bot research and somehow ended up here on this channel...I'm an intermediate Rails guy fascinated with bots so I'm here to learn and meet some new cool people.
U1DM2B4SY : <@U1RPPMDC4> - you'd have to work with Slack for that, there is no API options for streaming any kind of audio or video
U1RPPMDC4 : okay thanks <@U1DM2B4SY>

U0HUTFBHS : <@U1ST3RLUT>: :flag-mx:
U1ST3RLUT : please help me!!!! :hugging_face:
U1ST3RLUT : hello <@U0HUTFBHS>
U1ST3RLUT : :tired_face::weary:
U0KECURAT : <@U1ST3RLUT>: are you sure you're receiving the requests those buttons are making? And if so, are you handling them correctly?
U1ST3RLUT : hello thabk for respond
U1ST3RLUT : i have many days try this
U1ST3RLUT : in my file to response, tried many things, senda a chat.message to confirm the response, sef a sql insert
U1ST3RLUT : slack-bot always respond "Oh no, Some........"
U0KECURAT : <@U1ST3RLUT>: have you read this <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-buttons#how_to_respond_to_message_button_actions> ?
U1ST3RLUT : so, so, but i have a problem understanding.... a response_url, put this information in the app configuration.. that´s right?
U1ST3RLUT : :cry: i'm sorry, but i lose!
U0KECURAT : <@U1ST3RLUT>: I would guess the `response_url` is in the payload you recieve on that url
U1ST3RLUT : <@U0KECURAT> but, how to know if my script php is execute?
U0LKH699P : log it
U0KECURAT : How do you usually know if your code has run?
U1ST3RLUT : fisrst time, i tried re-send a simple <http://chat.post|chat.post> to know if the script it´s execute... but never response
U1ST3RLUT : thanks <@U0LKH699P>
U1ST3RLUT : <@U0KECURAT> mmmm prueba y error? to run scripts
U1ST3RLUT : nonormally whit a echo or a sql script for de DB
U0KECURAT : It's probably a good idea to figure out what it actually is that slack sends you when you click the button 
U1ST3RLUT : i try to find my apache error log
U1ST3RLUT : in my hosting :confused:
U1ST3RLUT : what you recommending me to the log?
U1ST3RLUT : <@U0KECURAT>, <@U0LKH699P>
U1ST3RLUT : this is ok?
U1ST3RLUT : i haver errors ???
U0KECURAT : That's from slack I guess. First step is you need to understand what slack is sending you and what to do with it
U1ST3RLUT : <@U0KECURAT> slack send me a json is the payload no? mmm.. when i execute a slash command I verified the token and the others params in my script PHP... it's correctly?

U1T026MT4 : Thanks <@U0KECURAT>!
U1ST3RLUT : a little help? i lose.. i taired ... please:pray:
U0HUNC8PR : check if you have all the properties sent properly when creating attachments(Like sending a callback_id) , And make sure you using Slack App not custom integration <@U1ST3RLUT>
U0K43G63U : I just launched my bot Joy today on Product Hunt. Couldn't have done it without the support of this community. Joy is the easiest way for you to track and improve your mental health. We track our physical health (steps, calories, weight, etc.) every day. But why are we not also tracking our mental health?
Join the conversation on Product Hunt: <https://www.producthunt.com/tech/joy-2>

U1NSE6M3N : Hey Guys, We are developing our product Eva bot on slack, but facing the following issue. Please give your valuable suggestions. Whave two flows: Sender and Receiver.
Sender Flow: Sender enter the details like gift type and receiver's Slack Username to send the gift.
Implementation: We starts the conversation using BotKit's NPM module using the below code:   

var Botkit = require('botkit');
controller = Botkit.slackbot({ interactive_replies: true });
bot = controller.spawn({
   token: 'Bot API Token '
})
bot.startConversation(message, function (err, convo) 

After that we asks a set of questions and at the end sends a chat(with attachments/buttons) to receiver using convo.ask method. 

Receiver Flow:
When receiver clicks a button, we receives a callback on callback url. And then we ask user to type response of next question. But at this stage we get user's response in sender flow's conversation and here we don't have any information regarding the question asked from receiver's flow. Please suggest how to switch from sender to receiver flow, so that we can get the user typed response in receiver flow.

U14TYLC94 : store info in your own database and call it fro meither sender/receiver
U1NSE6M3N : <@U14TYLC94>: Thanks for your prompt response. Receiver flow starts from within the callback url, when sender clicks the last button of sender's flow and here we have the unique id for the gift. But when receiver types in response, we get it in the original conversation, here we don't have the gift id. Should we end the conversation when sender click the last button and start a new conversation from the callback url, is it possible?
U1SSQQ02U : Hi all - we want to authenticate users for a new bot our team is building but we don't want to message all users at once. We want to post a general message in a channel and have each user who clicks the link be identified by their userId. We cannot find anything in the Slack API about determining what specific user interacts with a message in a channel . . . . can anyone help us?
U1SSQQ02U : The link is <https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar&amp;response_type=code&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000/callback&amp;client_id=1066538420620-i8ojvdhd796m5ksfgnt2glai5oq388mp.apps.googleusercontent.com&amp;prompt=consent&amp;access_type=offline&amp;state=${message.channel}?${message.user}>

U1T62AX2A : Hi, I have a question about botkit. Is it possible to spawn multiple bots in the same server? Something like this:```
var slackController = Botkit.slackbot({

var fbController = Botkit.facebookbot({
    access_token: process.env.PAGE_TOKEN,

..... how ever many more channels you want

var sbot = slackController.spawn({});
var fbBot = fbController.spawn({});

U1T67F478 : <@U0K43G63U>: cool concept. what, if any, were the biggest snags you hit using botkit for facebook messenger? in regards to tracking sentiment and mood, are you using watson for that? are there any other good api's you'd recommend looking at in regards to pulling out mood from free text?
U0K43G63U : I actually didn't use botkit (sorry <@U04SM6T2H> :grin:)
U0K43G63U : <@U1T67F478>: I am using a few different APIs and some of my own logic to determine mood/emotion
U0K43G63U : There are a ton of sentiment analysis APIs that can be leveraged
U0K43G63U : DM me if you want more details!
U0K43G63U : I would highly reccomend botkit though. It was mostly due to timing and my own situation that I didn't choose botkit for this project. I've used it in the past and love it!
U1EG97KUY : I think I'm confused about how botkit storage works, shouldn't it insert the teams automatically?
U0KECURAT : <@U1SSQQ02U>: that's not possible 
U1T9WRFUH : Quick question on persistent data storage methods: How can you use a third party database service like Cloudant, when making a controller? Do you have to define those functions (get, put delete, etc.) for that service? If so, how would you then "connect" Cloudant and Botkit? The example file here: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/lib/storage/simple_storage.js> didn't provide much guidance for actually implementing a third party database```
var controller = Botkit.facebookbot({
  storage: my_storage_provider // How to add Cloudant, MongoDB, etc here?
})
```
Thanks!
