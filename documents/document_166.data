Hi guys, I need some help with regards to slash command and direct message. The scenario is as follows: 1. User type slash command, 2. Then the code that listens to "slash_command" is being executed. 3. I would like to start a private conversation (from slash command) with asking a user a question so that he can answer "yes" for example:  ``` bot.startPrivateConversation(message, function (err, convo) { convo.say("Hello"); .... ``` 4. I'm getting an error "Cannot use the RTM API to send messages." . Questions  A - What am I doing wrongly, where to look etc. ? Additional info: Things like reply privately or publicly works fine for me.  &gt;&gt;&gt;  Thank you for understanding I will appreciate any help a lot :slightly_smiling_face:, thank you
Can you help me with that
<@U1JC7HJMC>: I think that if you use slash commands, is a separate part of botkit than the part of the bot, you need to ask for "bot" scope to be a bot too. in general slash commands answers the http call directly, and you just show that message to the user. but you could ask for slash command "and" bot, and do whatever you want
Hi  <@U0D7LHNTX> is there any way to catch the event if someone remove my app from their slack team ?
Not at this time <@U0GH3SKUJ>  Right now we just unceremoniously dump the connection and return `invalud_auth` on further calls to `rtm.start`
<@U1JC7HJMC> you will need to ask for additional scopes to send a DM from a slash command. Slash commands are designed for one-off interactions where you send a single response to a single command. But watch this space, there are improvements coming that will allow you to request confirmation on performing a slash command. 
<@U0D7LHNTX>:  from what I see the rtm service is not attached to the bot when using slash command, I tried to run `bot.startRTM(function (error, bot2) { bot2.startPrivateConversation` it did work, but now it replies twice so my guess is that I need to terminate the rtm service then, correct me if I'm wrong, or maybe the whole flow is wrong then ?
<@U1JC7HJMC>: I think you are getting confused. No surprise, the Slack platform can be a little confusing at times. DM me with the details of what you are trying to accomplish, and I can advise on the right approach.
Hello guys  what do you think the be problem when slash command display message in slack as json format. The  app response from the slash command is in json type with 200 status and content-type is application/json. I had receive one team that say it display as json format message in their slack while we are using the same slash command and didn't get that json format (just normal message which supposed it should)
<@U0TGHKPEU>: I had a similar issue, in my case the json wasn't well formated, have you tried to set your res_id as string ?
<@U1HQFCJUC>: oh i thanks i think igot it now ...
Hey guys, got a pretty good hang of writing my first bot with botkit. What would be the best way to handle a scenario where i had to monitor for multiple slackbot tokens. We have a bunch of companies interested in using the bot and they all have different slack bot tokens. Start a new node /botkit instance with token={company_token} node bot.js for each company?
<@U0D7LHNTX>: i am sending direct message through bot by `chat.postMessage` for the first time it shows icon of bot in the message then for other couple of message the icon don't show is there any way to forcefully show icon of bot in every message?
"i am sending direct message through bot by `chat.postMessage` for the first time it shows icon of bot in the message then for other couple of message the icon don't show is there any way to forcefully show icon of bot in every message?"
<@U0GH3SKUJ>: This is not particular to bots. Slack will only show the avatar username once when several consecutive messages from the same user are posted.
I'm using `chat.postMessage` for sending direct message through bot for the first time the bot icon is shown and then for couple of messages (time difference btw first message and these messages is less) then the bot icon not shown. I want to show bot icon in each and every message send through `chat.postMessage` .
Any suggestion how to do it
As <@U0GT29N3A> said this is the default slack behavior and I dont think you can change it.

There is a simple thing we do. Could someone please take a look and give me feedback?
<@U0L8LLD99>: what is it? I have no idea what it does after reading the description?
P.S. what is the best slack parser for nodejs?
<@U1JR2BL3C>: try Botkit!
<@U1JR2BL3C>: <http://howdy.ai/botkit> and <#C0AV5N8NA>
<@U04SM6T2H>: thanks
its node and it does all the basics for you to get your bot online and chatting
Hey guys, What would be the best way to handle a scenario where i had to monitor for multiple slackbot tokens. We have a bunch of companies interested in using the bot and they all have different slack bot tokens. Start a new node /botkit instance with token={company_token} node bot.js for each company?
<@U1JMYDSV8>: botkit can handle that for you
Something like this <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/examples/slackbutton_bot.js>
Any info much appreciated!
<@U0GH3SKUJ>: There is not. TO answer the question you directed at me earlier
I am creating a bot, and i want to DM a user who just signed up.
<@U1JQ8B5BM>: you'll get the user id of the user who added the bot in the end of the oauth process
actually i ahev written code for bot using botKit, right now i want to do something like this, when a user signed up i want my bot to DM that user automatically, i dont know how to trigger my code when a user signed up
<@U1JQ8B5BM>: it's exactly this: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/examples/slackbutton_bot.js>
Hello friendlies, shameless plug time, I hope it's ok
I just created a Facebook reminder bot (using botkit!). I used to create fake calendar meetings as reminders for everyday life tasks (return book to library, call back the insurance, and so on), but this bot is incredibly more convenient. Please let me know if you want to check it out - I'm letting a handful of early users every day.

thanks K
oooh it's here <http://youtu.be/RBWqz2L8DZI>
Big news in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit>: we launched support for Slacks new message buttons. 
Super cool stuff and a totally new way to build UI into messages
Just a question: is it possible to write an application for replacing the Slack application, base on Slack API?
technically yes, but why?
we can build something fun and independent or make it better
something like this when I joined a lot of Slack team
is that fun?
so you know it's possible, as you've done it, I don't know what you're asking with your question
I trying to find some co-worker or who can help give some feedback or idea for makes it better
and trying to find the reason makes people uses it replace for Slack app

Hi everyone! We just launched the Trello app for Slack - <http://blog.trello.com/trello-app-for-slack/> . Any questions or feedback in <#C0YD1A2PR> :slightly_smiling_face:
where can I ask dev questions about the new slack interactive buttons feature?
I would probably start with <#C0K8617D5>
<@U196ZMU3Y>: thanks
brianleroux: does it stop?
alas no
:grimacing:
that's crazy, we cannot even know to whom the bot is
it's slackline
<https://dev4slack.slack.com/apps/manage/A02GYML4C-slackline>
kiptastic: how you know?
clicked on the bot's face
kiptastic: obvious ^^
thanks for the tip
Did someone else had all of their RTM connections closed 10 minutes ago?
<@U0GT29N3A>: nope
Oh, ok then. But we received empty messages just before the connection closing (it's an appropriate message sent by the server just before ending the connection), so it was definitely Slack doing something on their end.
So if our bot isn't running on an https server, does it not have access to any of the message button features at all? Or is it just a more limited scope?
you can't receive the callbacks
so yes, basically requires ssl
Hm, darn. Alright
It's been on my list to get the server to https for a while anyway so I guess it's time to bump that priority up
<http://letsencrypt.org|letsencrypt.org>
easy and free
Awesome, thanks for that :slightly_smiling_face:
Hi all, I am trying simple bot using BotKit. Configured github by adding web hook url with what is generated from configuring my slack team github app (webhook url in unauth mode)
I am receiving messages in the channel I am expecting for any commits that been made in github.
I have created a bot (using slack and ran it using BotKit) and invited in the channel where github commit messages are received but I am not getting any events for the messages I am receiving from github bot. I am getting events if any user enters the message.
Am I missing any steps or I am understanding the event call wrong?
Any help will be appreciated.
TLDR: I am not getting call back events ('ambient,direct_message,direct_mention,mention') in my custom bot using BotKit when there is direct message from github bot for any changes in git. Any suggestions?
Make sure you are using a slack APP (not integration or slash command) and you have the SSL webhook setup.
You can also check the developer tools (network tab) to see if there are any HTTP or console errors. (PRO TIP) :slightly_smiling_face:
i want to do some thing like this if bot is taking time to respond user should see bot is typing (typing notification)
i tried to use this <https://api.slack.com/events/user_typing> (user_typing event) but it is not working for me
<@U1JQ8B5BM>: This is events you receive, you need to send an event in your case, that's another paragraph: <https://api.slack.com/rtm#typing_indicators>
Loving the new buttons feature!

Hi again! How long does Slack take to review a bot submission to the App Directory? Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U0GGT8K88>, depends on their workload
<@U0CS6NSF5>: ballpark? A few days to a week, or a few weeks to a month? 
best case scenario I would give it a week, but it can definitely be more, specially if you have to make changes
:+1: 
<@U0HPZF95H>: thanks for your input. I got it working by listening to bot_message event using BotKit
I'm slightly amused that we've always been told “don't send DMs to everyone to announce new features” and yet I just got 12 DMs from Slack about new features. :slightly_smiling_face:
"Do as i say, not as i do" is the saying :stuck_out_tongue:
<@U0HT0CRRQ>: <@U0F7LRC5A> lolz
I just got DMs in a half dozen slacks from slackbot, functionality doesn't seem that different yet?
anyone around to ask a ? regarding botkit?
Pretty sure slack can't tell who you are between teams yet.
<@U1KG2MAFL>: try over in <#C0AV5N8NA>
<@U0HUTFBHS>: I pondered the same thing earlier. I think they probably can, but I imagine they just blasted all the teams instead because it was easier.
Hey guys, i have a doubt regarding the oauth2. Is there a specific channel i should be posting to ??
<@U0HUTFBHS>: <@U0YQS1FAR> well they can use Intro to tell who you are between teams :slightly_smiling_face: and even maintain a single profile for you across slack teams
/intro-person <@U0LPHLNRX|mitali-introhq>
Is that like linkedin in a slash command?
yeah kinda like that
but there is a whole app behind this - we combine each Slack team members' connections into a single network so you can search for ppl and get intros through your team mates who know them
you can join here: <https://app.introhq.com/groups/slack-developer-hangout/>
so for example if i do
/intro-person Stewart Butterfield
/intro-person Mark Zuckerberg
?
/intro-person <@U1KH878SJ|aniljaiswal>
Wow, this works great
/intro-person <@U1D4WPFJL|enigma>
Lol
/intro-person <@U1KJ1K8DD|yemsalat>
hey everybody
trying to figure out how to get a list of users with botkit
looking through botkit code it seems like there is no way to do it in current implementation?
Hello, I have a couple of issues I was thinking of raising on GitHub, but thought to bring it up here quickly to see if it's worth my time
Comparing Facebook's sample app with Botkit's implementation, I notice that the latter lacks the former's function that verifies that the callback came from Facebook, specifically <https://github.com/fbsamples/messenger-platform-samples/blob/master/node/app.js#L112> onwards. Is this something that you think should be included in facebook_botkit.setupWebserver?
The other issue relates to adding an address argument to `facebook_botkit.setupWebserver` to line up with `express().listen`.  Openshift requires node developers to supply both the host and the port in order for the listening process to receive messages from the outside world, per <https://blog.openshift.com/run-your-nodejs-projects-on-openshift-in-two-simple-steps/>. I'm aware that one can bring-your-own express, though it would be nice if Botkit could do it out of the box.
Okay, disregard the second issue, I see it filed as issue #159
/intro-person <@U15SL8QHG|kevinsuh>
Hey Guys - can we take bot demos and testing to a (semi) private room?
There seems to be rooms for that. <#C0AQ7F5B6> <#C053MPU24>
That would be best. Let's try to keep <#C04SM6TAK> for human2human transactions :smile:
We need a concierge bot that messages new joiners with basic info, like where they can find rooms for particular things.
If only we had some kind of technology to make that…. :slightly_smiling_face:
/intro-person <@U1292LZFC|toychicken>
:disappointed:
/intro-person <@U1F1N7CMT|goran.vrbaski>
:disappointed:
No bots in general please!
<@U1KJXPWTA>: You should take those conversations to <#C0AV5N8NA>, it'll get more attention.
<@U04SM6T2H>: : It's kind of ironic to not want bots in <#C04SM6TAK> of a slack about bots. I'd say let them roam free and punish the humans if they misuse them :wink:
just didn't want general to be filled up with people testing that very verbose bot
identify yourself
none of my bots are here :slightly_smiling_face:
I feel like there are zero bots in this team, maybe because they are not allowed in general
(I know there are a bunch installed, I just never see them - except for intro)
and Marketspace - which I find useful, it's in <#C0JV0QA4E>
yeah there are _lots_ of bots everywhere
there are about a dozen app-* channels
I always figured <#C0JF635PX> was the botspam channel.
I think its fine to create as many public/private bot dojos as you need to show off/test your bot, and post a link inviting people from general every now and again. They are just a little too high traffic even for a channel like general.
(Sorry for the spam) looks like there are ~ 60 bot channels. I find navigating through the slack channel picker frustrating so here's a-k: <#C0RBKNXPZ> <#C0QLDL8AE> <#C0J2TRGEA> <#C0YU8V03H> <#C0J48K8B0> <#C0M01H718> <#C0K88KGUA> <#C0HMQ00HX> <#C0UED763B> <#C0HNG41HT> <#C0T9SQPGD> <#C0R1LMLHK> <#C0HJXABEG> <#C0LL27CSW> <#C0HJYN1A5> <#C0J3QB1TJ> <#C0ZCTPES0> <#C0J2RN6BT> <#C0K7TNU04> <#C0K7URRC7> <#C1ESFMKGW> <#C0ND8KYES> <#C0JHS3F7Y> <#C0LVDEBEH> <#C0J4J90NM> <#C0HMKEKV3> <#C0J2RCP1C> <#C0NG1F491> <#C0J2S5QNA> <#C0MF6GRU6>
lots of apps! I don't have a channel for mine. But all it does is post pictures from the Simpsons.
not _technically_ a bot
/intro-person <@U0M0UPJ3W|thansen>
How a about a dev4slack bot that creates a channel for another bot after it is installed and announces the new bot :slightly_smiling_face:
When the bots start creating channels that's one step closer to sentience.
This is loosely related, but is there an ignore function in slack?  I just browsed through the interface and slash commands and came up empty.
IRC clients have had that since like, the 90's.
you can `/mute` the channel
and I for one welcome our bot overlords
Well that's the whole channel and only for notifications.  I want to ignore everything a user says in the channel.
In the case where a bot has run amok in general, for instance.
Hope this isn't the millionth time this has been asked but I'm missing a step I think - I want to send the “typing” state while the bot is working on API calls. I looked at <https://api.slack.com/events/user_typing> but I don't see how I send that through the Node API. Any tips?
<@U1KQ9ECKY>: if you are using RTM you send a message of “type”: “typing” and the channel ID <https://api.slack.com/rtm#typing_indicators>
depending on the client/sdk you use there are methods for sending messages. More probably in <#C0AV5N8NA> or <#C04SX7RLD>
Ah cool. I'm just getting started with it, using Howdy's botkit for the moment
Hi everyone!
/intro-person <mailto:arora.harsh@yahoo.com|arora.harsh@yahoo.com>
^^ That's why slack needs an ignore function.
<@U0HUTFBHS>: agreed
:stuck_out_tongue:
just a question: Do you like to use the button `Add reaction`? Does it help to share your feel?
Thanks
has anyone had experience with their bot being slow today?
Can anyone help me?
Hi, I am having some issues with implementing the bot.startPrivateConversation() method from the botkit library. Does anyone have any documentation on this?
<@U1L3FF3PV>: join us in <#C0AV5N8NA>
On Slack for iOS, I have multiple groups added. I can consistently reproduce a bug where I can see one organization's channels when I am in another organization. Anyone else having this issue?
yeah
you can clear your cache
Did it, it's still there
Spoke too soon, double-tap force close did it
Hello! I'm new here, currently writing a slack bot in Ruby!
welcome :slightly_smiling_face:
Hi there!  I'm looking for a way to export all data from slack using the API.  Nothing really stands out to me in the docs and was just pinging the group to see if they have any ideas.  Had some fun with the RTM API and using a bot... but quickly learning the limitations on those methods to get all data out.  Thoughts?
<@U1L6P0RAT>: might try asking over in <#C0K8617D5|slack-api> as well 
thanks <@U0V93GE5R> will do!
Hi there :slightly_smiling_face: do you know if it's possible to embed iframes within messages in slack?
I highly doubt it, sounds like itd be a security issue to me
yea, already found a twitter post that this is disabled due to security.
I certainly hope there isn't.
<https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2016/3/9/how-to-deploy-your-slack-bots-to-heroku>
I deploy all my bots via heroku
However, I have not done any of heroku's bot tutorials
Is there a particular question you have?
Are there any resources that would help me define these errors and/or what am I doing wrong?
<@U1LJ26M35>: just a FYI we have a good active channel on heroku <#C0J63EEH0> might be worth reading through the archives
Taking a look now! Thanks!
Have you created a commit by adding files (git add &lt;filename&gt;) and then (git commit -m “commit description”) ?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that means. Do you have suggestions or resources I can study off of?
<https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1>
So is Git a language like Python, JavaScript, etc?
no, it is a version management tool
this might be helpful <http://juristr.com/blog/2013/04/git-explained/>
Hello guys, Is it possible to remove/replace the message (the one with interactive button) even if the user did not click any of its buttons, let say in a period of time if the user didn't click any of the button the message will be destroy or replace with another message. I had really hard time understanding some part of the documentation.
<@U0TGHKPEU>: if you have the `message_ts` for the posted message and the right OAuth scopes to use `chat.update`, you should be able to update a message based on your own business logic (like waiting after a period of time to modify the message)
Thanks <@U07CW6N3A> , but how should I get that `message_ts`, im using chat.postMessage method to send message with button to a user, and there is no option for chat.postMessage to set a `message_ts`
It's more difficult to obtain when a user hasn't clicked a message (since the `original_message` along with its timestamp is included in an invoked action). The most likely way you would retrieve it is by keeping a websocket connection open to the RTM API. Another way would be to periodically retrieve recent messages from `channels.history`. It's a little clunky.
Hmm, yeah that would be a little clunky since I'm not really into RTM API, I think i will find some other way around. :slightly_smiling_face: thanks for confirming <@U07CW6N3A>,
<@U0TGHKPEU>: in <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage> it says that the response of chat.postMessage has the message ts, you should get it from there (didn't try it...)
Thanks <@U11FSNKL0> , I'm into it now, Normally i didn't care about the response after sending a messages, now i think this should be give importance then :smile:
Is there a way to test botkit locally? Like type a message in a console and have the bot react just like it would if it was connected via Slack?
<@U1LQ3C9CG>: I'm not sure if it exists yet but I'm willing to take a shot at developing such a thing, if only as a quick hack. Will probably only be able to get it done next weekend though.
<@U1KMM2FE1>: I'm not seeing it in the documentation, so I'm not sure. Hubot's default adapter is console and it was really nice for local development.
Hey guys, I've created a slack app for our internal purposes. The app has an incoming webhook which posts a message to certain channel. The message is basically a question and has five buttons named `1`, `2` and so on till `5`. Our slack users, click on a button and rate the question for which my slack endpoint in our application responds with an `ephemeral` response telling the user the rating they have given in a new message.
What I really want to do is, I want to update the original question with the response message and not a new message.
And it should be ephemeral.
<@U1KH878SJ>: I believe that as you originally posted “public” that can not be changed afterwards
The original message can be updated as is visible in the documentation.
That I'm sure about.
yes
but no the type of message
"Once a message has been issued, it will retain its visibility quality for life."
<https://api.slack.com/docs/message-buttons>
The whole point is to post the response message just right next to the original question.
Yes, I read that.
That works as expected.
Suppose, in the time user clicked on an action button, a new question came in from the webhook, the response to the previous question will be posted after the 2nd question which is not what I want.
I see what you mean now .. and unfortunately I dont have a suggestion on how to solve that
unless in your “ephemeral” response you make a reference to the original question
check the time between question and response and if it is too long you can “assume” that there was more activity in the channel
<@U0JPS3SHX>: I did a work around. I removed the `ephemeral` condition from it, and now I am updating the original question with `original_message` and attached a new element to `attachments` key which serves the purpose of response.
It looks fine now.
<@U1KH878SJ>: but visible to everyone right ?
yes, that's correct.
since the visibility can't be changed, I talked to my boss if it could remain public and they agreed.
since there's nothing we can do to change it.
Hey, can someone know why when i try to start my slack bot in my local machine (in my job) i get error ETIMEDOUT when getting a message from channel?
I haven't been able to interact with the bot.
he crashes right after
  syscall: 'connect',
address: '54.230
port: 443 } undefined
:face_with_rolling_eyes:
<@U1LQ3C9CG>: <https://github.com/ben/botkit-shell>
Also <@U1KMM2FE1> :point_up::skin-tone-3:
<@U1BPBKXK5>: Neat, thanks for saving me the work :thumbsup: 
I hacked it together on an airplane. It's not _quite_ as nice as the Hubot one (yet), but it works.
<@U1BPBKXK5>: Thanks, I will give it a try and provide feedback!
That would be much appreciated, thanks!
does anyone know if an event is triggered when a link in a message or attachment is clicked?
no
an event is not triggered
<@U04SM6T2H>: thank you. so there is no way right now to track this kind of user engagement?
you'd need to use a referrer id or some other kind of tracking redirect
yup.. there's no way right now, but we're adding link tracking to <http://dashbot.io|dashbot.io> soon.
<@U04SM6T2H> <@U0F7LRC5A>: it would be really useful if slack added message impression and click tracking events to the platform api
having clients use shorteners or other workarounds can leak information
I am sure they both agree with that
Anyone able to help with a botkit question?
I am trying to download an image that is posted in a private message channel to a slack bot, but can't figure out how to get it without getting a login page
<@U1MFS4T9S> a whole channel <#C0AV5N8NA> awaits!
Thanks!
Hi, which channel would be the best to ask about questions regarding slack api (and specifically the RTM part)?
<http://www.tamedia.ch/en/media-centre/press-releases/2016/pressrelease/doodle_is_taking_over_the_chatbot_scheduling_assistant_meekan/>
Congrats <@U055FHACC>!!!
congrats <@U055FHACC> and Meekan!  hopefully you guys can help explore how user experience should work when you're mixing conversational and web UI interactions
Wow, amazing news, well done <@U055FHACC> &amp; the Meekan team :clap: This will get our VCs excited :wink:
.I am getting this error ` Error: API call "chat.attachmentAction" not ok(…)` in chrome console, while trying to click on interactive message button. in slack...any idea on what could be wrong
Well … what is your code?
I have just sent a test message given in the doc  <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-buttons>
<@U055FHACC> congrats :slightly_smiling_face:
is that the first decent bot acquisition?
Woot! Great news <@U055FHACC> :slightly_smiling_face: congratulations!
<@U0HUNC8PR>: Are you sending the message from a Slack app that has an action URL configured for it in the application's settings? If you're posting the message from a custom integration _not_ wrapped in a Slack app, the buttons may display (both in the message builder and in Slack) but they will not be functional (they won't be connected to an action to invoke)
Hello team, would ambient type work for interactive messages ? I see currently it works for direct_message, has anyone tried.. any inputs please ?
is there a channel for interactive messages ?
I cant find one
also I'd like to print all the values that we receive from an interactive button , does anyone know how we can read them ?
<@U07CW6N3A>: thanks for reply..i indeed used slackapp, ...
Hello people, I just published this

hope you find it interesting
Hello, may I ask for someone to suggest a bot that can communicate with a cloud based database?
<@U1LPGS4P8>: like as in example code?
there's not really any difference between a database in the cloud and locally
So, I feel like seeing the code or experience the bot itself would help give me an outline of what I need to do to set one up…?
I basically need guidance. I just learned what Git is and how it works, conceptually. I don't know how to use it, yet. Although Github made it really easy to understand...
it depends on what language you're using I guess (although technically the way to go about it is pretty much the same) but I'd probably start by learning one thing at a time as to not overwhelm yourself and to make sure you understand what it is and why you're doing what you're doing
I have experience with python to the extent of a few college level classes and almost all of the free online tutorials.
Slack has a lot of resources on how their API's work. I figured I would need a cloud based database system that offers API's?
My thoughts are that it's up to me to write the code to connect Slack and this database...
I planned to use heroku or codenvy to “host” the program. (in quotes bc I'm not sure if that's what it's called)
You also need to figure out what kind of database will suit your needs the best, NoSQL (document, key/value) or SQL etc
Again, another assumption, but I figured Cloud based would be the most efficient way of setting it up.
But, if I must, I will dive into SQL as well..
You could always try out firebase. Not the best for all applications and its data structure is a little weird compared to others. But there is a storage module for botkit with it
he's using python though :slightly_smiling_face:
oh right
i wasnt paying attention, thought i was still in the botkit channel
What language would I need to use it? I have some experience with HTML and JS as well
you can use firebase with python
it's just botkit is a framework for JS
Ah, okay.
So, theoretically, I can use botkit and still communicate with SQL or something else?
yeah, sure
What would you recommend as next step? Get a better understanding of JS, and is there a quantitative amount of JS I need to learn to use botkit?
it's up to you how you want to write your bot, python is just as fine for it :slightly_smiling_face: I'd recommend learning how to communicate with a database and then learn how to write a bot, then use your knowledge to write a bot that communicates with a database
Got it, thanks! I'll have to see if SQL or NoSQL is a better fit.
I have some college course experience with python as well. I'm using botkit tho, which requires JS knowledge. I recommend at least taking the codeacademy course on javascript before deep diving botkit
from a noob perspective, it helped me substantially
re: storage: my needs aren't that substantial, so I just use redis
since there is a module in botkit for that
and heroku has a free redis add-on for testing
Is there an equivalent to redis in python?
I believe you can use redis with python
I have more knowledge of python as it is, it may be more efficient for me to stick with that.
redis
well, I guess I don't have enough
hah
:slightly_smiling_face: it's all good. I'd chart out your expectations for the bot
oh, it's not code. It's like a plugin?
yeah, redis is storage
heroku has it as an add on
and will provide the URL/etc to connect to it in your code
I'm using botkit, so I just use the redis.js module
Ah okay. I'm reading about it on their website. So this would be used instead of something like SQL?
there is a python redis package as well
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redis>
Fantastic, thanks!
<@U0XRM115M>: Are you suggesting that I use redis instead of SQL?
depends on your needs, I use redis with heroku because it is simpler for my bot. honestly, I'd read up on the pros/cons of each to see which matches your needs
hello <@U1LPGS4P8>, check out <#C0J3CL5V1> if you haven't done so already
Thanks for the advice, everyone! I really appreciate it. I'm on codecademy doing SQL tutorials.
<@U0CNYC404>: looks like it's a first, yes :slightly_smiling_face:
Hey Guys: If your team is using Howdy bot, we are collecting beta teams for a new round of features, check it out over in <#C0J4J90NM>  EDIT: corrected channel!
tako: Redis is a key/value store with extras- it doesn't provide real relational persistence the way an SQL store does.  They each have their strengths and there is a bit of overlap in functionality.  The other thing about redis is it's bloody fast and schemaless, so you can get your app off the ground more quickly.
<@U0HUTFBHS>: Fantastic info, thanks!
<@U1LPGS4P8>: I hope you have fun on your upcoming adventures in persistence.  :slightly_smiling_face:
It's overwhelming, and exciting at the same time. I just have to keep pushing when I get stuck.
Just wondering if I can have the same server have endpoints for both a facebookbot and slackbit, or do they need to be separate instances?
I'm using howdy's botkit btw
Right now they need to be separate
That's fine I guess, using now.sh, shouldn't be hard
Hello everyone, now after i integrate my website RSS with slack to display new feeds , can i change the way and the format of new feeds that displayed in slack channel? , can i make new format or style to dispaly this feeds ?
Hey, How can i upload gif to slack? i was able to upload only text files.
Throw the image into the link bit and it works for me.
