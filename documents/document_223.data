hello all
i am just starting to learn elm
and i follow the official guide and try to add helpers to my form
what can i do for checking a type of a var?
<https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/forms.html>
Add an additional field for age and check that it is a number.
i am trying to doing that
but no idea and dont find doc about that
well it's going to be handed back as a string, so attempting to convert it to an in will fail if its not a valid int
Look in the strings package
using toString ?
`String.toInt` ?
right and its going to give you a Result which is either a valid Int or an error
<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/String#toInt>
you need to handle both the case where it succeeds as well as when it fails.
<https://guide.elm-lang.org/error_handling/result.html>
wow not really clear
how to get the Err value
it's an algebraic data type or union type, the link <@U1AN4JRFV>  gave shows how you extract the types with a case statement
well, one way to extract the info
