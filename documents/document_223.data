U04SM6T2H : you should post on the github repo
U04SM6T2H : there is definitely value in a "Good enough" self-hostable nlp api
U3ES7AM6X : <@U04SM6T2H> yup, I dont want to be a jerk. honesty with compassion.
U3ES7AM6X : There is. That's why I was looking at it.
U272P5K71 : Example thread reply! :tada:
U3U1Q8K0A : hey all. Built a slackbot and use the RTM API but it i want to be able to tell if the message is from the bot or someone else
U3U1Q8K0A : i would have thought there would be a method for me to look up my user id but there doesnt seem to be
U1YBHHRD4 : your user information (along with everyone else's) is sent in the `rtm.start` response
U1YBHHRD4 : You should be able to just compare it with the incoming message's user ID.
U3U1Q8K0A : im using `sc.rtm_connect()` from python.. wonder if calling the api call too will mess that up
U3U1Q8K0A : ```x = sc.api_call("rtm.start")print x['self']['id']``` seems to work

U3U1Q8K0A : thanks
U3U7G58P6 : hello
U3UD6RY59 : Hey everyone! Dan from RadBots here, happy to join and help support however I can. :slightly_smiling_face:
U3UKQCFM1 : Hey guys, I have a question about posting attachments to channels via a Python slackbot. What channel should I head to?
U3H7PR52P : <@U3UKQCFM1> I'd try <#C0J3CL5V1|language-python>
U3NFQN97H : Hey guys, when you are hosting your slack app/bot, how do you filter requests to just ones from slack IPs? As far as i can tell, slack doesn't have a list of IPs for their requests to whitelist and allow through a firewall....
U3NFQN97H : or if anyone can point me to the right channel to ask that Q, that would be much appreciated :smile:
U0HUTFBHS : <@U3NFQN97H> I handle that via team authentication, IP addresses are not a great way to handle auth these days.  I'm sure they're hosted on some sort of elastic infrastructure.
U0U32UM43 : <@U3NFQN97H> According to <https://twitter.com/slackapi/status/567110311476350976>, Slack does not have static IP addresses, so they recommend checking the token that is sent along w/ other details to verify the request is actually from Slack. Depending on whether you're app/bot is listening for a webhook or an event, the format is slightly different. See <https://api.slack.com/events-api#receiving_events> for events api, and <https://api.slack.com/outgoing-webhooks> for outgoing webhooks.
U3U82GWQ0 : Question, anyone using AWS Lambda for hosting commands and bots for slack? I would like to know the challenges and recommendations
U0HUTFBHS : umeshshah Yes, I'm doing that at the moment.
U1ZMN2FD1 : is it possible to delete a channel without first archiving it?
U0GT29N3A : <@U1ZMN2FD1> There is no API method to delete a channel: you can only archive I believe.
U1ZMN2FD1 : so that would also mean it can't be done via a client, right?
U1ZMN2FD1 : i'm asking because a channel disappeared from a team that has my app installed, but i didn't receive a `channel_archive` event, which i thought would be necessary before deletion
U1ZMN2FD1 : unfortunately i'm not subscribed to `channel_delete`
U0KNN1SBV : Hi bot builders I'm in SF from Feb 5th - 11th Anyone up for a meet to share learnings on building slack bots?
U3W32JY06 : Hi, I am Rama from Palo Alto - just released a Slack bot - it is private beta. Have learned a lot from this process and would love to share what I have learned and learning from the experience. One question: What are your best tips for doing user testing with a bot? How do you do user testing without needing to get the team admin to install the bot on the team directory? Thanks!
U0LLUCLP3 : I look forward to discussing implementation of this new innovation with you all!:<https://twitter.com/jay_bee12345/status/823730131340431360>

U0LLUCLP3 : <https://www.amazon.com/Dash-Buttons/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=10667898011>
U0LLUCLP3 : I think this will be great for families (FB Messenger) and Work Teams (Slack) and General Use (Twitter).Anyone care to weigh-in with their valued perspective?

U0LLUCLP3 : Ideally integrated into SMS!
U0V93GE5R : Um what does this have to do with bot building 
U0LLUCLP3 : My mistake... I thought this was the Slack Developer Hangout (formerly).
U0LLUCLP3 : <@U0V93GE5R> Idea for Amazon Dash Slack Bot: A bot that takes specific new emojis (dash buttons) as command lines for a link to the amazon product webpage...This way these specific new emojis have a amazon product webpage associated with them.
For fun and functionality, assign specific existing emojis as commands lines for links to other amazon products webpages:
Ideally these new amazon product page assignments to emojis will be transferrable among Slack &amp; All Forums (FB &amp; TWT).
Example:
:bulb:

U3WCMQ2F8 : Hey, just wondering, does anyone noticed an issue with message buttons not rendering on iOS in certain case with the last release ?
U21U8SZ2P : <@U3W32JY06> one thing we did for user testing was have a real human basically pretending to be the bot on the other side
U3FGRUSLT : ```I had this idea for a new slash command, /note &lt;data&gt; so you could leave private notes about a person and retrieve them at a later date. My use case is I run a school with 100s of students and I am having trouble remembering which student is on a mac or pc, which student did this or that, I want as I learn the information with the student during a direct im conversation to quickly record little notes like:
/note mac
/note lives on east cost
/note knows php well

and then if I type /note without anything i get:

mac, lives on east cost, knows php well

displayed to me and only me in the im conversation.```

U3FGRUSLT : should I build that or does anyone know if that already exists? thanks!
U0HBN0L9M : like this ?
U0HBN0L9M : <http://slack.com/apps/A0SPKPAQ3--notes|slack.com/apps/A0SPKPAQ3--notes>
U3FGRUSLT : hehe perfect, thanks <@U0HBN0L9M>
U0D1YNBEE : matthieu: that's neat :slightly_smiling_face:
U3W32JY06 : Thanks <@U21U8SZ2P>
U3U82GWQ0 : How would you update the notes?
U3U82GWQ0 : nice idea
U3FGRUSLT : i installed it and got this message: ```_ /notes john is a true leader _ Appends *john is a true leader* to your current channel's notepad• _ /notes [title] john is a true leader _ Appends *john is a true leader* under the *title* notepad. *Brackets are required*
• _ /notes list _ Shows your notes for the channel you are in
• _ /notes list [title] _ Shows your notes for the specified *title*.
• _ /notes list all _ Lists all your notes, grouped by channel
• _ /notes clear _ Clears all your notes for the current channel. *They can't be retrieved*
• _ /notes clear [title] _ Clears all your notes saved under the *title* notepad. *They can't be retrieved*
• _ /notes undo _ Removes your latest note for the current channel. Your latest appended message will be deleted
• _ /notes undo [title] _ Removes your latest note for the *title* notepad. Your latest appended message will be deleted
• _ /notes help _ Displays this list of commands
• _ /notes feedback I love /notes! _ Sends a message saying *I love /notes!*. Tell me what you think and help me make /notes better!```
