Alternatively, say I'm using a list to represent a stack of things, I could `type alias Stack a = List a`, where `a` just means it's not constrained to any specific type. If I were to say `type alias Stack = List String`, You don't need a variable because a `Stack` will _always_ be a list of strings.
