U64MJCDNH : sorry I'm newbie in python. Can I add this in while loope whith if, and when certain time has passed to call my function for new key ?
U5LNXQHN3 : Before the loop, when you get the token for the first time: `start_time = time.time()`
U5LNXQHN3 : And in the loop, before each request:```
if time.time() - start_time &gt;= 7200:
    api_key()
```

U5LNXQHN3 : You'll probably want a value lower than 7200 anyway, because waiting until the last second means you might get a failed request at the end
U64MJCDNH : kylotan, thank you.
U5LNXQHN3 : (also, test it with a number like 60, so you don't have to wait 2 hours to see if it's correct or not!)
U5LNXQHN3 : No problem.
U5CGPBF0U : So, configuring a Python app to use gunicorn on Heroku, the docs show `web: gunicorn hello:app` for the example Procfile but doesn't really explain what `hello:app` represents. Is it `&lt;class&gt;:&lt;method&gt;` or something like that?
U64MJCDNH : <@U5LNXQHN3> Of course. Thank's :wink:
U0L8Y8ZEW : <@U5CGPBF0U> I'm guessing it is probably module:function
U64MJCDNH : <@U5LNXQHN3> Do you have some idea ?I added start_time variable before loop, and added this in loop. My loop now looks:
```while True:
        if time.time() - start_time &gt;= 60:
            get_key()

        time.sleep(15)```
When I start script, after 60 seconds scripts run get_key function what is good, but then on after each 15 second again.

U5LNXQHN3 : ah, of course. you'll need to reset start_time to time.time whenever you get a new key.
U64MJCDNH : I supposed, but how I can to do that in this if statement ?
U64MJCDNH : <@U5LNXQHN3>
U64MJCDNH : Can I only to add again ```start_time = time.time()``` in this if statement ?
U5LNXQHN3 : yes
U64MJCDNH : cool !
U5LNXQHN3 : you could probably improve the code by setting that time inside the get_key function, so that you don't need it in the if statement
U64MJCDNH : yes, I thinking about that. Thank you <@U5LNXQHN3> I will test !
U5CGPBF0U : If I run `python manage.py db init` on my server it works, but then I run `python manage.py db migrate` and I get `Path doesn't exist: 'migrations'. Please use the 'init' command...`. :neutral_face:
U5CGPBF0U : Not sure what I'm doing wrong.
U5NMSURAQ : is there a directory named migrations after init?
U5NMSURAQ : `app/migrations`...
U5NMSURAQ : maybe it was expected in the root directory
