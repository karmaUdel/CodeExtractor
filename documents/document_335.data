                    ( updatedModel, Cmd.none )```
because I have a large code block to update the nested model for every "SomeValueChanged" message, and only the line actually assigning the new value ever changes
actually I'm just stupid
I had a `=` in the lambda function that should be a `-&gt;`
<@U6531GSTW> yeah it seems like thats malformed json
<@U23SA861Y> <https://jsonblob.com/6ecd993e-6290-11e7-ae4c-e793fe90c432>
used on this code <https://ellie-app.com/3HGC3s98j2xa1/4>
looks alright, but I think you might be reading the wrong file maybe?
can i link this url to the elm code?
or what do you mean by "wrong file"
this part of update reads the json link etc. :
            ( { model | show = "Error:  " ++ (toString error) }, Cmd.none )
heh, doesn't that link to the html page not the raw json blob
yes how can i upload such a raw json?
umm, well you need a server to host it. you do it through github maybe
