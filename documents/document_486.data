U39DE7RQ9 : <@U48AEBJQ3> thanks, I will try that!
U39DE7RQ9 : <@U48AEBJQ3>, now that code seems to compile. The next problem is that in my subscriptions I need to point to messages that resides in my HomePage module. The compiler says:```
23:08:12 client.1   |  The type annotation for `subscriptions` says it always returns:
23:08:12 client.1   |      Sub Msg
23:08:12 client.1   |  But the returned value (shown above) is a:
23:08:12 client.1   |      Sub HomePage.Msg
```

U39DE7RQ9 : I know it is possible to map messages some how but I cant find how.
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U39DE7RQ9> <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Platform-Sub#map>
U48AEBJQ3 : You need something of `HomePage.Msg -&gt; Msg`
U48AEBJQ3 : Usually a constructor of `Msg`
U39DE7RQ9 : <@U48AEBJQ3> a function that encapsulates HomePage.Msg in a Msg?
U48AEBJQ3 : Right, usually a tag of `Msg`
```
type Msg
   ...
   | SubscriptionEvent HomePage.Msg
```

U39DE7RQ9 : Im sorry <@U48AEBJQ3> but I cannot seem to puzzle this out by my self. I have added `SubscriptionEvent HomePage.Msg` message but my subscriptions look like this tight now and it does not compile.```
subscriptions : Model -&gt; Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
    Sub.batch
        [ gotAllPublicForms (SubscriptionEvent (HomePage.GotAllPublicFormsMsg &lt;&lt; decodeValue jsonFormListDecoder))
        , gotForm (SubscriptionEvent (HomePage.GotFormMsg &lt;&lt; decodeValue jsonFormDecoder))
        ]
```

U39DE7RQ9 : My ports look like this:``` 
port getAllPublicForms : () -&gt; Cmd msg
port gotAllPublicForms : (Json.Decode.Value -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg
port getForm : FormId -&gt; Cmd msg
port gotForm : (Json.Decode.Value -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg
```

U39DE7RQ9 : The compiler says:``` 
23:44:13 client.1   |  267|           gotAllPublicForms (SubscriptionEvent (HomePage.GotAllPublicFormsMsg &lt;&lt; decodeValue jsonFormListDecoder)
23:44:13 client.1   |                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
23:44:13 client.1   |  Function `gotAllPublicForms` is expecting the argument to be:
23:44:13 client.1   |      Value -&gt; Msg
23:44:13 client.1   |  But it is:
23:44:13 client.1   |      Msg
```

U48AEBJQ3 : <@U39DE7RQ9> There are different places to tackle this from. I think from how you are doing it here, you need `gotAllPublicForms (SubscriptionEvent &lt;&lt; HomePage.GotAllPublicFormsMsg &lt;&lt; decodeValue jsonFormListDecoder)`
U69D8R59S : Good way to call a function N times? In my specific case, I'm trying to simulate a dice roll by updating my model with random values for a few seconds.
U153UK3FA : <@U69D8R59S> calling a function N times really depends on what you want to do with the N results
U153UK3FA : do you want a list of these results?
U69D8R59S : I want to replace a property on my model N times
U153UK3FA : ah, wanting to animate a die face by having it transition between numbers?
U69D8R59S : Yes, exactly! :slightly_smiling_face:
U153UK3FA : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-style-animation/latest> is nice for doing animation
U69D8R59S : Thank you. I think I can see a way to use animation to fit my needs.
As a different challenge, what would be a good way to accomplish this without animation? Let's say my view was simply displaying a value from my model, and elsewhere in my application, that value was being updated N times every second or so.

U69D8R59S : I can see a way in JavaScript: a loop with setTimeout. But the paradigm shift has been challenging for me. I'm mostly curious for the education.
U153UK3FA : You'd likely have a subscription to `Time.every` and have a case in your `update` that produced a Cmd from `Random.generate` and a another case to update the model with the result of that Cmd
U153UK3FA : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Time#every>
U153UK3FA : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Random#generate>
U69D8R59S : With that method, are you envisioning an additional property to track when N operations has been reached--since `Time.every` would run indefinitely
U153UK3FA : yep
U153UK3FA : and you just drop the subscription once you've reached that number
U69D8R59S : Excellent. Thank you very much!
U1ZFF0E5P : can someone explain to me the following: ```&gt; (,)&lt;function&gt; : a -&gt; b -&gt; ( a, b )
&gt; (,,)
&lt;function&gt; : a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; ( a, b, c )
```
the `(,)` or `(,,)` part is special elm syntax right? or is it like say `map7` and has only a finite amount of them defined?

U1ZFF0E5P : (can't seem to find anything in elm-core)
U153UK3FA : there is a finite amount of them
U153UK3FA : `(,,,,,,,,)` is the limit
U153UK3FA : it's also special syntax and not a definable operator
U57KYFW67 : Are there any packages which expose access to local storage?
U153UK3FA : <@U57KYFW67> <https://github.com/elm-lang/projects/blob/master/roadmap.md#where-is-the-localstorage-package>
U57KYFW67 : tyty
U2DF486HL : Hi, in my elm app I use this kind of Routes "/#/myroute". Can I start my app with one of this routes?Bear in mind that my app entrypoint is a url like "/pathto/elmView/" in django, from where I take some flags for initialization

U1ZFF0E5P : you want to use a program from the Navigation package
