U5LFUHH19 : I would like to go from `Dict String a` to `Dict String (List a)` or something where I have all the values together.
U23SA861Y : right so then you need merge for that
U23SA861Y : ```Dict.merge
    (\key a -&gt; Dict.insert key [a])
    (\key a b -&gt; Dict.insert key [a,b])
   (\key b -&gt; Dict.insert key [b])
  first
  second
  Dict.empty
```

U5LFUHH19 : Why are there two `result`s at the end of `merge`?
U3SJEDR96 : `Dict.merge (\key val dict -&gt; Dict.insert key [ val ]) (\key val otherVal dict -&gt; Dict.insert key [ val otherVal dict ]) (\key val dict -&gt; Dict.insert key [ val ]) leftDict rightDict Dict.empty`
U3SJEDR96 : the first one is your "initial" result, much like you have with foldl and foldr
U3SJEDR96 : the second is your return value
U5LFUHH19 : Oh!
U5LFUHH19 : Makes sense now.
U2LAL86AY : elm reactor doesn't work with native modules??

U0EUHKVGB : your native code does not match your project name
U2LAL86AY : my project name is `elm-pdf`
U2LAL86AY : so it will look like this:
U2LAL86AY : `_user$elm-pdf$Native`
U2LAL86AY : ?
U0EUHKVGB : dashes are replaced by underscores
U2LAL86AY : ah :smile:!
U0EUHKVGB : the user and package come from your repo url in your elm package file 
U0EUHKVGB : <@U2LAL86AY> =&gt; <#C0K9JFCKV|native>
U5QV0AZM3 : Is there a Svg to Fast Svg converter?
U0EUHKVGB : ?
U0EUHKVGB : <@U5QV0AZM3> what do you mean by fast svg?
U5AQ585NH : Yay! Just figured out how to make reusable widgets. Updated repo. Tomorrow will try to create package from it.
U5QV0AZM3 : <@U0EUHKVGB> elm-lang/svg, my friend sent me a SVG and I wanted to put it in Elm Svg directly without converting it manually
U0EUHKVGB : one sec
U0EUHKVGB : <https://gist.github.com/eeue56/d0ab060828bf3b64922ac9172ee430c3>
U0EUHKVGB : change `example.svg` to the name of your file
U0EUHKVGB : on this line: <https://gist.github.com/eeue56/d0ab060828bf3b64922ac9172ee430c3#file-xml_to_elm-py-L56>
U0EUHKVGB : `output.elm` will contain the svg.
U5AQ585NH : <@U0J1M0F32> this one <https://github.com/inkuzmin/elm-multiselect>
U5QV0AZM3 : <@U0EUHKVGB> no way!!! Thank you so much :slightly_smiling_face:
U0EUHKVGB : or, you can just try this if you don’t want to convert it at all to elm-svg: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/4482962/2985975>
U5QV0AZM3 : <@U0EUHKVGB> Gonna try both even if the second one seems smarter! Thank you
U3SJEDR96 : <@U5QV0AZM3> also, <https://mbylstra.github.io/html-to-elm/> _might_ support SVG
U5ABF3BH7 : I get autoinput now, but still having trouble figuring out how to make the search and select together to create a select2 type dropdown ( single entry)
U5LFUHH19 : Re: merging a `List (Dict String a) -&gt; Dict String (List a)`: <http://lpaste.net/3343297668142071808>
U5LFUHH19 : Some commentary in there.  I think I figured it out, but I was hoping to confirm my suspicions.  Basically I think I need to first change my `List (Dict String a)` to `List (Dict String (List a))`
U5LFUHH19 : I tried variations on the "merge" argument where the `key` is found in both Dicts where I assumed that the `a` is a `List` and so did `a ++ [b]` but that won't even compile.
U23SA861Y : you want a function which goes  from List (Dict key a) to Dict key (List a) correct?
U23SA861Y : <https://ellie-app.com/3yD7XSLcDHna1/0>
U23SA861Y : <https://ellie-app.com/3yD7XSLcDHna1/1>
U23SA861Y : <@U5LFUHH19> ^
U5LFUHH19 : Woah!  That works!  <https://ellie-app.com/3yD9JfQC9rfa1/0>
U5LFUHH19 : OK, I'm seeing my mistake(s).
U5LFUHH19 : Thansk, <@U23SA861Y>
U0JFGGZS6 : <@U5ABF3BH7>  here's a select2-ish thing just posted yesterday
U2LAL86AY : how i'm supposed to use the DOM?
U2LAL86AY : ```
myButton : Html Float
myButton =
  button
    [ on "click" (target offsetWidth) ]
    [ text "Click me!" ]
```
I need Html Msg not Html Float :smile: What html Float even means in terms of elm architecture?

U2LAL86AY : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/MichaelCombs28/elm-dom/1.0.0/DOM#target>
U23SA861Y : well if you had only one single message type Float then you could use that, but otherwise you need to map in a message constructor of type (Float -&gt; Msg)
U2LAL86AY : so i need to use `Json.map MyMessageTag` and then this code.. ok that makes sense. thanks :thumbsup:
U3S3S7J06 : is there a way to deconstruct a type and have the type assigned? like `Point 3 4` used in the way `(Point x y) = pt = Point 3 4`
U3S3S7J06 : or is it just accept `pt` and deconstruct in the function?
U0H3A9XLN : You can do it using pattern matching
U0H3A9XLN : Or, if you have only 1 union type you can deconstruct within arguments 
U2LAL86AY : how do i read the width of the parent of an element? what ii have right now is: ` on "click" &lt;| Json.map (ReceiveWidthOfParent id) &lt;| DOM.parentElement &lt;| DOM.offsetWidth `
But there are no msg shown.

U2LAL86AY : for the element itself i can get the width using:` on "click" &lt;| Json.map (ReceiveWidthOfParent id) &lt;| DOM.target &lt;| DOM.offsetWidth`
