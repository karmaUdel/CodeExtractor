        |&gt; Json.Decode.Pipeline.required "activeColor" (Json.Decode.array arrayAsTuple3)```
What am i doing wrong here :confused:?
can't work out how to feed the information correctly into arrayAsTuple
You can just use `arrayAsTuple3 (index 0 int) (...) (..)` there.
ah
perfect
Of you can change the tupledecoder so that it will do the indexing by itself (by "wrapping" the decoders with the relevant `index x`), so you could just call `arrastup3 int int string` or whatever :)
ah ok
thank you!
(on mobile so being a little terse, sorry ;))
dude, hero, no sweat
