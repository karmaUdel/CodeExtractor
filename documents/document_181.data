<@U0L8LLD99> thanks!
hi..i was wondering how i can host a bot on microsoft azure. I used the python SDK to build the bot
Thanks Guys,
Hi, there ! Happy new year :tada:
Did someone else also noticed that image_url in a message seems to be cached ? when you update the url with a new image and post a new message with the same url referred by image_url, the previous image is displayed as it was cached by slack and not the expected new one
and to you too! if your'e interested in opportunities, # the people foundry ... so I can find you! or DirectMessage Me
Works fine. Thank you Wojtek Borowic.
Is there a way to attach an image in a Slack conversation that shows up like I'd send an image in a text message – without the option to download, or without the link to the original URL? Or, is it designed this way as a founding principle of transparency or sorts for Slack?

<@U0GT29N3A> Thank you Julian. That's what I'm currently doing – but that allows someone to download the image, and get the URL (by right clicking copy URL). I'm thinking this may be the way "Slack does things" and I just need to get used to it. :slightly_smiling_face:
Doesn't Slack download your image and host it on their own? Are you sure the URL from the right click &gt; copy URL is yours?
that's how slack does things :slightly_smiling_face: you can also unfurl a media link, though
<@U0GT29N3A> Yes, and yes. First yes: they do this for caching it locally. eg. there is no way for me to reload their cache, solution is to use a different URL. Second yes: if I right click copy URL I can confirm it's mine
<@U0HBN0L9M> thank you, what does "unfurl" mean? :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U07CW6N3A> From the Slack docs I learned about ngrok. This tool is so awesome. Thanks again for linking me to that a while back. I believe it was the slackclient guide
unfurl means take a url, make an http get request to it, grab the title, image etc and put that in the message vs. just the www dot blah text
<@U3FGRUSLT> thank you, is that with an attachment image_url ? Or is there something I'm missing here? HMm
i love this title: <https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-unfurling-but-were-afraid-to-ask-or-how-to-make-your-e64b4bb9254#.vr4jloltg>
btw there is 1 special url that slack never unfurls
let see if it still works:

I wrote this Medium piece for HubSpot's ThinkGrowth publication. Thought people here might find it interesting <https://thinkgrowth.org/building-on-slack-saved-our-startup-94953fdaf27a#.1u3nkug1r>
Good post <@U0HRQBPE1> I'd like to see Slack and other Platforms however, disclose the companies they invest in, when producing "industry" landscape-type charts that are picked up by the media - because they give their portfolio companies an unfair advantage when promoting them over competitors.
<@U1DDKQPGB> I agree with that and good point. Always a classy move when writing _anything_ to disclose if you're an investor or advisor.
i'm an investor in HDT :slightly_smiling_face: i wrote this last night about code schools and major CS depts <https://higher.team/blog/2017/january/does-not-offer-yet>
Not "developer" related aside from this type of article potentially encouraging brands to build bots through agencies who outsource to developers :slightly_smiling_face: <http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/01/06/what-why-and-how-chatbots-brands> And interview I did with a very respectable publication in the UK. I gave a shoutout to a few companies.
<@U3FGRUSLT> Aha! Thank you
Is there a way to get a Slack bot to only allow itself to be in 1 channel? eg. can a slack bot decline an invite into a new channel? If not, I suppose I can have the bot leave if it joins a channel and is already in one via channels.leave
<@U3KHRQLTX> last i checked bots couldn't use channels.leave
they can't join or leave channels on their own
<@U04SM6T2H> Thank you. I could set it so the bot only works in 1 channel, or the last channel it was invited to... but it'd be a better experience if I had some control here.
yeah
<@U07CW6N3A> <@U1HK4CCRM> Happen to know if it's possible for a bot to reject an invite to a channel, or not join a channel, or leave a channel? I want to limit my bot to being in 1 channel. I can set it up so my bot is only active in the last channel it was invited to if needed, but I wanted to check with you guys first. Thanks
<@U3KHRQLTX> -- from a pure bot perspective, no -- you'd need to just choose to ignore (or respond with a rote message) messages/events associated with "other" channels -- that's probably not an awesome experience though.          I don't recall there being a "kick" method even from a user perspective, so there's no sidebar way to do that through the vehicle of the installing user's access token and an associated scope...
Ultimately, I'd think hard about how you may want someone to install it in only one channel, but a user might want another thing and the platform -- at least at this time -- doesn't provide you an easy means to enforce that. So it may be best to just go with the flow here and allow being in multiple channels, even if you consider only one "primary". But if a user has a good reason to install you in channel XYZ while you're also installed in channel ABC (maybe this user isn't a member of _that_ channel), then maybe your app has a good reason to support both use cases.
<@U07CW6N3A> Thank you for the thoughtful answer – I appreciate it. I'll rethink this process a bit, I can allow for flexibility. :slightly_smiling_face:
hello all! just wanted to say hi to this community :slightly_smiling_face:

Anybody have any ideas if the user_change event is triggered when a user joins the team? 
Wow, I found team_join lol 
On a side note, is there any example expected output of the team_join event? All I see is:
