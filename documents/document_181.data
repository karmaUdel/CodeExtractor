U0CS7U85R : <@U0HBN0L9M>: it's via rtm + chat.update web api and doesn't require the browser plugin. Basically a server process detects if a registered user posted 'something' and then instantly adds the reply link... (and also updates the original thread with the reply count)
U0CS7U85R : in a way, it's like smooz (pretty cool btw), where instead of crossposting to a different team upon detecting the match, it just updates the original message.<http://talkhq.com/reply/ID9CmBWYJt3X-kedIKH1dJm14aKpXcRTuAR0NF_LW6ydL_qXyV50K-85DD-qKVz9U|reply> in <http://talkhq.com/view/IhFxdg8mO098FIHa4PiDq4ZvgpVnNIob-aHAFtRlwBD_|thread>

U0GP30PPF : <@U0JNW26JG>: you have some weird quotes in there
U0GP30PPF : curly quotes
U0GP30PPF : that's not valid json
U0GP30PPF : ah, it's the closing quotemark after thumb.png
U0GP30PPF : if you replace that with the proper `"` it looks right to me
U0JNW26JG : Oops it's this one: `[{"fallback":"ReferenceError - UI is not defined: <https://honeybadger.io/path/to/event/%22,%22text%22:%22&lt;https://honeybadger.io/path/to/event/%7CReferenceError&gt;> - UI is not defined","fields":[{"title":"Project","value":"Awesome Project","short":true},{"title":"Environment","value":"production","short":true}],"color":"#F35A00”}]`
U0JNW26JG : Seems right  to me
U0GP30PPF : hrm, have you tried wrapping that whole thing in an:
U0GP30PPF : ```
U0GP30PPF : er, sorry
U0GP30PPF : premature enter
U0GP30PPF : ```{
"attachments": $yourpastehere
}
```

U0GP30PPF : so it's like `{ "attachments": [ { "fallback": ..... } ] }`
U0GP30PPF : the honeybadger example from the attachments page shows it like that
U0GP30PPF : but i'm unsure how that intersects with using form encoded fields in the web api..
U0GP30PPF : confusing
U0JNW26JG : tried that as well, no results :disappointed:
U0JNW26JG : am I reading over something in the docs?
U07VCKRUK : are you url encoding the attachments string?  (it looked above like you're using a GET request)
U0GP30PPF : yeah, im looking at code i found on github by searching chat.postMessage and attachments, and the prior way seemed to be right
U0GP30PPF : oh, <@U07VCKRUK> is right
