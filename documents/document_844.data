U5VGKQ2SY : better yet:burrito::coffee: <@U582KCWUB>

U582KCWUB : hehe, the :taco: should go to PyCharm, the hint this would be the issue was a tiny wheel in the project file explorer that appeared with the correct dir name :smile:
U1BP42MRS : Haha, woot jetbrains!
U5NMSURAQ : more like JetBros!
U4BMZ90T0 : I've got a dockerfile I'm creating for initializing a test database. I have the `.sql` and everything for it. Should I use a shell script to run the `.sql`?
U1BP42MRS : With python typehinting, what's the right way to show a generator return value?
U1BP42MRS : :facepalm: `typing.Generator`
U5NT83K1C : I'm using python. I have a column of time series in formate of ( ```pattern = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' ``` The datatype is Series and I need to convert it to string. I searched and I found out I need to use ```Data .astype(str) ``` to convert it to String. I used it but still that column is Series and not string. .astype() didn't convert. What's the solution. How may I do it?
U60KNBMPX : for example. You can find innumerable examples if you search "stringify python" on google
U1BP42MRS : Knit pick, you should probably consider `from __future__ import print_function` to be writing code that's compatible with the future of the language if you're writing python2
U0PKTUWKH : can somebody help me to understand where is the problem in the following statement```
        ec.create_tags(
            Resources=to_tag[retention_days],
              Tags=[
                {'Key': 'DeleteOn', 'Value': del_snap },
                {'Key': 'Created', 'Value': today },
            ]
        )
```

U0PKTUWKH : this is the error I am getting```
{
  "stackTrace": [
    [
      "/var/task/lambda_function.py",
      76,
      "lambda_handler",
      "{'Key': 'Created', 'Value': today },"
    ],
    [
      "/var/runtime/botocore/client.py",
      253,
```

U0PKTUWKH : i have a variable `today = datetime.date.today()`
U1BP42MRS : I would presume it needs to be a string
U5VGKQ2SY : comma after `today }`
U5VGKQ2SY : ?
U1BP42MRS : That's valid
U1BP42MRS : <@U0PKTUWKH> what's the other end of the stack say?
U1BP42MRS : You could try `today.isoformat()`
U0PKTUWKH : <@U1BP42MRS> <https://gist.github.com/pleegor/f82958c0755b33d96fe286d79bab8bbe>
U1BP42MRS : Yeah, on line 35
