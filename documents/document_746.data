U0LPMPL2U : this number is bigger than Elm can handle
U0LPMPL2U : The number of digits in `Infinity` is `Infinity` :smile:
U0LPMPL2U : ```&gt; (((+) 1) &lt;&lt; floor &lt;&lt; logBase 10 &lt;&lt; abs) 1000 ^ 1000
Infinity : Int
```

U3SJEDR96 : we have JS to thank for that ¯\_(?)_/¯
U5X2ZRFDF : And IEEE
U23SA861Y : be thankful it is IEEE754 compliant, because JSON is not
U3L8MM10T : Interestingly, my elm-repl (Windows10 64bit) insists I use `toFloat`: ```abs i    |&gt; toFloat
    |&gt; logBase 10
    |&gt; floor
    |&gt; (+) 1```

U0LPMPL2U : So apparently `logBase : Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float`
U0LPMPL2U : that would be why
U23SA861Y : that would make some sense
U0LPMPL2U : ```&gt; length i = abs i |&gt; logBase 10 |&gt; floor |&gt; (+) 1
&lt;function&gt; : Float -&gt; Int
```

U0LPMPL2U : this function doesn't work for decimals though:
U0LPMPL2U : ```length 3.14
1 : Int
```

U0LPMPL2U : so you may want to constrain it to only use integers
U3L8MM10T : Perhaps someone can help with the test. Do I need to import `Infinity`for `Expect.equal Infinity  (digitCount (1000^1000))` ? _Cannot find symbol "Infinity"_
U0LPMPL2U : Not sure how you can access `Infinity` directly :confused:
U0LPMPL2U : A hacky way would be to say: `Expect.equal (1000 ^ 1000)  (digitCount (1000^1000))`
U0LPMPL2U : or you could create a function:```
infinity : number
infinity =
  1000 ^ 1000
```

U3SJEDR96 : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Basics#isInfinite>
U3SJEDR96 : so `digitCount (1000 ^ 1000) |&gt; isInfinite |&gt; Expect.true "that should really be Infinite."`
U3SJEDR96 : unless digitCount returns an `Int` :sweat_smile:
U2PTZFKFX : hi, can someone explain further about Routing or Navigations?   i.e do i create different div containers to load data into ti when a next page is switched? i. e Home, About us etc??? or a different views with it's own page. I m still confused in that part.


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
	If Yes:
	1.Bad	2.Very bad
	If No:
	1.Good	2.Very good


How confident are you?
	1.Low
	2.Average
	3.High

Optional!
can you highlight place/word/sentence which lead to your decision
