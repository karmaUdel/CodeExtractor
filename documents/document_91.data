I just want to make sure I dont get this very subtle bug by implementing a protocol that's using a field versus a lookup on this, when self-referencing(?) a protocol
`field` and (:field this) will always be the same thing
i've been stabbed in the foot by javascript so many times I'm very paranoid
okay, good to know the context stays the same no matter how it's invoked
thanks <@U0NCTKEV8> <@U050MP39D>  <@U051SS2EU> :thumbsup:
