```
will give you a nice date in your code
and should i also say start : date.date
?
yep, you could do that
I don't believe dates are directly comparable but times are
so you can use the toTime function and then compare those
<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justinmimbs/elm-date-extra/2.0.3/Date-Extra#isBetween> ?
then of course you can pull in more dependencies
Or at least go and see how someone else has done it.
is this correct ? start = Data.fromString "01-11-2017"?
well Date not Data but I believe so yes
ahh nvm, it returns a result because it may not be a valid date
yes.. how do i make it a date?
by parsing the result
ahh how do i parse :smile:..
There is also <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/elm-time/1.0.7/Time-Date#date> and that package also gives you a `compare` which can be used to construct `isBetween`
yeah that date constructor would probably be helpful
yeah, I'd pull in that community package.
end = Date.fromString "16-07-2017"
umm this is false?
i just need to turn Result String Date into a date..
the data constructor in the community package avoids dealing with results and such
so what should i do now?
