I prefer not to mix side-effects with pure stuff
Someone Please suggest real-time-messaging clojure library. I might also need Screen Sharing and video chat.
jgeraert: `doseq` works great for this, but there's also `run!` which like this usage of map takes a function and a collection as args, but is run for side effects eagerly.
