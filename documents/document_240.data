U5D3HQ6R0 : ah i tend to just go back into the room and press `esc`
U57G3TP37 : Ah okay, nice!
U0GT29N3A : When this happens, shortcuts like ESC, Ctrl+K stop working (but thing like Alt + Arrow key still works). Not sure why
U4ZPQHVJR : &lt;SHIFT&gt;+&lt;ESC&gt; in the desktop clients should clear notifications - but yes, I also have that issue of "stuck" notifications
U3PCMK1AA : Is there a way to create a button so that when you click on it, it copies something into your clipboard?
U5CESNHL2 : Trying to run facebook botkit on lambda, I understand I'll need to forgo conversations without db/sessions
U5CESNHL2 : but I can't figure out how to wire up the lambda events so the right route is triggered in the controller. any ideas?
U5CESNHL2 : I've tried sifting through this example: <https://github.com/mvaragnat/botkit-messenger-express-demo>
U5CESNHL2 : ok... just pass the event.body to `handleWebhookPayload` it seems
U5CESNHL2 : that github example is doing all the heavy lifting when it should be offloading to botkit
U5CESNHL2 : ```exports.handler = (event, context, callback) =&gt; {
  const Botkit = require('botkit')
  const controller = Botkit.facebookbot({
    access_token: PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    verify_token: VERIFY_TOKEN,
  })
  const bot = controller.spawn({})

  controller.on('facebook_postback', (bot, message) =&gt; {
    const [name, data] = message.payload.split(' ')
    switch (name) {
      case 'GET_STARTED_PAYLOAD':
        return bot.reply(message, 'Welcome!')
    }
  })
  
  const body = JSON.parse(event.body)
  controller.handleWebhookPayload({body}, null, bot)
  callback(null, {statusCode: 200})
}
```

U5CESNHL2 : if anyones interested in lambda -&gt; botkit
U24AT9ZN1 : Check out <#C0HJYTUQ2|events> :wink: Just posted something interesting for bot developers!
U4FSUJLLU : is there an example for a list template for faccebook
U4FSUJLLU : why does it log ```info: ** Invalid X-HUB signature on incoming request```
U04SM6T2H : Hey folks, the BOTNESS group has organized a survey on the types of UI primitives you use and/or want to use in your bots. If you have a few moments, we'd love to get your answers to this survey -&gt; <https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/J9L92LB>
U04SM6T2H : the results will be collected and published by, I believe, Jon Bruner from the Oreilly Bots podcast
U3PCMK1AA : bug? when I get a user info using the api tester, I get an email field in the profile. But if I use the rest api, I don't, everything else is there.
U07CW6N3A : API tester tokens have maximal permissions. Using the web API with standard tokens, you'll need to have the `users:read.email` scope to access that field: <http://api.slack.com/changelog/2017-04-narrowing-email-access|api.slack.com/changelog/2017-04-narrowing-email-access> and <http://api.slack.com/changelog/2016-11-10-addressing-email-addresses|api.slack.com/changelog/2016-11-10-addressing-email-addresses> have more detail.
U3PCMK1AA : Thanks, I thought it would be permission related, but when I saw I could access the phone #, I did not think so anymore :wink:, thanks!
U3PCMK1AA : I already have the scope `users.profile:read`, which, if I'm reading that changelog right should enable me to get the email, right?
U4T0WR6EM : Hi! I have some bot domains available if interested DM me!

U07CW6N3A : I _believe_ that should still grant you access -- at least I wrote that it should back in November! It's possible I mis-spoke and you're the first to notice though :wink:
