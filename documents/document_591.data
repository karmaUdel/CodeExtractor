U3SQ42JJW : Because  List length is undefined the resolving type must be something like … er undefined…
U3SQ42JJW : Ok, I will have to solve this with List.head and if statements…
U48AEBJQ3 : Why do you have a list with a fixed length to begin with?
U3SQ42JJW : It could even be more. But it is the Json that I get from a backend.
U3SQ42JJW : It once was a Tuple, then encoded to a json object… send to a backend… and then received as a json object again and should now turned again into this tuple
U3SQ42JJW : I know… something is completely strange here… :thinking_face:
U48AEBJQ3 : Well, my first reaction would be to try to solve this problem at the JSON decoding step.
U3SQ42JJW : I use this decoder: `JD.maybe (JD.field "range" (JD.keyValuePairs <http://JD.int|JD.int>))`
U48AEBJQ3 : I can try writing something up, you seemed to say that the list could be longer? Do we even care about the field names?
U3SQ42JJW : range is a json-object```
{"start":0, "stop":5}
```

U48AEBJQ3 : ```JD.maybe (JD.field "range" (JD.map2 (,) (JD.field "start" <http://JD.int|JD.int>) (JD.field "stop" <http://JD.int|JD.int>))
```

U3SQ42JJW : daFuCK :flushed:
U3SQ42JJW : sorry… but that's by far better. Perfect !!!
U3SQ42JJW : Thanks :smile:
U48AEBJQ3 : NP. Just always try to make sure that the data that your decoder produces is actual data you want in your app. Cleaning it up later just leads to problems.
U5QE9LDU4 : is JD like an alias for JSON decoder?
U48AEBJQ3 : `import Json.Decode as JD`
U3SQ42JJW : yes
U5QE9LDU4 : is there a way to expand the sidebar for the history explorer?
U5QE9LDU4 : or is hovering over each call the only way to read the full message?
U3SQ42JJW : in Slack?
U5QE9LDU4 : no, the time travel debugger
U5QE9LDU4 : I'm assuming you can't, just wanted to make sure i'm not missing something obvious
U3SQ42JJW : no
U3SQ42JJW : only in the browser inspector
U6EV3H0N7 : <@U5QE9LDU4> I think this was discussed _somewhere_ in this slack yesterday, and the answer was "maybe in 0.19, maybe not" if i remember correctly
U3SQ42JJW : but that's of course not persistent…
U5QE9LDU4 : kk thanks. Ain't no biggy.
U5X2ZRFDF : ```getInts : List (String, Int) -&gt; Maybe (Int, Int)
getInts pairs =
    case pairs of
        [(_, i1), (_, i2)] -&gt; Just (i1, i2)
        _ -&gt; Nothing
```

U23SA861Y : sry what?
U48AEBJQ3 : Leftover from a previous conversation, it appears.
U48AEBJQ3 : And yes, that is how one would implement it if there wasn't a way to fix it before it became a problem.
U3LUC6SNS : I'm looking for more advice on how to deploy an Elm app.  Fire away! :slightly_smiling_face:
U6E5PS83X : Aww, I can't do this:
`import Project.Thing.Request.User as Request.User`

Or can I and I'm missing something?

U6E5PS83X : for example if i have
```
import Project.Thing.Data.User as User
...
import Project.Thing.Request.User as ???
```

U4872964V : No, but you can import it as `RequestUser` for instance
U6E5PS83X : yeah that's probably going to be my workaround. thanks <@U4872964V>!
U3SJEDR96 : You could also make things potentially confusing and improt both `as User` :stuck_out_tongue:
