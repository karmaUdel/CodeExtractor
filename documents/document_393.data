nope
so it has to be explicit
yeah thought so
You can't prove at compile-time that your record will have a field with that name, and that changing the value will result in the correct record shape being returned
yeah makes sense elm-way :smile:
thank you
If you have things like that, maybe a `Dict` is what you are after
If the order of keys in a record doesn't matter, how can `Model` be used as a constructor function [here](<https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/forms.html>)? How would it know which argument goes with which key?
Thanks to you I know have a working version :slightly_smiling_face:
Also it would benefit of some refactoring
At least it works :slightly_smiling_face:
