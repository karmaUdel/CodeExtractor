I just added a new comment in beginner channel that adds more clarity. But you're speaking in haskellian right now, and I haven't done that in _awhile_. It's honestly going to take me a few minutes to parse that statement and then I can tell you.
I think you wnt to move that `)`: `List.map (\x -&gt; List.map (\y -&gt; Domino x y) &lt;| List.range x highest ) &lt;| List.range 0 highest`
<https://ellie-app.com/3KQ5Rq7VdHNa1/0> ?
That... worked? It says I've created a list of a list of dominoes. But If I can just flatten that, I should be fine.
`concatMap` to the rescue
<@U48AEBJQ3> your solution is probably the more clever, FP way to do it, but I'll have to sit and study it.
or what <@U48AEBJQ3> did, which is nice :slightly_smiling_face:
the observation that for every element in the range, you only want to make combinations of the element and everything that follows is clever :slightly_smiling_face:
