I think you need to bounce through a dictionary for this one and then issue the map
mmm.. I was afraid of that. So I'd have to create the nested `Dict` and from that create the `List`.
what does that `attribute` string map to?
presumably the key like `printing`
ah, so there would be multiple options where the `attribute` is `printing`
<@U1EEBCQM6>  ^
If I understand correctly, you want the formatting and printing options together in a flattened list?
Yes.. correct
OK, that should be possible without a `Dict`
let me see if I can write up something
Not that I would have multiple lists. Just one list of all the options. And the `attribute` would allow me to filter based on that.
I thought that might be most efficient

check that out! Let me try to understand it.
