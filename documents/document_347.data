U3KSN5MAL : Hmm, in this case i use this sort of thing to take flags from photoshop to turn on and off things, i have no need for an argument for that
U3KSN5MAL : So i've just been passing in a dummy value and not using it
U3KSN5MAL : seems silly to have to do that
U4872964V : This is because you can't call a function in Elm without a value
U4872964V : However silly it seems, that's the way it works
U5WS7CJLV : I think it was the red carets that threw me off
U3KSN5MAL : i see thanks
U5WS7CJLV : my brain shortcuts to saying "the problem is in the red carets"
U4872964V : yes, sometimes it's hard for the compiler to figure out exactly what you meant
U4872964V : However, Elm beats all other compilers I've used in the error message department
U5FC7BE0G : is there a shortcut/something less verbose for doing this:
```
case model.something of
                Just x -&gt;
                    someCmd

                Nothing -&gt;
                    Cmd.none
```

U48AEBJQ3 : <@U5FC7BE0G> There is `model.something |&gt; Maybe.map (\_ -&gt; someCmd) |&gt; Maybe.withDefault Cmd.none`. If you really want to shrink things down in a particular place, though, make a function.
U5FC7BE0G : thanks <@U48AEBJQ3> ! I thought maybe there's already something built in for this, but i'll create my own shortcut then
U3YDBDP4Z : Wanting to unit test my `update` function, but I don't know where the `ChangeLocation` and `OnLocationChange` messages come from?
U3YDBDP4Z : Need to import them in my tests
U48AEBJQ3 : I'm not familiar with those constructors, are they from a package you are using, or something you defined yourself?
U3YDBDP4Z : I'm not sure where they come from.
U3YDBDP4Z : I would have assumed the Navigation package but it doesn't mention them
U3YDBDP4Z : And the only other package I have is url-parser, which doesn't have them either
U3YDBDP4Z : Which is confusing, since I use them in Update.elm but they are not imported from anything
U48AEBJQ3 : If you are using them somewhere, they are either defined there or they are imported. This is a reason to not import `exposing (..)`, since it makes it more difficult to know where things come from. The navigation package doesn't define any constructors by those names.
U3YDBDP4Z : Haha, you are absolutely correct
U3YDBDP4Z : I was having a brain fart
U4872964V : <@U5FC7BE0G> `if model.something == Nothing then Cmd.none else someCmd` perhaps. If you're not interested in the actual contents of the `Just`
U5FC7BE0G : <@U4872964V> my example was actually a bit wrong. What I actually needed was this:
```
case model.something of
                Just x -&gt;
                    doSomething model.something

                Nothing -&gt;
                    Cmd.none
```

I ended up creating this helper:

```
maybeRunCmd : (a -&gt; Cmd msg) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Cmd msg
maybeRunCmd f maybe =
    maybe
        |&gt; Maybe.map f
        |&gt; Maybe.withDefault Cmd.none
```
... which works like a charm :slightly_smiling_face:

U4872964V : great
U0J8D9M2P : ```But the returned value (shown above) is a:

    { altitude : number, azimuth : number1 }
```

Why does it says `number1`?

U41NK9BM4 : IIRC it is a way to say: could be a different type than the other `number`
U41NK9BM4 : (Int vs. float  - for example)
U635238TG : i'm doing the intro guide and it had me clone over the code examples. however, i want to write these programs myself while I go along. Can I just open up an example.elm file in my text editor, write the code with the tutorial and then...what. Run elm-make to make an html file? and then I can just throw that in the browser to see if it worked?
U0J8D9M2P : you can do it with elm-reactor as well
U0J8D9M2P : which will compile elm files and serve them for you
U635238TG : i see. i guess the examples in the tutorial also happen to be in the directory i installed so I can just open up those exact files with my text editor
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U635238TG> i typically use elm reactor for every meaningful change to quickly test functionality in localhost. elm-make I save for when I'm pushing to remote repo. But I know a lot of folks use automated build tools that run elm-make on every save sometimes.
