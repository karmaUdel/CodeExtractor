<@U300LJUAK> Lol I've struggled a lot with this one. Was actually just coming to that conclusion myself (albeit 100x slower than you )
I was trying to figure out how they used Mdl as a seeming constructor in the `Layout.render` function
actually does let us use the `Mdl` name as a constructor
as its then defined as a component of a union type?
and thus fits neatly into the layout.render fn
It creates a `Mdl` constructor that takes a string and returns a value (of type `Msg` in the first case, and of type `Mdl` in the second). These are the only two cases where you will have constructors automatically created for you.
Thanks a ton :slightly_smiling_face:
No problem :thumbsup:
Is there some sugar in Elm to switch a Boolean?
<@U663M2MB7> do you mean `if True then "blah" else "beep` ?
`not &lt;| lastValue`
<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Basics#not> it's just a regular function
It was a pretty bad idea to begin with
I'm trying to build a progress bar thing, how would I get the width of the element?
<@U26LR8F4H> the best way is to set that width
the other good way is use CSS percentage units so you don't need to know the width
Thanks for the suggestion, that may just work
<@U26LR8F4H> here's some junk you could consider: <https://ellie-app.com/3JgJBMXNxp4a1/2> but i would lean heavily toward jessta's answers
oh thanks, that looks pretty useful as well.
You can also use a port to get JS to query the DOM and pass it back to Elm, but that's quite a lot of effort
how do i use a for loop in elm?
there is no for loop, you'll need to check out `List.map`
there are other functions too, but it depends what you want to do :slightly_smiling_face:
i am trying to build a caesar cipher, for that i need to iterate through the strings
<@U64MK7215> sounds like a perfect use of `List.map`
a caesar cipher is mapping one character to a different character
<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/String#map>
how to a define a  custom function in elm and call it inside update?
