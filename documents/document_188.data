U0LLUCLP3 : Of course good Sir.. I am just trying to find opportunity for Slack.. 
Out of tremendous appreciation for Slack..
I have used Slack (&amp; Twitter) *everyday* since I found them..
I notice a lot of back and forth between tabs..
A combination might result in optimal user engagement for both platforms..
However I can see the merit in your argument.. 
No need to change the diet of a winning horse..

U0LLUCLP3 : Tremendous opportunity for development &amp; work imo.. Thanks for everything.. The End. :sweat_smile:
U0THPLS7L : hey , is it possible to add an attachment for styling to convo.ask ?
U0HKDKHD4 : Can a slackbot introduce themselves upon being added to a team? Of does it have to only use “im.list” to find channels he's already allowed to post through?
U0TFEAH34 : <@U0HKDKHD4> check out <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/examples/slackbutton_bot.js> around line 76
U0TFEAH34 : that might help, not sure
U0TFEAH34 : I'm very new to this :simple_smile:
U0HKDKHD4 : I'm not actually using botkit, but I'll reverse eng that concept. Thanks pal
U0TFEAH34 : no problem
U0TFEAH34 : I think the idea is, you know the user ID of the person that added the integration/app, so send them a DM
U0HKDKHD4 : ```Post to an IM channel
    Posting to an IM channel is a little more complex depending on the value of as_user.

If as_user is false:
- Pass a username (<@U0GNZCZ71>) as the value of channel to post to that user's <@USLACKBOT> channel as the bot.
- Pass the IM channel's ID (D023BB3L2) as the value of channel to post to that IM channel as the bot. The IM channel's ID can be retrieved through the im.list API method.

If as_user is true:
- Pass the IM channel's ID (D023BB3L2) as the value of channel to post to that IM channel as the authenticated user. The IM channel's ID can be retrieved through the im.list API method.
```

U0HKDKHD4 : I'm not sure you can DM based on the user id when posting as_user = true
U0TFEAH34 : ah, I'm posting as a bot
U0HKDKHD4 : Ah, I see. I'm looking at wrong method. What I needed was ‘im.open' instead of posting to a channel
U0TBZRNMV : im.open or mpim.open
U0TBZRNMV : you can also have a look at this sample code (written in java using simple-slack-api)  : <https://github.com/Ullink/simple-slack-api/blob/master/samples/actions/src/main/java/actions/SendingMessages.java>
U0HQA1MLJ : Friday Afternoon Question: Would it be a faux pas to create a channel for porting Bots to Alexa, HipChat, and the like?
U0K7Y2SK0 : <@U0HQA1MLJ>: You might be more interested in the <http://botmakers.org|botmakers.org> slack
U0TGHKPEU : hello guys :simple_smile:
U0TGHKPEU : if i have bot_access_token can i use it to send private message to any member of the team using chat.postMessage method?
U0TGHKPEU : i have also include chat:write:bot scope associated with it is it enough?
U0GT29N3A : <@U0TGHKPEU>: Bot access token has its own scope, which can write to any member of the team.
U0GT29N3A : Don't use it to spam though.
U0D7LHNTX : That's right, on both counts :wink:
U0TGHKPEU : <@U0GT29N3A>: oh thank you, i just want it to use for sending notification from time to time :simple_smile:
U0THPLS7L : hey guys, which code editor du you use? and has it a botkit autocompletion ?
U0TTN1XST : hello folks. I have a bunch of questions. There is… so much to do.
U0TTN1XST : my little test bot is still running locally, and I'm using localtunnel to run it on port 8765 (per <@U0D7LHNTX>'s helpful medium post). As I kill the process, go edit my code, and re-run it, though, occasionally I have to go back and re-authorize my bot via the <http://myawesomebot.localtunnel.me/login|myawesomebot.localtunnel.me/login> URL. This seems weird, that I would have to re-authenticate it. I must be doing something wrong… ?
U0TTN1XST : finally - I find it weird that my javascript variables don't seem to work inside `controller.storage.teams.save` calls. Like, I can save something with the `id: message.team`, but if I try to save something beneath that with `message.user` or something, it blows up
U0TTN1XST : anyway… appreciate any thoughts y'all have. Total n00bville over here.
U0L582UKY : <http://Api.ai|Api.ai> for Slack is on <http://ProductHunt.com|ProductHunt.com> today. Would really appreciate your support!
U0PQVS7D3 : <@U0TTN1XST>: if you're having your bot save state you might be overwriting the state it references at start-up which tells it what it needs to connect to teams. Going through the authentication workflow provides the bot with that information.
U0H98UCGY : <@U0L582UKY>: voting you all up now and I am super excited about building on the <http://Api.ai|Api.ai> platform.  Please don't get bought by Facebook and shutdown a few weeks later :grinning: #ParsePain
U0T6UC25P : <@U0D7LHNTX> i have a question regarding an existing b2b business adding slack integration and how that relates to slack TOS, may I DM you?
U0D7LHNTX : Go for it!
U0D7LHNTX : Please never hesitate to DM me, y'all. Might have to wait until Monday ;) but always happy to help out and answer your questions. 
U0JPS3SHX : <@U0D7LHNTX> <@U04SS2NBF> would you guys consider setting up a UserVoice page or something similar to collect all the API ideas and have some sort of discussion around it, specially to check if someone else has already suggested that or not etc.. I have used for my Slack app and has been really helpful.
U0TTN1XST : hey, quick question for anyone who knows… using the Botkit module, I'm building nested conversation threads using separate functions for different convo branches. I've noticed that I can't access the `message` object in sub-functions from `controller.hears` - am I doing something wrong? Is there a better way of calling the team/user ID from other functions during a convo?
U0TTN1XST : okay, or another - anyone know how I can access a user's username, instead of just `id`?
U0SSVS33N : <@U0TTN1XST>: you can get it from the API if necessary, something like:`<http://bot.api.users.info|bot.api.users.info>({ user : [id] }, function (err, response) { ... });`

U0SSVS33N : though there are ways to just include the id in your message text and have the username show up in its place
U0TTN1XST : <@U0SSVS33N>: would that be in the Slack API docs, or in botkit's?
U0SSVS33N : mostly in the Slack API docs
U0SSVS33N : <@U0TTN1XST>: the Botkit docs mention `bot.api`, but beyond that point it's Slack's API
U0TFNC8HE : how can I reduce the debug level of botkit?
U0TFNC8HE : <@U0SSVS33N>: ``bot.api.users.list`` is outputting a lot of json data with `debug: true`. There's a way to select levels?
U0TFNC8HE : it's okay i just commented the line
U0TFNC8HE : what can i do with this event: `debug: No handler for reconnect_url`
U0TFNC8HE : ?
U0HBN0L9M : is it me, or bot ID got changed from #UXXX to #BXXX ?
U0HBN0L9M : no, wait, I'm confused. the bot_message event refers to a bot_id starting in B
U0SDZFGCX : do you guys know what is the average wait to get an app approved?
U0HLC2479 : mine from submitted to approved in 3-4 days
U0SDZFGCX : thanks! did you get any confirmation email?
U0SDZFGCX : when you submitted it?
U0SDZFGCX : I didn't get any
U0SDZFGCX : I just got the ‘thank you' page from airtable
U0HLC2479 : I didn't get any confirmation either
U0HLC2479 : just be patient :wink:
U0SDZFGCX : :simple_smile:
U0SDZFGCX : you're right, I'm just excited
U0SDZFGCX : thanks <@U0HLC2479>
U0U3C1DUK : Hi All, I want my bot should give me names of people in my applications,  if asked "@bot, who knows html5 and Javascript in Pune?"
U0U3C1DUK : i suppose slash commands cant be used here, as nothing starts with "/"
U0U3C1DUK : can anybody please help me in deciding right approach to implement this
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0U3C1DUK>, what you want is a bot rather than a slash command, check out botkit if you are going to do it with nodejs
U0U3C1DUK : Thanks for the reply, i will go through botkit.. but i need to do it in ruby, any idea if it is possible?
U0KECURAT : <@U0U3C1DUK>: sure it's possible, you'll have to tell your bot who knows what first though
U0U3C1DUK : Thanks a bunch, let me understand in detail bot kit first
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0U3C1DUK>: yes, it's possible check the projects mentioned in <#C0HUW58BC>
U0U3C1DUK : Great, Thanks :+1:
U0HKDKHD4 : Hey slackers, we've created a personal finance slack bot which we are looking for alpha testers. If you'd be interested in helping us test it would be much appreciated. (UI/UX is Alpha, the security around your data is not)
sign up here if you're interest <http://meetabe.co|meetabe.co>

U0GPSB7V1 : interesting <@U0HKDKHD4> !
U0GPSB7V1 : is it using the usual scrapers to access your finances?
U0HKDKHD4 : thanks pal, we've been working hard on it. fyi it will be available for sms as well
U0HKDKHD4 : we access via Yodlee a very common scraper
U0GPSB7V1 : yeah i've used them
U0GPSB7V1 : just confirmed my Meet Abe subscription
U0GPSB7V1 : have you automated the MailChimp -&gt; slack channel invite process?
U055FHACC : <@U0HKDKHD4> I'm guessing you need a US bank account for this?
U0HKDKHD4 : for the alpha yes. Outside of alpha I'm going to first support GB + Canada and expand from there.
U0HKDKHD4 : <@U0GPSB7V1>: I have alerts posting from mailchimp but I am going to onboard everyone at one time so I can communicate leading up to it.
U0HKDKHD4 : thanks for signing up guys!
U0H98UCGY : looks good <@U0HKDKHD4> will try it out .. any plans for small business operations financial advice?
U0H98UCGY : I also like the website presentation for <http://meetabe.co|meetabe.co>
U0CSJUB1D : Very nice so far 
U0HKDKHD4 : We are still working out the details on where we can go. My main mission right now is to give people real world  info on their money and get people out of the <http://mint.com|mint.com> mindset of reading graphs
U0HKDKHD4 : thanks <@U0CSJUB1D>
U0T6UC25P : hey <@U0GPSB7V1> i forked your goslackbot to play with it and use it for a bot i am building. I am thinking of implementing some of the botkit features in there, such as the storage and the oauth endpoints. Would it be ok for me to work on toying with those changes in my fork and/or to submit PR to you if they come to fruition? I am a .net dude, but moving to go for the new project.
U0GPSB7V1 : surely!
U0GPSB7V1 : one thing i am working on is making it reconnect if its websocket gets closed
U0GPSB7V1 : because right now i just goes deaf :smile:
U0T6UC25P : right, i was going to look into that today, because every morning i wake up and the connection is gone :simple_smile:
U0T6UC25P : i am also getting dupe messages if i reconnect/connect quickly in testing, and some of the messages come from the bot itself (the prior bot reply comes back as incoming message), so i was going to try to streamline some of that.
U0H98UCGY : <@U0GPSB7V1>: where are you hosting the goslackbot? Google cloud?
U0GPSB7V1 : yeah the main app I've embedded a bot in right now runs in App Engine
U0H98UCGY : <@U0HKDKHD4>: which provider are you using to manage your SMS?  Twilio? Asking because we are trying to find a good option for our bot/app.   Anyone else have any suggestions?
U0HKDKHD4 : twilio
U0HKDKHD4 : they have a lot of great features
U0G6ZCWES : fun article about integrating Slack and IOT using Particle: <https://community.particle.io/t/interacting-with-particle-device-using-slack-and-natural-language-processing/21268>
U0U9DQ4TH : Hey, is there any kind of dead connection detection/handling for <http://Howdy.ai|Howdy.ai>'s Botkit code?
U0U9DQ4TH : In the RTM API docs, it mentions a ping/pong, but I don't see how to send the ping in Botkit?  <https://api.slack.com/rtm>
U0TFEAH34 : When I turn on my bot in debug mode, I see pings arriving every second
U0TFEAH34 : i.e. `var controller = Botkit.slackbot({ 'debug': true })`
U0TFEAH34 : you can also add a handler for rtm_stop
U0TFEAH34 : iirc
U0TFEAH34 : &lt;== _not_ an expert
U0HKDKHD4 : <@U0G6ZCWES>: At the Orlando Slack Dev meetup there was a guy who hooked up his garden's watering system to a slash command via ardiuno. Its sounded rad
U0U9DQ4TH : Hm, it looks like the Botkit code should be issuing a ping every 5,000ms, but I still find my bot getting disconnecting after long periods of inactivity.  :disappointed:
U0U9DQ4TH : ```                pingIntervalId = setInterval(function() {
                    bot.rtm.ping(null, null, true);
                }, 5000);
```

U0TFEAH34 : oh, that's interesting
U0TFEAH34 : I've noticed my bots not responding after I leave them overnight
U0TFEAH34 : but I hadn't tried to debug it yet
U0U9DQ4TH : Hm, that is actually using the ws module's `ping()` which sends a WebSocket-level ping, and doesn't actually seem to expect/fail if it doesn't get a proper socket-level pong response.
U0U9DQ4TH : I'm going to work on adding application-level ping/pong response to Botkit, see if I can get this working.
U0T6UC25P : <@U0HKDKHD4> Orlando, as in Orlando, FL?? is there is a Slack Dev Meet up here? I am out of Orlando, my office is at the UCF's research park, been looking for a meetup here.
