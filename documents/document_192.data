U11AWUFHV : when I run "node facebook_bot.js" I just get "debug: No handler for tick"
U11AWUFHV : over and over again
U0HBN0L9M : that's not an issue
U0HBN0L9M : it's because you've left the verbose mode
U0HBN0L9M : you might want to check <#C0AV5N8NA> or <#C11Q41CR3> for more advices though
U11AWUFHV : wow <@U0HBN0L9M> thanks for the heads up
U0K6HTZK4 : <@U0GQ2JCCA>: Thanks for the followup.  I think I will try kick before archive.
U0GQ2JCCA : sounds good :simple_smile:
U11AWUFHV : has anyone got botkit facebook messenger set up on azure
U11AWUFHV : i'm a newbie but am trying to configure the example from github
U0M0UPJ3W : <@U0YQS1FAR> <@U0GT29N3A> :  thanks for suggestions!  i ended up replacing with look alike unicode chars:```
function escapeMessageFormattingChars(text){
    // slack doesn't let us escape message formatting characters.
    // messages are either formatted or not! this is problematic, when
    // a bot wants to create a formatted message that includes user generated
    // text, such as document titles. So since we can't escape, we replace
    // the relevant formatting chars (`, *, _, ~, &lt;, &gt; ) with unicode 'twins',
    // i.e. unicode chars that look similar but wont cause slack to interpret
    // them as formatting characters.

    var escapedText = text;

    // replace 'grave accent' (U+0060) with 'reversed prime' (U+2035)
    escapedText = escapedText.replace(/`/g, "?");

    // replace 'asterisk' (U+002A) with 'heavy asterisk' (U+2731)
    escapedText = escapedText.replace(/\*/g, "?");

    // replace 'low line' (U+005F) with 'fullwidth low line' (U+FF3F)'
    escapedText = escapedText.replace(/_/g, "?");

    // replace 'tilde' (U+005F) with 'fullwidth tilde' (U+FF5E)'
    escapedText = escapedText.replace(/~/g, "?");

    // replace 'greater-than sign' (U+003E) with 'single right-pointing angle quotation mark' (U+203A)
    escapedText = escapedText.replace(/&gt;/g, "›");

    // replace 'less-than sign' (U+003C) with 'single left-pointing angle quotation mark' (U+2039)
    escapedText = escapedText.replace(/&lt;/g, "‹");

    return escapedText;
}
```

U0HBN0L9M : <@U0M0UPJ3W>: bookmarked
U0HBN0L9M : Hello all, here I share some thoughts about conversational interfaces (hint: the trend is real and attractive, but the NLP/AI thing is only an add-on for now). Please disagree !
<http://fr.slideshare.net/MatthieuVaragnat/conversational-interfaces>

U04SM6T2H : I would love to hear what the pizza ordering fallacy is  <@U0HH00DS7>
U04SM6T2H : but I think you are right on
U04SM6T2H : i spend a lot of time every day now
U04SM6T2H : saying
U04SM6T2H : look, messaging apps are great because its like a crappy web browser inside SMS
U04SM6T2H : NOT because its an AI that solves all your problems without having to code it
U0GT29N3A : <@U04SM6T2H>: I can tell about the pizza fallacy. Here's a example pizza bot interaction. :man: Hi pizza bot, I'd like to order
:robot_face: Ok what size for the pizza?
:man: Big!
:robot_face: What topping do you want?
:man: Pepperoni please 
:robot_face: Ok, what else?
:man: Cheese too!
:robot_face: Ok, when do you need it?
[...]

It's a ping-pong conversation, which is a terrible user interaction. You'd better get the phone and ask directly, it would be quicker!

U0GPSB7V1 : yeah, it would be better if you just said “i want a large with pepperoni and sausage delivered ASAP” but getting the robots to grok that… oy.
U04SM6T2H : right
U04SM6T2H : CONCUR
U04SM6T2H : I also think it is hilarious to see demos where like
U04SM6T2H : people say
U04SM6T2H : Pepperoni pizza
U04SM6T2H : wait no, onions
U04SM6T2H : like, how many millions of dollars of R&amp;D are needed to deal with that in a generic way
U04SM6T2H : something that could otherwise be ahndled by like
U04SM6T2H : TOPPINGS: pepperoni [remove]
U04SM6T2H : guys bots are magic and will not only replace all other software, but all other people including software developers
U0GPSB7V1 : that would be so nice
U0GPSB7V1 : then i could just go raise goats
U0CRS2WV9 : no doubt!
U0GPSB7V1 : :robot_face: :chicken:
U0CRS2WV9 : def think syntax idioms need better discussion / there is a fallacy that the command line was abandoned in the 80s therefore we are supposedly ready to transcend the GUI with super machines when most programmers still spend their day in a shell
U0CRS2WV9 : if WE haven't walked from syntax …then nope!
U0GPSB7V1 : yeah, i'm tempted sometimes to implement bot commands with flags like -i &lt;name&gt; -x &lt;object&gt;
U0GPSB7V1 : make slack into a shell of sorts
U0GPSB7V1 : i dunno if people could handle it
U0CRS2WV9 : there's def a balance
U0CRS2WV9 : nobody is saying Bash is good or ‘the right way' but there's good lessons (like don't do what git did!)
U0GPSB7V1 : the bot i'm working on now is an administrative interface for creating/enabling/disabling developer accounts
U0GPSB7V1 : and it has commands like “please grant access to &lt;email&gt; with code &lt;code&gt;"
U0GPSB7V1 : and even i forget the syntax
U0GPSB7V1 : also, the please is not optional :smile:
U0CRS2WV9 : `/grant @uname `
U0CRS2WV9 : etc
U0GPSB7V1 : yeah, i didn't get into slash commands yet.  it's just a simple RTM bot
U0CRS2WV9 : fwiw, think slash commands might be a red herring / bots are more likely to get interaction
also oddly I think REST might have some nice clues for creating syntaxes (verb noun params)

U0CRS2WV9 : somethin like `@foobot grant @uname magic-code`
U0HBN0L9M : <@U04SM6T2H>: people keep pinging the poor mathieu with 1 `t` and I don't get the notifs :simple_smile:
U0HBN0L9M : the order a pizza fallacy is that all bot ai engine offer this as an example
U0HBN0L9M : while it's an extremely lousy example in my opinion, much more taps that clicking on the pizza you like in a browser/mobile app
U0HBN0L9M : like <@U0GT29N3A> described
U0HBN0L9M : one solution is webviews, images and so on, like wechat
U0CS6NSF5 : that's basically due to very basic NLP interactions
U0HBN0L9M : but in general I say to people - don't confuse NLP/AI/bots with messaging apps
U0CS6NSF5 : you can do:&gt; deliver 3 pepperoni pizzas with onion ASAP

U0CS6NSF5 : and answer many questions at once
U0CS6NSF5 : NLP != turning a form with multiple fields into multiple bot questions
U0HBN0L9M : start either with command line rigid syntax - add NLP later to fluidify stuff - like <@U055FHACC> or <@U0GRN5Q3G> did beautifully
U0CS6NSF5 : but turning a phrase into multiple form fields and ask for any extra information
U0HBN0L9M : or start with human interaction, add NLP later to automatize
U0HBN0L9M : <@U0CS6NSF5> true but A) it's really hard to get right B) it fails in the most frustrating manner
U0HBN0L9M : difficulty is not commensurate to rewards
U0HBN0L9M : I'm not saying it's not useful - I'm saying most of the usefulness doesn't come from there
U0CS6NSF5 : well, that's what it should be about, but it's going to be crazy expensive to develop
U0CS6NSF5 : and only for narrow use cases
U0HBN0L9M : the real excitation, in my mind, is new messaging platforms
U0CS6NSF5 : some friends did it in the past for hotel bookings
U04SM6T2H : <http://bot.watch/post/143537849782/your-friendly-slack-bot-might-be-exposing-your>
U0HBN0L9M : allowing for asynchronous, convenient interaction, cross platform apps, long tails effects
U04SM6T2H : A good reminder - don't be a token leaker!!
U04SM6T2H : &gt;&gt;&gt; Detectify claims it has found over 1,500 tokens that appear to be related to Slack. Although none of the companies or organisations are named, Detectify says some of the leaks are coming from universities, health care providers, newspapers, and advertising agencies too.
U0GPSB7V1 : this happens on every. platform. ever.
U04SM6T2H : yeh
U0GPSB7V1 : remember when people's twitter tokens spewed out on the net? good times.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U04SM6T2H>: when was that posted?
U04SM6T2H : today
U04SM6T2H : <http://motherboard.vice.com/read/your-fun-slack-bot-could-be-a-security-vulnerability>
U0HBN0L9M : yes <@U0CS6NSF5> but what % of the value of the end service came from NLP, and what % from booking an hotel from chat ?
U04SM6T2H : that's the source piece
U0HBN0L9M : if it was manned by humans
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0HBN0L9M>: it wasn't a chat service
U0CS6NSF5 : they used NLP for initial search and other areas
U0CS6NSF5 : this is pre-bots
U0HBN0L9M : ok
U0GPSB7V1 : i built an IVR for a phone company once that used speech recognition and nlp to route people to the right agents
U0HBN0L9M : in any case, I'm not arguing it's useless - it real does fluidify interactions if done right - there's just too much hype for something that should be the :cherries: on the :cake:
U04SM6T2H : concur :simple_smile:
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0HUTFBHS>: you haven't searched properly :simple_smile:
U0GPSB7V1 : oh :shit: <https://github.com/search?q=xoxb&amp;type=Code&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93>
U0GQ2JCCA : <https://github.com/andrewjkerr/slackbot-ruby-starter/blob/ba3be3a883c1f8454ed5380887094b7b311dcecf/config/application.sample.yml#L1>
U0GQ2JCCA : woah, that leak
U0HUTFBHS : oh how fascinating
U0HUTFBHS : xoxb- doesn't find them.  xoxb, does.  :simple_smile:
U0HUTFBHS : Some search box magic, that.
U0GPSB7V1 : oy. there are… a bunch.
U0GPSB7V1 : but none in Go so i'm safe :stuck_out_tongue:
U0HUTFBHS : People just can't keep a secret.
U0KECURAT : <@U0HUTFBHS>: not really, if you know that github's search is backed by elasticsearch it's pretty easy to figure out. ES by default tokenises strings and `-` is one of the characters it splits on. E.g. using `-` in your search won't do you much good :simple_smile:
U0HUTFBHS : Well, in that case I'd expect the two searches to be equivalent, though they are not.  I haven't done a lot of mucking about with ES's query language, though.
U14SCJSMV : hey, guys, came here because I'm confused about how botkit "automatically" uses the built-in storage. It seems to me that you always have to save data in it yourself and retrieve it manually later. Why are people wrapping up their databases to work with the built-in storage module instead of working with their databases natively?
U0KECURAT : <@U14SCJSMV>: it's nice to have *one* way of doing things across the board I guess
U0HBN0L9M : and it's a really well designed wrapper
U0HBN0L9M : if you don't have much other stuff to do, it's very useful
U0HBN0L9M : I've copied the wrapper to use in other mongo project, not bot related
U0HBN0L9M : very clean
U14SCJSMV : <@U0HBN0L9M>:  okay, that makes sense. But the documentation mentions that botkit uses the storage module "automatically" when dealing with slack button apps. Can you explain what that means?
U0YQS1FAR : Another reason is that on some systems (like Heroku) you can't write persistently to the file system
U0YQS1FAR : and botkit writes to .json files to persist the data. So in our case we needed to use a database
U0YQS1FAR : Ah, I misread the question
U04SM6T2H : the automatic part is
U04SM6T2H : that when using the slack button oauth
U04SM6T2H : it stores information using the built in storage system
U0HDXGVDF : friendly reminder! <http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/04/hacking-slack-accounts-as-easy-as-searching-github/>
U0K4TM8N8 : And a follow up from Slack <https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/slack-tokens-what-they-are-how-theyre-used-and-how-to-keep-your-data-safe-ed1b00d2715a#.dpkk0b886>
U0HBN0L9M : ping <@U07HXFWUD> or <@U0LKH699P> for the top result
U0HUZ214H : Tonight's reading in here has been great. I started all Gung Ho 3-4 months ago, developing 2 bots with <#C0AV5N8NA>. I made them both work great, even reprogrammed both several times to add validation but mostly a better UI and experience. That was the easy part, despite being new to Node.js among other things. Mostly thanks to many of you writing this evening. But where it all came to a crashing halt (several trips and funerals notwithstanding) is when I was ready to launch. 
At that time, the same players were discussing encryption and scaling. Since that time I have tried  several different data storage approaches, hosting approaches (AWS, DigitalOcean, and $$Google$Cloud$Platform$$). Information, or better yet, code examples of both 'great' encryption and scaling have been very hard to come by. So I have been learning, trying, but mostly seeing hundreds of other bots launching.

It's been frustrating, but after seeing the articles of the token/data leakage (ew), I can say in hindsight, that my fear of launching may have been grounded in reality, and I'm happy I didn't do it half-assed. 

Now I'm finally starting to see some of this hard to come by info/code examples starting to make their way out there, thankfully. Perhaps there is still hope these bots see the light of day before the critics and poorly designed ones do more damage to the new newness. I plan to document my experience for other n00bs soon here and that other medium everyone posts everything on now.

U0HBN0L9M : that'd be awesome
U0HBN0L9M : <@U0HUZ214H>: not only you'd be sharing important lessons (&amp; code samples?) but also you'd be reminding people that security is important
U0HBN0L9M : I think you took the right path
U0HBN0L9M : we discussed with <@U0D7LHNTX> that they might be going to share some security related best practices
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0HUZ214H>: bear in mind these news are equivalent to people tweeting their gmail username and password, it's about pure negligence rather than poor engineering
U0CS6NSF5 : the worst part about this whole situation is the message “Slack bots are a big security threat and are going to leave you exposed”, which will make more teams restrict installing bots to only admins, which will in turn limit the growth of bots
U0CS6NSF5 : on the other hand, bots really are a security threat, and you have to take security seriously and be ready to have detailed conversations about privacy and security with big companies who will want to use your bot, these kind of news will scare smaller companies into not installing bots too
U0HUZ214H : Very true <@U0CS6NSF5>. Got to get ahead of this.
U0HUZ214H : Thanks <@U0HBN0L9M> for the encouragement.
U157DF4PN : hi, i develop a bot with Botkit and my question is, how can i send e message to an channel that can only see the sender ?
U157DF4PN : e = a
U0XJZ7WMR : would it work if you direct messaged the sender
U0XJZ7WMR : that's what I do
U0563E81H : Looks like some of our bot's users can change his profile picture (or he doesn't appear with the marketplace's image) - anyone experienced it?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0563E81H>: Slack has been having some trouble with profile pictures over the past day or so
U0CS6NSF5 : were you getting broken images?
U0563E81H : <@U055FHACC> told me that the ernesto-bot will have the answers...
U0CS6NSF5 : :blush:
U0563E81H : They're seeing the generic plaid
U0563E81H : <https://scontent.fhfa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/13130953_10154240408917074_2671676178071427323_o.jpg> - like this
U0CS6NSF5 : it may have to do with the issues they were having
U15AQ2T6X : question regarding the unfurling parameters when posting messages:```
{
	"unfurl_links": false,
	"unfurl_media": false,
        "text": "&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E14CpfUJXvU|should not disable preview&gt;"
}
```
 when both of those are false my assumption is that the preview would never show up. but it seems to anyways. is this the intended behaviour?

U15AQ2T6X : using the <https://api.slack.com/docs/formatting/builder> to test the behaviour.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0563E81H>: last info I got a couple of hours ago was that they were rolling out a fix to the issue with profile pictures, but the issue could take 24 hours to be completely fixed, so that might be the reason
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0563E81H>: I would suggest reporting the issue in case it's some other problem related to profile pics, or just wait 24 hours and see if the problem persists
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U15AQ2T6X>: setting `unfurl_media` to false should prevent the links from unfurling
U15AQ2T6X : that was my understanding. but I'm not seeing any behaviour changes for either true or false.
U07VCKRUK : Looks like the message builder isn't working properly for that case.
U15AQ2T6X : I'm also not seeing any behaviour changes in slack
U07VCKRUK : I just tried out your payload and the youtube video didn't unfurl for me.
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U15AQ2T6X>: I just tried it and it worked as expected
