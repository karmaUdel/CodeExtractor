Looks like bots cannot join channels, so what do folks normally do.. create a new channel?  DMs?
oh.. right.. slack is invite based ... okay.. I'll stop babbling now... have a good night all
I have a bot user approved and would like to get the messages posted to a channel. how do i do it through a RTM ?  or should i go for events api ? i have a bot token approved.  but do i need to have a specific oauth token generated ?

Hi All!,  does slack allow to user to give review  slack app?
<@U3236DR4Z> It's on their long-term roadmap: <https://trello.com/c/Xwdpj2fX/4-app-ratings-and-reviews>
<@U0GT29N3A> you don't like Juno's Bot? :smile:
<@U3VCCQLM9> This is a public channel with 4000+ humans, bots are now welcome here.
but i like bots :disappointed:
although i'm partial since i have my own :smile:
bots shouldn't be in the general channel, pretty sure it's in the guidelines for this team as well :slightly_smiling_face:
Just imagine the chaos that would ensure if every 4000+ people added their own bot here. :boom:
point taken
haha
is any user allowed to add their own bot? i thought creating tokens is restricted to the admins/owner
Okay,  Thx <@U0GT29N3A>

Hey All - I'm putting together a blog post about lessons learned getting to 100 paid customers for our Slack App - <http://Tettra.co|Tettra.co>. Have a few so far and thought it'd be good to ask the community here if you have any specific questions about the journey.
Turning this proactivity into a thread
Im just commenting so I can keep an eye here :smile:
Would love to read about identifying leads, converting teams and retaining them.
<@U0V93GE5R> Good questions. Specifically are you talking about the tools we use for our sales funnel or how we get the leads in the first place?
And, well done :slightly_smiling_face:
Will read this post for sure!
If you could speak to some of the economics of determining your pricing model, that would be interesting to me :thumbsup:
both really!
<@U1DDKQPGB> Can answer all those. <@U04S3JCH2> Will cover those too.
I think this might end up being more than one post :slightly_smiling_face:
interested as well
thanks Andy
I think it's going to be a great post. This is uncharted territory you're talking! Would love to read your story about the lead up to launching paid accounts and some reflection on what worked/what didn't would be awesome. :slightly_smiling_face: Can't wait.
3. Challenges with onboarding that you are tackling to educate users
peterswimm: already did… Sorry for the inconvenience..
My specific question about your journey would be about your pricing: Is $5/u/m version 1 of your pricing? Have you considered charging per team, or per page? $5/u/m is pretty close to Slack's $6.67/u/m, am I the first one to make this comment :wink: ?
If you have any bot idea do not hesitate to ping me :slightly_smiling_face:

For security and user monitoring and analytics <http://MetaCert.com|MetaCert.com> charges $1.5 per user per month. We haven't tested other pricing yet so don't know if it's the best option for our particular use case.
We're happy to add to our existing SDKs to bring developers the tools they need to get productive on the Slack Platform faster and easier. Check out this tutorial on our blog: <https://medium.com/@SlackAPI/enhancing-slacks-events-api-7535827829ab>
