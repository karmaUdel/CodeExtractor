U41NK9BM4 : It's all there, really
U41NK9BM4 : Even we you do an HTTP request inside a function you are writing a pure function. Go figure! :slightly_smiling_face:
U285A8S8H : are you sure?
U41NK9BM4 : Of course. Because you return a *description* of what to do and pass that the Elm runtime.
U41NK9BM4 : A description cannot fail or return something different each time.
U41NK9BM4 : A decription is "Hey Elm runtime, grab that URL and return to me the payload". Elm does the job and call your `update` function.
U285A8S8H : sure, that makes sense
U285A8S8H : I thought you meant that literally making http requests still gives you a pure function
U41NK9BM4 : Ah sorry. Indeed "you do an HTTP request" is not precise :slightly_smiling_face:
U3SJEDR96 : (hence why you can only trigger side-effects by returning them from `init` or `update`; both which "happen" to be called by the runtime)
U62KVQVD1 : How should I implement ```init : Session -&gt; Task PageLoadError Model``` to return empty Model?
U62KVQVD1 : <https://gist.github.com/korczis/9b3c8449c1f8cc5d008f6bec560df67d#file-home-elm-L19>
U62KVQVD1 : I am trying to rip off parts of the spa-example and integrate it with my phoenix/elm SPA.
U0J8D9M2P : I'm making public package. I have a function from a module which returns an extensible record and the type alias for that record is defined in the same module. Do I need to expose that type record in order to use it outside of the module?
U3584SW4R : This is not be related to elm directly, but can someone help me in deciding between webpack and brunch? Which one would you prefer for a new project today?
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U62KVQVD1> That seems like a not very good idea at first glance, but you can do it by going `Task.map (always {})`. However, the standard thing to use in this sort of case is `()` a.k.a. unit.
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U0J8D9M2P> It's a good idea to expose at least the top level of all types that your exposed types use in their type signatures. You can expose type aliases too.
U62KVQVD1 : <@U48AEBJQ3> What is not good idea? To rip off the parts of spa-example?
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U3584SW4R> Brunch is a more accessible design, but webpack has a lot more mind-share behind it. Depends on one's experience, tolerance for learning a system, and need for more interesting things.
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U62KVQVD1> No, making a special type for unit and throwing away any data the `Task` is producing on success seems a bit strange.
U62KVQVD1 : I just want to make it working and later add more fields and connect it with REST API
U2D7NUGS1 : I'm about to push my first package to the registry :scream: :scream_cat: and want to preview docs with <http://package.elm-lang.org/help/docs-preview>. But executing `elm-make --docs=documentation.json` produces `[]` in the file and a message: `Success! Compiled 0 modules.`. Here is the code: <https://github.com/lzrski/elm-polymer/tree/pre-publish>
U2D7NUGS1 : What am I doing wrong?
U48AEBJQ3 : Right, but `Request.Article.tags` returns a specific type. It's generally preferable to dump that back into an `update` function and work with the result there.
U0J8D9M2P : <@U2D7NUGS1> you need to add exposed modules to list of exposed modules in elm-package.json
U2D7NUGS1 : Aha! Makes sense. Thanks <@U0J8D9M2P> !
U2D7NUGS1 : Haha! I love you people. You just helped me before I've asked question. I wanted to paste a big chunk of code to ask why it's not working, and as I was selecting it, I've spotted the bug :slightly_smiling_face:
U2D7NUGS1 : It's only possible because of your super friendly attitude.
U62UFEG4D : Hello Elm people !
U2D7NUGS1 : But I've also learned something interesting. If one just define a value, like that: ```fetchData =
    let
        url =
            Debug.log "Getting analysis" "<https://www.example.com/some-data.json>"
    in
        Http.get url Decode.value
            |&gt; Http.send DataFetched
``` then the `let` clause will be eagerly executed, even if I don't reference it anywhere. In this case the `Debug.log` did it's effect despite the fact that `fetchData` was not called. I was expecting it to be lazy.

U2D7NUGS1 : Hello, <@U62UFEG4D> !
U62UFEG4D : hey <@U2D7NUGS1>
U2D7NUGS1 : To finish my though: That got me confused.
U62UFEG4D : I am doing the elm tutorial, I am struggling at the section Random : <https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/effects/random.html> . I am trying to to have 2 die rolling at the same time. My  first idea was to have to have message with 2 payloads e.g.```type Msg
    = Roll
     | NewFace Int Int ```
but then I could not figure out how to have my random generator returns 2 value.

My second attempt was to change the view to have the button click generates 2 events like this :        `     , button [ (onClick Roll1), (onClick Roll2)] [ text "Roll" ]` , but this update only one die.

Can you provide hint on how to solve this using my knowledge of the previous part of the tutorial.
Thanks in advance

U62UFEG4D : I have shared in this snippet my second attempt...
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U62UFEG4D> `Random.map2`
U48AEBJQ3 : `Random.map2 (,) (<http://Random.int|Random.int> 1 6) (<http://Random.int|Random.int> 1 6) |&gt; Random.generate (uncurry NewFace)`
U62UFEG4D : <@U48AEBJQ3> it works now, thanks a lot!
U604S603Y : is there a way with elm-package to "restore" packages that are already mentioned as dependencies in my elm-package.json?
