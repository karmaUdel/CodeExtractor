U36797FQ9 : <@U272P5K71> not sure what you mean by "send code"
U36797FQ9 : but I appreciate the help
U36797FQ9 : <@U272P5K71> here's what I'm writing so far. It's ... early :slightly_smiling_face: <https://gist.github.com/mjbrender/46a2fbd86e5d9257d76d3fe81ab2fb8a>
U272P5K71 : what method was that cleanupbot message sent via?
U36797FQ9 : I haven't sent any messages with cleanupbot to this channel
U36797FQ9 : It's marking a message `@mb` sent as from `@cleanupbot`
U36797FQ9 : and by it, I mean the results of `channel.history` as seen by this client.. which I should test via curl real quick to verify it's not a strange bug in the client.
U272P5K71 : are you sending via the bearer token?
U272P5K71 : or the bot token?
U36797FQ9 : bot token
U36797FQ9 : Interesting, when I use the tester url I don't get this odd behavior: 
```
{
    "ok": true,
    "messages": [
        {
            "type": "message",
            "user": "U3X7G03BR",
            "text": "asdf",
            "ts": "1486160034.000005"
        },
        {
            "type": "message",
            "user": "U3X7G03BR",
            "text": "why",
            "ts": "1486160033.000004"
        },
        {
            "type": "message",
            "user": "U3X7G03BR",
            "text": "whahashfhadshfadf",
            "ts": "1486160032.000003"
        },
        {
            "user": "U3X7G03BR",
            "text": "&lt;@U3X7G03BR|mb&gt; has joined the channel",
            "type": "message",
            "subtype": "channel_join",
            "ts": "1486157512.000002"
        }
    ],
    "has_more": false
}
```

U36797FQ9 : everything is showing from the same user, which is correct.
U36797FQ9 : <@U272P5K71> are you seeing what I'm seeing here or am I jumping the wrong direction? It looks like the most recent message user is being overwritten somewhere in the client call.
U0YB2C09Y : I think you might be looking for something similar to what <@U3C6UAKDY> doesThey allow you to test your chatbot against a huge amount of potential inputs

U419E6R60 : Has anyone here had any success getting a user's location data, outside of timezone?
U419E6R60 : For instance, data with regards to the user's team's office address?
U1DDKQPGB : <@U419E6R60> why would you want their precise location? that might freak them out a little
U0HUZ214H : <@U419E6R60> I am looking for this currently myself and asked in here how people were getting it, but did not hear a response. If you find anything, pass it along.
U0HUZ214H : <@U1DDKQPGB> I'm building a bot for my company event at a city where people who work together are meeting over a few days. Some of the requirements out of brainstorming were location and direction info as well as nearby searches. Whether I hit mapping APIs or just pre-populate some basic results, it will be very helpful info for users to have access to. Knowing their exact location lets you tie into the API and mapping stuff fairly easily, at least in theory.
Depends on platform, device, and UX for getting lat/long to the bot, but if everyone's building app killers, should we focus on the most important apps people have used to kill? :slightly_smiling_face:

U055FHACC : On turning your bot into a habit:<https://medium.com/@mmatty/retention-hero-bb236f055462>

U21U8SZ2P : Not sure where else to put this, so: How does one create one of those forms for public Slacks that auto-invites people who put their email address?
U107N3ZJS : <@U21U8SZ2P> there are a few open source projects like <https://github.com/rauchg/slackin>
U0U32UM43 : <@U21U8SZ2P> In addition to Slackin, there are a few other options to deploy an invite page (<https://github.com/outsideris/slack-invite-automation> is one).Also, I've been working on an app that will give you a hosted (ie, you don't need a server as with Slackin) invite landing page, and you can choose to allow invites to get automatically sent, or you can manually moderate. Take a look, <https://www.topsail.io>, and let me know if you have any questions about how it works.

U3S76QAMQ : Unrelated, but does anyone know the type of data storage Slack uses? SQL or NoSQL?
U107N3ZJS : i've heard mysql
U107N3ZJS : with redis for some stuff
U3S76QAMQ : Thanks <@U107N3ZJS> 
U0HUTFBHS : This is a good write-up <@U3S76QAMQ> <https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/slack/>
U42ERK879 : hi guys, just started today with botkit. short question: I run the pizza example but convo.ask(...) doesn't wait for my response and goes all the conversation at once.  any idea why?
U3Y0G664R : Ah, we're not going to use it for general knowledge, more spesific for each course/class with depth into the topic at hand for lectures and papers connected to those. Testing a few ideas at the moment, if it shows to not be efficient we'll have to look at other options. Thanks for the reply.
U21U8SZ2P : <@U107N3ZJS> <@U0U32UM43> thank you both! Will look into these.
U392A23SP : hello! does anyone know if Botkit supports displaying checklists the same way you display buttons?
U0KECURAT : what
U392A23SP : like, displaying a list of 5 checkboxes and the user can select any number of them before hitting a submit button
U1DM2B4SY : not only does botkit not support it, neither does Slack as far as I know
U0V93GE5R : right, people usually fake it using emoji  :white_check_mark: :ballot_box_with_check:
U392A23SP : haha, cool
U0V93GE5R : using interactive buttons
U1DM2B4SY : <@U42ERK879> that can happen if you're running the bot as the same user that you initiated the conversation with. The folks over at <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> should be able to help more than the general channel
U392A23SP : thanks, guys!
U3VCWCPV5 : Is there a good forum to search for potential FAQs for? I'm just getting started and ... kinda want to take a real good stab at RTFM
U0V93GE5R : I would start with this starter kit: <https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/botkit-is-better-with-slacks-events-api-f9a27e051591#.qqgw31wyr>
U0V93GE5R : and feel free to ask questions here, or search the history,
U3ZQ6TZEG : Hey guys~ I need your experience. When you develop slack app, how do you make local development environment for debug or running the endpoints? This app always requires trusted-SSL so I always have to deploy the code first to see the logs. It's really uncomfortable.
U0V93GE5R : its best to have multiple apps for that purpose, so you can test internally with one set of tokens and then push the code to your production bot with another
U3VCWCPV5 : <@U0V93GE5R> thanks for the link. I've already got a hubot up and running. What I want to do is enable users to provide feature requests. But maybe that will be easier with the botkit resources, I'll look into it. Sadly I'm not having much luck with searching history.
U3ZQ6TZEG : <@U0V93GE5R> but how?? How does the app invoke your computer with trusted SSL?
U3ZQ6TZEG : <@U0V93GE5R> is it possible to have trusted certificate SSL on you computer??
U0V93GE5R : yep, look at localtunnel or ngrok
U0V93GE5R : you can stand up a ssl endpoint locally for testing purposes
U0V93GE5R : you can also use a private gomix account <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack>
U3ZQ6TZEG : wow.. now i am trying ngrok. downloaded the installation file and run it..;; but why was antivirus activated?? it just automatically deleted the file~!!!!!
U0V93GE5R : ngrok is legit, id suspect its a false positive.
U3ZQ6TZEG : kaspersky is killing me..;; it keeps deleting it..;;
U0HUTFBHS : I had an anti-virus delete a game because it sent data out.
U0HUTFBHS : Either whitelist ngrok, or spend a couple of bucks on a virtual private server.
U0V93GE5R : or use gomix until you outgrow it
U242G0ZAP : roberttod: <@U1X1Y2NN8> didn't we have this issue before? I think you had solved it.
U437YUERL : hey guys, thanks for letting me in
U437YUERL : Just have one question that- Im new to botkit but I want to know the best way to implement a botkit bot onto a website chat? I can only see integration for the popular messaging platforms. Thanks
U0KECURAT : <@U437YUERL> you mean through one of the integrations? You'll have to do that custom
U437YUERL : Thanks <@U0KECURAT>, I thought....so, use botkit then integrate into node/react inside the website? Would be great if there was a library out there already for making pretty at least
U0KECURAT : nope, the other way around. botkit takes care of the slack/messenger/whatever-it-integrates-with part
U0KECURAT : You'll have to write your own for the website :slightly_smiling_face:
U437YUERL : oh snap. well thats much harder. Is that why i don't see a lot of them and people just direct to use on their messenger/slack etc platform?
U437YUERL : Microsoft seem to have something that would help if I built through them -  <https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat>
U0KECURAT : haven't tried the microsoft thing, but it's not too hard to build your own ¯\_(?)_/¯
U437YUERL : <@U0KECURAT>, is it asking too much for a bit more info on what you mean (I'm a data guy, the other guy is the dev guy)
U0KECURAT : Sure, let's do it in a PM though
U3ES7AM6X : thought this would help. If you are using rasa_nlu the native format is a bit difficult to use. I wanted something more simple and like the <http://API.ai|API.ai> synonym model so I built the rasa model generator to create learning models. <https://gist.github.com/claytantor/ddaa1dbb1d4ce7ac8182b9bf2481d3b8>
U3ES7AM6X : also just saw this if you are using ML shared models. This is what dronze should be using. It solves the shared model problem. “DeepMind's PathNet: A Modular Deep Learning Architecture for AGI” @IntuitMachine <https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/pathnet-a-modular-deep-learning-architecture-for-agi-5302fcf53273>
U0RRCPDK9 : Looking for examples for web-based bots, and websites that rely on a conversational UI.
U43CE8ELX : hello guys, I'm having this strange problem that it gives me this error `Unhandled rejection SlackRTMError: invalid channel id` when I try to send a message…here is my code:```
var rtm = new RTMClient(bot_token);


rtm.on(CLIENT_EVENTS.RTM.AUTHENTICATED, function (rtmStartData) {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${rtmStartData.self.name} of team ${rtmStartData.team.name}!`);
});


rtm.on(RTM_CLIENT_EVENTS.RTM_CONNECTION_OPENED, function () {
  rtm.sendMessage("Hello!", '#general');
});

rtm.start();
```

U43CE8ELX : i copied exactly what they have basically in the nodeJS initializing a bot site: <https://slackapi.github.io/node-slack-sdk/bots#initializing-a-bot>
U1DM2B4SY : The problem is here: rtm.sendMessage("Hello!", '#general'); That argument takes a channel id, not a channel name
U43CE8ELX : I thought that may be the problem, but then I saw this: `var channel = "#general"; //could also be a channel, group, DM, or user ID (C1234), or a username (<@U0D7LHNTX>)`If it's not true, how do I get a channel ID?

U1DM2B4SY : hmm interesting.  <#C0K8617D5|slack-api> might be a more focused spot for this question
U43CE8ELX : oh ok thanks, I didn't have access to <#C0K8617D5|slack-api> :smile:
U0K4TM8N8 : Not interested in your spammy DM's <@U0L8LLD99> :disappointed:
U0K4TM8N8 : Even more so because you *did* spam me
U0V93GE5R : And he has dnd turnt on.  Super bad form <@U0L8LLD99> 
U2VMTE1FD : i cant tell if you guys are talking in a jamaican accent or not
