U14Q8S4EM : I think Ive been in your circumstance. I had an app that I wanted to listen for the enter key. There are a few ways to do it, but I ended up with..```
input
    [ onChange HandleField
    , onEnter HandleEnter
    , value model.inputField
    ]
    []

onEnter : Msg -&gt; Attribute Msg
```

U14Q8S4EM : It fired that message if the key that was pressed was the enter, and then separately, there was another event listener that listened for the changes generally
U14Q8S4EM : When you say "format the input field", you might like change or update?
U0JBSEGHY : I think I should hold 3 different states in the model. The current state of input, the state of the formatted number (human) and then the state of the number for international calling format.
U0JBSEGHY : I'm going to have a crack at what you have just outlined there. I just reread the code and it makes sense now haha
U0JBSEGHY : <@U14Q8S4EM> how does your HandleField work? Does it accept a string?
U0JBSEGHY : ```The 1st and 2nd entries in this list are different types of values.
327|                         [ onInput FormatNumber
328|&gt;                        , onChange HandleField
329|                         , value model.numberToCall
330|                         , placeholder "Enter a Phone Number"
331|                         , class "login-form"
332|                         ]

The 1st entry has this type:

    Attribute (Msg)

But the 2nd is:

    Attribute (String -&gt; Msg)```

U0JBSEGHY : If I remove the first input field it throws errors all the way down the view. So I'm a little stuck on the types.
U14Q8S4EM : Yeah, accepting a string is what I had in mind.
U14Q8S4EM : So.. `type Msg = HandleField String | ...`

U3HQVHERX : it says "emitted bundle.js" but i do not see it anywhere
U14Q8S4EM : Although I would name it something other than `HandleField`, maybe something more specific to what you are doing
U0JBSEGHY : Yea I am just trying to get it to compile for me first
U0JBSEGHY : The thing is having `HandleField String` throws errors on all my `onClick` handlers
U0JBSEGHY : That is once I remove the `onInput`
U0JBSEGHY : ```The 2nd and 3rd entries in this list are different types of values.
325|                 [ Html.form []
326|                     [ input
327|                         [ onChange HandleField
328|                         , value model.numberToCall
329|                         , placeholder "Enter a Phone Number"
330|                         , class "login-form"
331|                         ]
332|                         []
333|                     ]
334|                 , h4 [] [ text model.numberToCall ]
335|&gt;                , button [ onClick (MakeCall model.numberToCall) ] [ text "Make Call" ]
336|                 ]

The 2nd entry has this type:

    Html (String -&gt; Msg)

But the 3rd is:

    Html (Msg)```

U14Q8S4EM : Thats weird. What is `MakeCall`?
U14Q8S4EM : Whats the type?
U0JBSEGHY : ```type Msg    = Answer String
    | MakeCall String```

U0JBSEGHY : ```update...            MakeCall number -&gt;
            ( model, call number )
```

U14Q8S4EM : I dont know why you are getting that error. Thats weird.
U14Q8S4EM : This wont solve your problem, but you could also do `Msg = MakeCall | ..`
U14Q8S4EM : and then in your update do `(model, call model.numberToCall)`
U0JBSEGHY : This is my `onChange` ```onChange : msg -&gt; Attribute msgonChange message =
    on "keydown" (JD.succeed message)

```

U14Q8S4EM : What happens if you exclude the second element, does it compile?
