Your last option is going to be my approach for the current users and for the new ones I will implement a better flow email capture option or post as a bot in a channel
hey, does anyone know how to get discounts on slack? I'm doing a workshop were everyone builds a bot. That means a lot of people + integrations, but only for two days or so. Thoughts?
Been a while since I was reading, but I'm pretty sure they have a clause in their contracts for nonprofits

<https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204368833>
Also - Where can I find a list of error messages from SlackAPI (*example:* `cannot_dm_bot`)
Does anyone know if <https://slack.com/api/api.test> returns false if the api is down?
Logically... you'd get a timeout (or a lack of response) from your own end. - therefore it would be `false`
Pretty sure you'll also get a rtm_close event
Was having an argument with my own bot about how to make that work a few hours ago, will come back to it
denistsoi: fair enough.  I'm trying to write some monitoring checks that alert us when there are issues on the slack platform. <http://status.slack.com|status.slack.com> is fine until you want a computer to read the status and report on it... :disappointed:
The RSS/Atom feeds that <http://StatusPage.io|StatusPage.io> tell you plenty about what's happening but don't appear to state when an incident is closed or what the current status is
I mean, not sure what you're going to do with a status. Not like you're gonna post a message to your slack team about it.
I'd just start a reconnect timer and hope for the best
I think <@U0HNY2V47>  might want to check if the api is down (say the bot is up but slack is down)...
	which is fine - but then again... you wouldn't be able to respond within `slack`
:smile:
This has been prompted by the GitHub outage overnight - we now monitor github via <http://dataloop.io|dataloop.io> (monitoring as a service) and we are starting to pull together a dashboard that shows us the status of our external providers
<@U0HNY2V47>: Never.
I want to add the slack platform to that so we can understand via our monitoring where problems with connectivity might lie
you could always use pingdom?
I could, but then I need to setup something to monitor Pingdom as well... :wink:

lol - hahaha
I basically want a single dashboard that shows me the status of GitHub, PagerDuty/OpsGenie, Pingdom/StatusCake, Slack etc. so we know whether our business will be affected by a third-party outage
GitHub seems to be easier than everyone else :disappointed:
forgive the repost, but <http://doics.co/2016/01/28/when-github-goes-down/> explains it in more detail :simple_smile:
i probably wouldn't couple your monitoring into slack too tightly - (only use slack as a messaging end point) -
Slack is not the destination for these alerts, it's the source.  "Is Slack Up? Yes/No" is all I'm after
but in a way that means I don't have to scrape <http://status.slack.com|status.slack.com> looking for a specific image (or worse, a specific CSS Class!)
