Hi! How come ```Html.div [] [ text "foo \n bar" ]``` doesn't put bar on a new line but does remove the `\n`
I'd like it to but bar on a new line
That's how it works in regular HTML too. you'll want `Html.div [] [ text "foo", <http://Html.br|Html.br> [] [], text "bar" ]`
Ok right. In my case I get a string of css from elm-css that I'd like to render on the page, but with the linebreaks
Oh. You might want to use `Html.pre [] [ text yourStuff ]` then, which will render it into a "pre"formatted block
Ah! Nice :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks!
