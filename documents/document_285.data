U153UK3FA : Does the request actually succeed?
U153UK3FA : You should add some code to your Err case to display something if the request fails so it doesn't silently fail
U5ABF3BH7 : I get 404 in the console
U5ABF3BH7 : I don't know why it is failing.
U153UK3FA : Lots of context the web server can use to give a different response
U153UK3FA : Do you control the server?
U5ABF3BH7 : I stupidly forgot to add .json on the url!
U5ABF3BH7 : Sadly, it is still not worker. <@U153UK3FA>, I am not sure what you mean by if I control the server. I control the json url (through frontend controller)
U5ABF3BH7 : ^ not working
U236M9FH9 : <@U5ABF3BH7> Open up the network tab of devtools &amp; look at the differences of each request, might be some headers you need to add
U5ABF3BH7 : Could it be that a decoder calling another one messes the http.requestLooking at the error, it looks like the url is added twice. I get```No route matches [GET] "/cases/frontend/cases/frontend/all_rolodex.json"```. . I created a decoder for a list that is not nested, and it works fine.
U236M9FH9 : Try putting a leading slash before `cases` in the URL?
U236M9FH9 : Adding Decode.list shouldn't have anything to do with a double URL :confused: The decoder is used after the response is received...
U5ABF3BH7 : Oh, you are right :slightly_smiling_face:
U23SA861Y : see it's not json decoding thats hard, it's browsers :stuck_out_tongue:
U153UK3FA : values relative to context
U5Z6Q8Q9L : Hi all :slightly_smiling_face:
U5Z6Q8Q9L : I'm looking into frontend stuff and I was wondering if I could get an opinion -
U5Z6Q8Q9L : I'm building a webapp with rails, and I'm looking towards frontend.  In the past I've used pure JS (which can be a pain).  I've been experimenting with React, and while it's cool, I feel like it's a bit overkill (not to mention if the end-user doesn't enable JS, the whole page breaks).  I was looking into integrating elm with existing HTML (instead of replacing everything with elm), which seems to be possible with Elm embeds.   However I'm a little confused as to how they interact.  Can different elm embeds interact with each other?  For instance, if I were to have a persistent audio player similar to the one on soundcloud, could I make that audio player an embed, but have multiple controls for that component in other embeds?  Hopefully that makes sense...

U0PBSF05S : <@U5Z6Q8Q9L> Each embedded Elm app would be separate and they would need to communicate using ports just like they would have to if they were communicating with any other JS application. You will need a thin layer of JS in the middle that will coordinate the messages between the various Elm apps that you have. It is quite doable.
U153UK3FA : <@U5Z6Q8Q9L> of course you can do the same thing with React
U153UK3FA : I wouldn't worry to much about people having JS disabled
U5Z6Q8Q9L : <@U0PBSF05S> would that solution still allow me to take advantage of stuff like subscriptions and models (like in the clock example)?
U0PBSF05S : <@U5Z6Q8Q9L> Yes, standard Elm and in fact incoming ports will come via subscriptions.
U5Z6Q8Q9L : do you happen to have any resources on that subject?  I can't seem to find much of use but perhaps I'm looking in the wrong places/with the wrong keywords.
U0PBSF05S : <@U5Z6Q8Q9L> Are you talking about ports? I would start here if you haven't read this already: <https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html>
U5Z6Q8Q9L : Ah, thanks!
U0JL9RPC4 : that reminds me this Elm Europe talk about microservices
U2M8ER12B : elm noob, so i have no idea... dropbox marketing page has this code:```
window.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    'use strict';
    for (var elm = event.target; elm; elm = elm.parentElement) {
        if (elm.id &amp;&amp;
            window._goch_.hasOwnProperty(elm.id) &amp;&amp;
            window._goch_[elm.id].call(elm, event) === false) {
            event.preventDefault();
        }
    }
}, true);
```

U2M8ER12B : is that an elm signature?
U3SJEDR96 : no, that's just `elm` as short for `element`
U2M8ER12B : ha, ooops
U3SJEDR96 : yeah, their website is mostly react
U5YJVL3B7 : hey elmos
U5YJVL3B7 : I'm trying to understand this:```
type alias Html msg = Node msg
```
from the Html package

U5YJVL3B7 : where does `Node` comes from?
U3SJEDR96 : from the `VirtualDom` package
U3SJEDR96 : similarly, `type alias Svg msg = Node msg`. That is to say; they both use virtual-dom nodes under the hood :slightly_smiling_face:
