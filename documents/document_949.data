U4Y1DSTGD : Hello everybody, I have a problem with REACT-ROUTER, anybody can help me?
U4NK2CJS1 : hi friend
U4NK2CJS1 : I'm newer with reactjs
U4NK2CJS1 : and trying to edit todomvc application
U4NK2CJS1 : but it not changed when I edited the files
U4NK2CJS1 : did I missing something for rebuild the file ?

U3VGTE66T : hey guys
U3VGTE66T : does anyone know if react is considered oop?
U50P0P8L8 : Hey I’m having some trouble with `react-router` and `react-router-redux`
U50P0P8L8 : So I have this container with the following function ```const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) =&gt; {  return {
    onChange: (filterText) =&gt; {
        dispatch(push('/' + filterText));
    }
  }
}```

U50P0P8L8 : This works, in that it correctly changes the url
U50P0P8L8 : However as you may have guessed the url is `/(:filter)` and I’d like the filtered results to change along with the url.
U50P0P8L8 : Before I refactored this to be url based the dispatch simply updated the filter in the redux store, and that seemed to work just fine. How can I make sure the router also causes a re-render here?
U1BC67ULB : good afternoon all - i’m getting a mongoDB slack channel started if anyone is interested. <https://mongodbtalk.slack.com>
U532VLX8F : is there a cdn for using the propTypes now that it is departing from react core?
U52R82GHK : Hi everyone, I am total newb in react js, was trying to create a simple to do list and am stuck with this issue, can anyone please point me in the right direction: error 'Component' is not defined no-undef
U532VLX8F : do you happen to have a jsbin or plunker of it? I'd be happy to look at the code
U52PX39N2 : yeah a jsbin or plunkr would help but off the top of my head did you import component on that file?maybe this? 
import React, {Component} from ‘react’;

U538BRDJR : Hi, I have created one project using react js and i build that. After build it generated index.html, css, js files and it showed that run npm install -g serve and serve -s build commands. As atech guy i am having npm setup in my pc and i run commands application is working fine. I doubt is If i send build folder to someone, is it necessary to have thair pc with npm set up to check my web application?
U538BRDJR : please give me some suggestions. I am doing one online challange.
U538BRDJR : now
U52PX39N2 : <@U538BRDJR>  this is really late just seeing this, but if you have a build folder, my assumption without seeing it is that there should be no need for them to have npm. As long as the folder folder structure is setup - index.html { js.folder (app.js) , css.folder (style.css)
U52PX39N2 : maybe the serve was setting up a browser sync type environment?
U541H0G2U : do you have any good REST library to use with React? I liked backbone.js but I wish it was without the view part. Have anything similar.
U50P0P8L8 : I’d love to know that as well!
U50P0P8L8 : <https://github.com/mgcrea/redux-rest-resource> I’ve been looking at this one. Seems promising
U50P0P8L8 : Does anyone have experience with it?

U4AHQD19D : i still research this two lifecycle method for best place call action with axios request

U5E5JUQ5B : pls help
U5ERXDRSQ : jimmynanuan: First at all i would suggest you to format your code using ```. Please see <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages>. Then i think your function named `getSampleText` should be called on `componentDidMount`.
U5ERXDRSQ : The error Maximun call stack usually is throwed when you are trying to do `setState` inside a render function.
U5E5JUQ5B : thanks kenji
U5E5JUQ5B : what are the BASIC THINGS in ReactJS that we should remember before making any big project.. Plz tell me in detail
