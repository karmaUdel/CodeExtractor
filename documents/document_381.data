U3YDBDP4Z : Wondering if it's possible to see what the error was
U17MNKY3H : It'll have a string message AFAIR.
U17MNKY3H : An error `Result` can't really be created without a value.
U3YDBDP4Z : ```getResultValue result =
    case result of
        Ok value -&gt;
            value

        Err err -&gt;
            err
```
Says the type annotation should be `Result a a -&gt; a`

U3YDBDP4Z : Would have thought it could say `Result String String -&gt; String` or something
U17MNKY3H : Elm does that. It finds the most general type it can for a function.
U17MNKY3H : It will accept a less general one though.
U3YDBDP4Z : Ah, my annotation worked just as well :slightly_smiling_face:
U23SA861Y : your annotation can be more specific
U17MNKY3H : Better wording. :slightly_smiling_face:
U3YDBDP4Z : Hmm… Invalid JSON : Unexpected token t in JSON at position 53.```
json =
                        """
                        {
                          target: {
                            elements: {
                              email: {
                                value: "<mailto:jane@mail.com|jane@mail.com>"
                                }
                              }
                            }
                          }
                        """
```

U17MNKY3H : JSON needs to have string keys.
U17MNKY3H : `{ "target": ... }` vs `{ target: ... }`
U3YDBDP4Z : Doh
U17MNKY3H : :slightly_smiling_face:
U3YDBDP4Z : :clap:
U3YDBDP4Z : Sweet. Things are moving along!
U2DF486HL : Hi, how can convert a list of strings, into a single string with its values separeted by ", " ?
U2DF486HL : or a list of int to a single string separated by ","
U2DF486HL : I think this can work but not sure if it is the best... String.join "," (List.map (toString) a)
U23SA861Y : I believe there is a single built info for what you want
U4872964V : <@U2DF486HL> it's the best! 
U23SA861Y : ahh, yeah String.join is exactly what you want
U23SA861Y : the List.map is you constructing the list of stringsyou might also try:
```
List.map toString a
   |&gt; String.join ","
```

U23SA861Y : <@U2DF486HL> ^
U23SA861Y : becareful with toString though, if you thing is already a string it will insert quotes
U2DF486HL : Ok, I understand.. thank you <@U23SA861Y> and <@U4872964V>
U3YDBDP4Z : To pluralize or not pluralize module names…
U3YDBDP4Z : :thinking_face:
U23SA861Y : the stdlib seems to go with not pluralizing
U23SA861Y : with the exception of `Basics`
U3YDBDP4Z : I started with pluralized names, but now I'm leaning towards not
U23SA861Y : non-plural also reads nice when it's included in the signature like `Msg.map` as opposed to `Msgs.map`
