U3HQVHERX : integrating elm into django, csrf_token is a flag, any gotchyas? currently passing it along with POST requests as `csrfmiddlewaretoken` but still getting `{"detail":"CSRF Failed: CSRF token missing or incorrect."}`
U3YDBDP4Z : I'm trying to debug but I'm not getting anything to consoleFor instance, `let _ = Debug.log "OnLocationChange " location`

U3YDBDP4Z : Is that the correct way?
U3HQVHERX : that's correct
U3HQVHERX : <@U3YDBDP4Z> could you post the surrounding code? are you sure `OnLocationChange` is happening?
U3YDBDP4Z : I'm pretty sure since I can change the url and get a different view.But it's not the view I want, so that's what I'm trying to debug

U3YDBDP4Z : ```userRequired : Model -&gt; Navigation.Location -&gt; Models.Route
userRequired model location =
    case model.user of
        Nothing -&gt;
            let
                _ =
                    Debug.log "Nothing: " toString model.user
            in
                Models.SignInRoute

        Just user -&gt;
            let
                _ =
                    Debug.log "User " model.user
            in
                parseLocation location


update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; ( Model, Cmd a )
update msg model =
    case msg of
        ChangeLocation path -&gt;
            ( model, Navigation.newUrl path )

        OnLocationChange location -&gt;
            let
                _ =
                    Debug.log "OnLocationChange " location
            in
                ( { model | route = userRequired model location }, Cmd.none )
```

U3HQVHERX : Can you show me the code that that sends the `OnLocationChange` message?
U3YDBDP4Z : ```
init : Location -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init location =
    let
        currentRoute =
            Routing.parseLocation location
    in
        ( Models.initialModel currentRoute, Cmd.none )


main : Program Never Model Msg
main =
    Navigation.program Msgs.OnLocationChange
        { init = init
        , view = view
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        }

```
?

U3HQVHERX : so, i've got something like this in my code (I'm using that same navigation package)
U3HQVHERX : ```onLinkClick : msg -&gt; Attribute msg
onLinkClick message =
    let
        options =
            { stopPropagation = False
            , preventDefault = True
            }
    in
        onWithOptions "click" options (Decode.succeed message)
```

U3YDBDP4Z : Right.
U3HQVHERX : ```linkAttrs : String -&gt; List (Attribute Msg)
linkAttrs path =
    [ href &lt;| path, R.onLinkClick &lt;| UpdateLocation path ]
```

U3YDBDP4Z : I'm not clicking any links. This is on page load
U3YDBDP4Z : I get the "correct" views if I change the url, as if it doesn't even care about the `userRequired` function
U3YDBDP4Z : But none of the debug logs are being logged :confused:
U3YDBDP4Z : So I don't know what's going on!? :smile:
U3HQVHERX : oh, none of them are being logged??
U3YDBDP4Z : No
U3HQVHERX : Try putting one in your init
U3HQVHERX : just for a sanity check
U3HQVHERX : ```init : Location -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init location =
    let
        currentRoute =
            Routing.parseLocation location
        _ = Debug.log "loc" location
    in
        ( Models.initialModel currentRoute, Cmd.none )
```
