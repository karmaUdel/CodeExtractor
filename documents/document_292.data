But keep in mind that `now` gives you a `Task`, meaning getting the time is asynchronous.
<@U62V8HFJR> how does that Task turn into a string?
is there `succeed` ?
I'm sorry, but I don't get it. I try this on the repl but I get a type mismatch error:
<@U451CRP62> That's because `x` and `error` have different types
Elm is strongly typed, so you can't have variables that switch between `Float` or `String` willy-nilly like in Javascript or Python
so the result of `Ok x -&gt; &lt;VALUE&gt;` and `Err error -&gt; &lt;OTHER VALUE&gt;` will need to match
