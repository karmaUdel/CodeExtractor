U0CRS2WV9 : api gateway/lambda/dynamodb for us
U55GUAU7N : hi all! hope you're all having awesome days. quick question. is there a bot platform where you own your entire data set? or would it be best in your eyes to self develop?
U0V93GE5R : Checkout <#C4MJKM145|botkit_studio> 
U55B1LA4S : any of you using flask for bots??
U44G9V9GR : <@U3YKAK0NT>: Also got this yesterday evening (14 hours) ago. The bot was online for ~5-10 seconds before rebooting each time. I solved by going back to botkit 0.5.2 and then it worked. But today when I tried bumping the versions again, it seem to work on 0.5.3 again :clap:
U37C5V3HT : How to use `outgoing webhook url` in case of slack app as they've mentioned outgoing webhook won't work in case of slack `app` and suggested to use `Event Api`. But i was wondering how can i use the webhook url in event api. I'm not just thinking out loud.. any idea!
U07CW6N3A : you're right, outgoing webhooks aren't supported as part of a Slack app.
U07CW6N3A : Events API offers some similar functionality. The Request URL on _your server_  where Slack will deliver events is kind of like a "webhook URL". While you can't ask the events API to only notify that URL when certain text matches are found, you can subscribe to broader events and then filter and focus only on the events containing text you're interested in server-side, in your own code.
U4A0J4ARH : Hopefully I'm just missing something here, but it looks like since test token permissions were changed from 'MAX' to their current set, I can't use the test for users.identity at <https://api.slack.com/methods/users.identity/test>.
U4A0J4ARH : Anyone else have that issue?
U4A0J4ARH : Getting this:```
{
    "ok": false,
    "error": "missing_scope",
    "needed": "identity.basic",
    "provided": "read,client,admin,identify,post,apps"
}
```

U4A0J4ARH : Or possibly this particular call wants a different token supplied, since it's a token gen'd by a user OAuth?  (At least, it is in what I'm building.)
U07CW6N3A : I don't believe `users.identity` has ever allowed test tokens work against it.. if I remember right it will _only_ work with tokens negotiated via the Sign in with Slack process.
U0563E81H : <@U56L4MM9S> Please do not test or promote bots in public channels
U560ZJKJ4 : i get `{:ok false, :error channel_not_found}` today without no reason. I was sick about one weak and didn't touch code. Today i run this and bum, something broken during this time. But for sure not in my code. I send to the public channel `#logs`…. do you have similar problem?
U560ZJKJ4 : it works with channel `#ogolny` which is default one…. doesn't make sense
U560ZJKJ4 : is it slack bug?
U560ZJKJ4 : oh so i can send message with `C4ETK8***` id but not as a name… strange
U0V93GE5R : Is you bot invited to those channels  
U560ZJKJ4 : this is public channel, it is not boot but app so probably can't be as user in channel, i use `OAuth Access Token`. It was working one weak ago.
U560ZJKJ4 : i can only imagine it is temporary slack bug
U560ZJKJ4 : not really sure what i can do with that more now to debug it?
U560ZJKJ4 : or something changed and app have to be as a member of the channel now to find the channel even is see this channel when list channels? :neutral_face:
U560ZJKJ4 : i created new public channel and it works… but it doesn't with the old one hmm
U560ZJKJ4 : oh i can event send message to private channel, but not to exactly this one public channel…
U560ZJKJ4 : unless i use ID instead of #name
U560ZJKJ4 : *i solved it: i renamed channel #logs to #logs2 and again from #logs2 to #logs. Now it works. That was definitely slack bug.*
U56L4MM9S : <@U0563E81H> sorry. I thought iy wouldnt work
U55B1LA4S : i want to show the presence status of my team member by green dot in slack, i got the status of all the users by  users.getPresence but how to show it like green dot?
U0V93GE5R : :green_heart: maybe?
U540NK0HJ : What is the best sub channel for pure python chatbot/app questions?
U0V93GE5R : we have a few
U0V93GE5R : <#C0J3CL5V1|language-python> <#C1HK27SVD|sdk-hubot-slack> <#C1HJWSCL8|sdk-python-slackclien> are the most popular but neither are that active
U540NK0HJ : Thank you, trying the language-python, are there better methods/forums for Q&amp;A?
U0V93GE5R : Sorry, I can only speak for bot related resources here.. good luck!
U540NK0HJ : Would an auth token question for general use in any BOT API be ok?
U0V93GE5R : Just feel free to ask questions here :wink: We have <#C0K8617D5|slack-api> if its slack specific, and <#C11Q41CR3|fb-messenger>
U540NK0HJ : I created a Custom Integration Bot, got it's token, used it successfully for two way communication in the RTM method with SlackClient. Learned that I should migrate to App/Bot-User Event driven Webhooks, so I deleted the CI bot, made and App with a Bot User, added my Events and wrote an event handler with Flask, and the new App Token matched what I got from the Events, yay! But then using the SlackClient API to send return messages (or even try the api.test method) fails auth with that token.
U540NK0HJ : Hrmmm, I may have found my problem.. it appears 90% of the google searches say that the API Token is available only in Custom Integrations. And that certain apps like Hubot can also regenerate API tokens. so I have the wrong token type in my APP's basic Info page.. I need an API Token. Any idea how to get one associated with my APP?
U0FHTRT7F : <@U0HRR8P8S> I am following this thread , faced this issue yesterday
U540NK0HJ : <@U0FHTRT7F> After searching how other Bots did this, sadly they use Custom Integration bots to get their API Token. I resurrected my CI Bot, and I am just going to code my bot using the RTM method. Wanted to use the current APP/Bot-User way, but just can't do the simple things I need a Bot to do using that method. Gotta say, Cisco's Spark API was a bit cleaner.
U0FHTRT7F : <@U0HRR8P8S>  thank you for sharing, I will keep you posted on what I do, going to get to it shortly
U4HG47ZGD : dopeboy: i would start with Heroku and Mongo. thats what we are doing, it was super easy 1-click and go.
U4U6P9L1M : Hey, umm how come a conversation runs or seems to run not in the sequence of a user answering questions/giving responses. e.g if I print something in a conversation it prints even before the conversation has started on the user side
U4U6P9L1M : Which part of the docs have I ,issed
U04SM6T2H : <@U4U6P9L1M> I can explain it to you in a but long story short: the conversations are queues. 
U4U6P9L1M : <@U04SM6T2H> I have read about the event loop in JS and callbacks and so I expect a callback function to be added to the end of the queue
U4U6P9L1M : but this isn't what happens
U4U6P9L1M : I see callbacks added to the top of queues
U4U6P9L1M : Ok so start conversation creates a new queue
U4U6P9L1M : but the callbacks in a thread
U4U6P9L1M : `startConversation`
U4U6P9L1M : The callbacks just seem to be random
U04SM6T2H : Callback on the ask?
U4U6P9L1M : Yes callbacks like:
```
  convo.addQuestion("Who are we?",
                    ({text}, conversation) =&gt; {
                      convo.next();
                    },
                    {},
                    'skip_yes'
                   );
  convo.addQuestion("What are we?",
                    ({text}, conversation) =&gt; {
                      secondConversation(null, convo);
                      convo.next();
                    },
                    {}
                   );

```

U4U6P9L1M : The callback that is the second arg to `addQuestion`
U4U6P9L1M : I think I should just read more about  callbacks
U4U6P9L1M : Wait, also.
U4U6P9L1M : It seems if I added a print statement somewhere in the conversation
U4U6P9L1M : It is run before I kick off the conversation in e.g messenger
U4U6P9L1M : then when I run the conversation as a person it gets set to null
