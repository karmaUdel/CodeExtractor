Sure
I guess `reduce` implies turning a list of values into a single value...
you could easily `reduce` into a larger list :slightly_smiling_face:
The random module is weird
I feel like I'm using message passing wrong. Anybody want to have a look? I'm not sure how to explain it other than this gist: <https://gist.github.com/vikfroberg/31e1c0eae7bc425c632987b0d64e07da>
I need to provide a random seed in order to get a random number?
<@U6DQCTZT2> you could use `Html.map`
wait, you mention that, nvm
<@U0JFXEUCT> maybe I don't understand how Html.map fully. But wouldn't that forward AddTodo to Page.update?
so, I personally solve this by having a `Common` msg type that I keep separate from both Page and Main
ultimately, yeah
`Html.map` just calls that constructor on all the event msgs of the view
You've checked out the `elm-spa-example`?
there's also a great talk about growing elm code, by Richard Feldman at Elm Europe
I've seen he's elm-spa-example
But haven't seen the talk
I'll have a look thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U0JFXEUCT> wait, I've seen it lol :stuck_out_tongue: Do you mind sharing more about your Common type?
lol, awesome
for instance, can I import the JS Math lib and use Math.random
