(well - perhaps it is obvious and I'm just not totally converted to reading the Elm way of typing and spec'ing the syntax)
Hello! Does anyone have a very basic example in Elm of an app with new page, edit page, index page, etc.. (ruby on Rails platform with controllers, etc..). I am getting a bit lost in the complexity of the examples I see.
I have all the data from the backend, that I decode into my Model.  I want to use the view of my FirstCallNew, I don't know how to enter that in
