```
`{ anon: String }` is anonymous, i.e it has no name
It's still a useful bug report
But generally you want to avoid anon types like that :slightly_smiling_face:
Why would i want to avoid that? i don't understand
Because it makes it harder to explain what that piece of your program is.
`model.sliderOptions.rgbo`
Imagine you want to make a function that only works on that piece of the data
what about this is hard to access?
It's not hard to access - it's hard to understand.
oh do you mean the name is bad?
Imagine you want to have a function that takes `rgbo` and returns a new `rgbo`
Well, the name might be bad, but that's not my point
hmm, these are just flags
not data that will be transformed
