U1LPGS4P8 : <@U0HUTFBHS>: Fantastic info, thanks!
U0HUTFBHS : <@U1LPGS4P8>: I hope you have fun on your upcoming adventures in persistence.  :slightly_smiling_face:
U1LPGS4P8 : It's overwhelming, and exciting at the same time. I just have to keep pushing when I get stuck.
U1N9A583E : Hey guys I'm building a bot that evaluates/runs code for multiple programming languages.
Just wondering if I can have the same server have endpoints for both a facebookbot and slackbit, or do they need to be separate instances?

U1N9A583E : I'm using howdy's botkit btw
U04SM6T2H : Right now they need to be separate
U1N9A583E : That's fine I guess, using now.sh, shouldn't be hard
U1LPQMFDH : Hello everyone, now after i integrate my website RSS with slack to display new feeds , can i change the way and the format of new feeds that displayed in slack channel? , can i make new format or style to dispaly this feeds ?
U1040DS93 : Hey, How can i upload gif to slack? i was able to upload only text files.
U0HUTFBHS : Throw the image into the link bit and it works for me.
U0HUTFBHS : e.g. ```      { response_type: 'in_channel',        text: image['link'],
      }.to_json
```

U0HUTFBHS : Oh, the text bit I meant to say.
U181JHTL1 : Happy 4th! :fireworks:Question for the Slack devs here. Why is `username` not available in the `users.identity` api call? I'd imagine people would want access to the username when signing in with Slack.

U1LQ8N7UZ : For any Melbourne based bot enthusiasts there's a hackathon on this weekend! Details here: <http://www.meetup.com/Chatbots-Messaging-and-AI-Melbourne/events/232127393/>
U16USBQBH : Hey everyone, gearing up for ProductHunt tomorrow. Looking for a few good people who can help me test out our Slack bot before we pull the trigger. You will need Stripe account to test it correctly. Nerves are kicking in! Please hit me up if interested.
U1NSE6M3N : Hi Guys, We have started building our Eva Bot app on slack using Botkit. We are done with the basic setup. Can you please help us out with the below points:1. We want to ask user to save card details. Is it somehow possible to integrate stripe's save card pop-up in the bot flow?

2. What are the available options to ask user to enter card details and save them.

U0KECURAT : <@U1NSE6M3N>: that's probably something you will want to handle outside of slack
U1NSE6M3N : <@U0KECURAT>: yes we are doing it outside of slack anyway. I was just wondering if someone has implemented any payment gateway or save card feature via slack app !
U0KECURAT : I've seen some bots that do payment over slack, but I think they all handle that sort of sensitive info outside of slack, not sure though ¯\_(?)_/¯
U1NSE6M3N : can you name them please?
U0KECURAT : I don't remember them off the top of my head, sorry
U1NSE6M3N : Ok. no issue. Thanks for the clarity on this topic.
U0KECURAT : <@U1NSE6M3N>: i guess this is one <https://acme-read.slack.com/apps/A0F1SCVS6-changetip>
U0KECURAT : <https://acme-read.slack.com/apps/category/At0EFX9EF9-payments-accounting>
U1NSE6M3N : <@U0KECURAT>: thanks:+1:
U0V93GE5R : might try <#C0K8617D5> if you run into more problems as well
U0V93GE5R : We have a few more seats left for a closed beta of new Howdy features, come join us in <#C0J4J90NM> if you want to add your team.
U18HVKW5P : is there a slack api method for retrieving the user id of a user given their username?
U1P4EBP5L : <@U18HVKW5P> you can use users.list (<https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list>) to find all users in team and then compare there username.
U1P6H6M6U : has anybody tried to set up an api that deals with interactive messages (buttons)?
U1P6H6M6U : my configured endpoint isn't getting called
U1P6H6M6U : of note is that the endpoint does work with slash commands
U1P6H6M6U : it seems I'm not getting the POST
U0HUNC8PR : Do you have the call back id given correctly in the attachment
U1P6H6M6U : nginx access and error logs aren't showing any activity
U0HUNC8PR : Check Slack (chrome error console) in the webapp to see if there is a exception
U1P6H6M6U : <@U0HUNC8PR>: good one!
U1P6H6M6U : thanks
U1P6H6M6U : so used to being in the app that I haven't thought of that
U0HUNC8PR : i had a similar error :slightly_smiling_face:
U1P6H6M6U : just getting `api call "chat.attachmentAction" not ok`
U1P6H6M6U : in the javascript console
U0HUNC8PR : check the network response..i am guessing you didnt give the call back id
U0HUNC8PR : it will have the exact exception
U1P6H6M6U : no different error:
U1P6H6M6U : `"Darn – that didn't work. Only Slack Apps can add interactive elements to messages. Manage your apps here: &lt;https://api.slack.com/apps/&gt;”`
U0HUNC8PR : Ok..you need to wrap inside an app..custom integrations wont work with messages
U1P6H6M6U : my bot is an app though
U1P6H6M6U : but I have a separate API server that is going to handle the POST messages (different process)
U1P6H6M6U : don't think that should matter though
U1P6H6M6U : yeah the bot is definitely wrapped in an app
U1P6H6M6U : (just checked)
U0HUNC8PR : hmm..that seems weird...<https://api.slack.com/docs/message-buttons#readying_your_application_for_message_buttons>
U1P6H6M6U : my bot should show up as a ‘custom integration' I'm assuming
U1P6H6M6U : or should it be installed similar to the ‘official' apps?
U1P6H6M6U : It's not something I want to distribute (yet)
U0HUNC8PR : it should show up as App..it wont be distributed by default...
U1P6H6M6U : odd, it is showing up in this list: <https://api.slack.com/apps/>
U1P6H6M6U : I can only imagine that the bot is misconfigured
U1P6H6M6U : or something
U1P6H6M6U : but it only needs the API token
U1P6H6M6U : and it was successful in posting the message with all the buttons, not just the clicking of the buttons
U0HUNC8PR : yes.button posting would work even in custom integration...just that callbacks wont workI am not sure what wrong to be exact..but only thing which i think of trying is actually install your app in your own slack using addToSlack

U1KH878SJ : <@U1P6H6M6U>: Also, I think the endpoint url needs to be HTTPS.
U1P6H6M6U : <@U1KH878SJ>: yeah got that all set up, thanks though!
U0HUNC8PR : <https://dev4slack.slack.com/apps/manage> Does your app show in custom or app in this link
U0HUNC8PR : (in your slacksubdomain link )
U1P6H6M6U : custom
U0HUNC8PR : it should be in app i think..at least thats how my setup is
U1P6H6M6U : but does that mean you submitted it?
U1P6H6M6U : sort of curious if there's an easy way to just install it for my team
U0HUNC8PR : no... AddToSlack is just a button..you can use it internally before submission
U1P6H6M6U : and start debugging it etc
U0HUNC8PR : there is no review etc to use that button for yourself
U1P6H6M6U : got it
U1P6H6M6U : I understand
U1P6H6M6U : sort of interesting process
U0K7U9LUC : Does anyone here have an idea about a gateway between slack and discourse forum? Any project around this topic?
U1292LZFC : Hey all, I've kicked off a bit of a discussion in <#C11V3QWCD> - comments most welcome!
U0J4JAN3F : Shared my thoughts on designing for commerce conversations: <https://chatbotsmagazine.com/designing-commerce-botversations-8c39215ddfa0#.1vwd1sjew>
U1PD9M0BV : Has anyone been able to get a button in a slack message to do anything?  Ive seen plenty of examples of buttons but they never do anything.
U1LPGS4P8 : <@U1PD9M0BV>: <@U0DSTH2HL> has a clever game that uses the buttons.
U1PGQ2AGL : hello all
U1PGQ2AGL : i am new to making slackbots
U1PGQ2AGL : however i want to make a bot where my bot gets data from a stored JSON file
U1PGQ2AGL : based on keywords
U1PGQ2AGL : has anyone worked on that before
U1PGQ2AGL : ?
U1PGQ2AGL : can anyone help me with that
U1PGQ2AGL : ?
U1N9A583E : You can use howdyai botkit for node.
U1N9A583E : <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit>
U1PGQ2AGL : <@U1N9A583E>: Thank u
U1N9A583E : yw
U1EP0GH2T : Hello, does anyone know how to customize the file import menu from a slack app ? (like dropbox app)
U0GT29N3A : <@U1EP0GH2T>: Pretty sure you can't, only native apps can access this.
U1PJALJKE : Hey - I'm following the instructions on this page here: <https://blog.howdy.ai/botkit-interactive-messages-d3a4eaaf1ef0#.g2wxumcg0>
U1PJALJKE : and I'm having trouble getting the hello world to work.
U1PJALJKE : When configuring "Interactive Messages", I'm setting the request url to localhost:8080/slack/receive
U1PJALJKE : is this correct?
U1PJALJKE : Thanks for the help!
U0GT29N3A : <@U1PJALJKE>: When you say "configuring interactive messages" do you mean the settings of your application in Slack?
U1PJALJKE : yep
U0GT29N3A : This is not correct then. This is the URL Slack should call when someone click on a button. But from the Slask servers, this won't work.
U0GT29N3A : You need Ngrok or localtunnel to create a public URL that redirects to your local instance.
U1PJALJKE : gotch
U1PJALJKE : I'm actually using <http://localtunnel.me|localtunnel.me>
U1PJALJKE : figured that part out
U1PJALJKE : Would you be free to jump into a screenshare?
U1PJALJKE : I'm in a bit of a jam with a demo due in a bit
U1PJALJKE : I'm able to get the oauth endpoints working but can't seem to hit the 'interactive_message_callback' endpoint :disappointed:
U0LKH699P : are there any slack rooms people are talking about developing for Facebook messenger? there's a very quiet <#C0HKBJ0HY> channel here...
U1HK4CCRM : `<http://localtunnel.me|localtunnel.me>` interesting... I've been using `ngrok`
U0JPS3SHX : in my experience `ngrok` is more stable than localtunnel and paying to have a fix subdomain was probably the best investment ive done in a while
U0JPS3SHX : specially for slack, that way you dont need to change your urls all the time
U0XPWD3NY : <@U0XPWD3NY|shandley14> set the channel topic: frontenddevelopers
U0XPWD3NY : <@U0XPWD3NY|shandley14> set the channel topic: dev4slack
U0LKH699P : i found also localtunnel a bit flaky when running standalone
U0LKH699P : but surprisingly the built in version as part of botkit seems to work really well.
U1E740LSV : <@U0LKH699P> there's <#C11Q41CR3>
U1E740LSV : ngrok all the way. worth every penny
U0LKH699P : $5 a month! jeez, i could buy a cup of coffee for that instead!
U1E740LSV : once you work more with localtunnel you will start to find that $5/month &gt; frustration
U0V93GE5R : yea besides $5 coffee is only what 3 hours of productivity tops? :wink:
U0LKH699P : frustrating how apps have trained us to think anything other than $0.99 is a rip off
U0LKH699P : wechat (china's facebook?) people use for P2P and shopping payments, so the avg. spend is about $20/month
U0LKH699P : <https://walkthechat.com/wechat-impact-report-2016/>
U0LKH699P : so people are more comfortable paying for stuff.
U0LKH699P : I hope FBM or Slack get a virtual currency working soon...
U0HBN0L9M : using localtunnel
U0HBN0L9M : it's falling from time to time
U0HBN0L9M : just a restart
U0HBN0L9M : not very frustrating, honestly
U1Q3HE7M1 : Has anyone had any issues with omniauth-slack and channels.list?
U1Q3HE7M1 : I'm trying to get a webhook url and a list of channels in one pass using a scope of 'channels.list,incoming-webhook' but am getting back 'OAuth Error: invalid_scope: Invalid scope channels:list'. Does anyone know the solution to this?
U0HUTFBHS : I just hit a slack limit.
U0HUTFBHS : <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12492300/Toomuchmagic.jpeg>
U0HUTFBHS : Just trying to catch up my phone.  :smile:
U1P6GBARJ : Hi all, I'm trying to initiate a conversation using startConversation(), this works but the convo.ask() inside doesn't seem to hear responses.  The whole thing is not wrapped in  a bot.hears() because I initiate the conversation based on a schedule, not user input.  Any ideas why I don't hear the responses?
U1P6GBARJ : Oh, I guess I should say this is for botkit!  The readme directed me to this slack team, but now I realise it's a general dev4slack team.
U1P6GBARJ : Hmm, if I try to use startPrivateConversation I get: bot.startPrivateConversation is not a function  - using botkit 0.2.2
U1116QM2Q : probably since the bot is not wrapped into the bot.hears method my guess is that whatever bot you are passing to the method that's invoking that startConversation method is not the correct one
U1116QM2Q : but why dont you try asking over at <#C0AV5N8NA>
U1116QM2Q : its a channel dedicated to botkit :slightly_smiling_face: <@U1P6GBARJ>
U1P6GBARJ : <@U1116QM2Q>: awesome, I will, thanks!
U0K7U9LUC : hi everyone. Anyone aware of a gateway between slack and telegram app ?
U0K7U9LUC : nothing listed in the API
U0K7U9LUC : something called ESPbot ?
U0K7U9LUC : found espbot
U0K7U9LUC : but between HO and telegram
U1QB7RXQQ : Hi I want to ask something how to add authentication button account for auth in our bot like dropbox apps
U13AU2JUA : i know this is a slack group, but i also know this is a group that uses botkit. Has anyone figured out how to send emojis through facebook?
U0LKH699P : some emoji have shortcuts like :heart:
U0LKH699P : `&lt;3`
U0LKH699P : but thats a good question
U13AU2JUA : <@U0LKH699P>: I figured it out. It was a problem in Botkit. I made a pull request
U0LKH699P : for some reason with FB messenger client, i can't cut/paste the raw emoji
U0LKH699P : like i could with telegram, wechat and other clients
U0LKH699P : are you sending codes, or `:thumbsup:`
U0LKH699P : type pseudocodes?
U1N97NEFM : What is the best way to have a bot attach an image retrieved from a URL? Right now I'm just having the bot build the URL and letting Slack unfurl the image but if there was a way to directly upload as an attachment without having the link in the message body that would be preferable. Thanks!
U0HUTFBHS : You can't send data through json.  Well, not without base64ing it.
U1QDV9MS9 : python jupyter did some evil awesome things with that...
U1QDV9MS9 : <http://jupyter.org/>
U1QDV9MS9 : massive overkill, but fun to reference if you are looking for getting data into strange places for strange reasons
U1QDV9MS9 : If you can screw with font-sizes, there are a surprisingly large number of text-formatting outputs in the extended unicode set output which may be of service
U1QDV9MS9 : if you are simply looking for decoration and not transmitting mission critical info
U1QFMDJUX : hi guys. I'm absolutely new to this. I've got some spare time and I want to build an integration that let's people split costs (inspired by LunchTrain and the introduction of Message Buttons). I'm not a dev - I'm a designer that knows the basics of coding. I decided to spend more time coding so this is what I wanna do. Can you guys link me to some articles/tutorials to get started? Much appreciated :slightly_smiling_face:
U0TGHKPEU : hello guys. I just have a question regarding the interactive buttons. Is it possible to response an ephemeral message with interactive buttons from a slash command initiation?
U06E352LU : <@U0TGHKPEU>:  from the doc```
Your application produces a message containing buttons. Maybe the message originated in response to an invoked slash command, or in response to a bot user's trigger phrase. Or maybe your app posted the message manually using an incoming webhook or chat.postMessage. In any case, your Slack app produced a message with buttons, offering users a chance to interact with it.
```

U06E352LU : <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-buttons>
U0HBN0L9M : hello <@U1QFMDJUX> , perhaps you can try channel <#C0J61PA31> ? what language are you familiar with?
U1QFMDJUX : thx, will check it out. I'm familiar with javascript.
U0HBN0L9M : so botkit should be a smooth ride :slightly_smiling_face:
U0HBN0L9M : I made a demo app here
U0HBN0L9M : <https://github.com/mvaragnat/botkit-messenger-express-demo>
U0HBN0L9M : should get you to helloworld quickly
U1QFMDJUX : thank you very much, I'll check it out
U1QFMDJUX : I just read that quick tutorial to get started <https://medium.com/@katyemoe/making-custom-slack-slash-commands-with-hook-io-93ba70daf681#.wzy15ihve>
