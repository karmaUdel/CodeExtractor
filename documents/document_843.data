U5U4MSHC1 : have a dictionary mapping which would pretty much do the trick
U5CRANMFV : it's complicated. the standard library won't help me?
U5S8CNULD : `data = {01: 'Jan'}`
U5U4MSHC1 : you can use `datetime` though
U5S8CNULD : our use `datetime`
U5CRANMFV : `calendar.month_abbr`
U5U4MSHC1 : yeah, i was looking at the same <@U5CRANMFV>
U5U4MSHC1 : <@U5CRANMFV> but it starts with empty item
U5CRANMFV : can't understand how to pass a number to return the month
U5CRANMFV : ```In [99]: calendar.month_abbr[3]Out[99]: 'Mar'```

U5U4MSHC1 : ```In[14]: calendar.month_abbr[int("03")]Out[14]: 'Mar'```

U582KCWUB : eh I have a stupid issue with imports, what I am trying to do: <https://www.dropbox.com/s/oajyhncno1xz5p4/Screenshot%202017-06-29%2012.17.07.png?dl=0>
what I get: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'exercises'`
the `playground` dir in the project root is a virtualenv dir, all worked fine until I added extra directory structure (the `python-mega-course-udemy` dir) any help please?

U5NMSURAQ : `.exercises`?
U582KCWUB : <@U5NMSURAQ> hmm doesnt seem to work
U61FDK1EE : import pygame
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((600,480))

done = False

font = pygame.font.SysFont("comicsansms", 72)

text = font.render("Hello, World", True, (0, 40, 0))

while not done:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            done = True
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN and event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
            done = True

    screen.fill((255, 255, 255))
    screen.blit(text,
                (320 - text.get_width() // 2, 240 - text.get_height() // 2))

    pygame.display.flip()

U61FDK1EE : I WANT ONLY THE TEXT AND NOT THE CONTAINING PYGAME WINDOW
U5LNXQHN3 : No all-capitals please... if you're hoping to just draw the text on top of your desktop background, then unfortunately that's not (practically) possible
U5LNXQHN3 : That would require that you create a transparent window, which is beyond the scope of what pygame is for
U61FDK1EE : so is there a way to add text which can be moved anywhere on screen
U5LNXQHN3 : yes, but probably not with Pygame, and implementation depends on the platform
U61FDK1EE : python 2.7
U5LNXQHN3 : no, the actual operating system platform
U61FDK1EE : ubuntu
U5LNXQHN3 : because transparent windows depend on the underlying window manager
U61FDK1EE : pygame is not necessary
U5LNXQHN3 : unfortunately I can't help you
U61FDK1EE : ?
U13L8J76J : <@U61FDK1EE> have you tried to google before asking here?
U13L8J76J : <https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/display.html#pygame.display.set_mode>
U61FDK1EE : i google  but can't find anything good
U5LNXQHN3 : Pygame is a wrapper for SDL, and SDL doesn't support this natively. There are per-platform ways to do transparent windows, but I don't know what they are, so I can't recommend anything
U5LNXQHN3 : You will probably want to find some platform-level documentation for this task, and then look for a Python library or package that encapsulates that
U13L8J76J : Oh, you _actually_ want a fully transparent window
U5VGKQ2SY : <@U582KCWUB> did you get it figured out?
U582KCWUB : <@U5VGKQ2SY> I just did, I added an init file into the wrapping dir and renamed it to have underscores not hyphens, I had no idea python would ignore hyphenated dir names
U29163YQH : dir names must follow the same rules as variables :slightly_smiling_face:
U5VGKQ2SY : nice
U1BP42MRS : Give the man a :taco:!
U5VGKQ2SY : better yet:burrito::coffee: <@U582KCWUB>

U582KCWUB : hehe, the :taco: should go to PyCharm, the hint this would be the issue was a tiny wheel in the project file explorer that appeared with the correct dir name :smile:
U1BP42MRS : Haha, woot jetbrains!
U5NMSURAQ : more like JetBros!
U4BMZ90T0 : I've got a dockerfile I'm creating for initializing a test database. I have the `.sql` and everything for it. Should I use a shell script to run the `.sql`?
U1BP42MRS : With python typehinting, what's the right way to show a generator return value?
U1BP42MRS : :facepalm: `typing.Generator`
U5NT83K1C : I'm using python. I have a column of time series in formate of ( ```pattern = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' ``` The datatype is Series and I need to convert it to string. I searched and I found out I need to use ```Data .astype(str) ``` to convert it to String. I used it but still that column is Series and not string. .astype() didn't convert. What's the solution. How may I do it?
U60KNBMPX : for example. You can find innumerable examples if you search "stringify python" on google
U1BP42MRS : Knit pick, you should probably consider `from __future__ import print_function` to be writing code that's compatible with the future of the language if you're writing python2
U0PKTUWKH : can somebody help me to understand where is the problem in the following statement```
        ec.create_tags(
            Resources=to_tag[retention_days],
              Tags=[
                {'Key': 'DeleteOn', 'Value': del_snap },
                {'Key': 'Created', 'Value': today },
            ]
        )
```

U0PKTUWKH : this is the error I am getting```
{
  "stackTrace": [
    [
      "/var/task/lambda_function.py",
      76,
      "lambda_handler",
      "{'Key': 'Created', 'Value': today },"
    ],
    [
      "/var/runtime/botocore/client.py",
      253,
```

U0PKTUWKH : i have a variable `today = datetime.date.today()`
U1BP42MRS : I would presume it needs to be a string
U5VGKQ2SY : comma after `today }`
U5VGKQ2SY : ?
U1BP42MRS : That's valid
