U14Q8S4EM : Ive never done this exactly, but I bet you could make a custom html event handle that returns `(KeyCode, String)`
U14Q8S4EM : Where the keycode is an `Int`
U14Q8S4EM : So you can get the value and the key code of what happened most recently in one go.
U0JBSEGHY : Yea there is this <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/keyboard/1.0.1/Keyboard>
U0JBSEGHY : But I still don't know where to go from here :confused:
U14Q8S4EM : Thats a little different I think.
U14Q8S4EM : So that listens to all mouse events in the whole window.
U14Q8S4EM : Thats not what you want right?
U0JBSEGHY : True
U14Q8S4EM : Hold on a second
U0JBSEGHY : ```onChange : (String -&gt; msg) -&gt; Attribute msgonChange tagger =
    on "keydown" (JD.map tagger targetValue)``` this worked in that it compiles

U0JBSEGHY : Custom Decoder instead of Custom Event Handlers.
U0JBSEGHY : I'll keep chipping away at it :slightly_smiling_face:
U14Q8S4EM : Ah okay
U14Q8S4EM : Great.
U14Q8S4EM : Well I just wrote up this bit of Elm, following on my idea
U14Q8S4EM : <https://gist.github.com/Chadtech/f296740ee724e0d69d285aaf9b082b49>
U0JBSEGHY : Don't know much about the decoders. So I will have to do a bit more reading to know what the map is doing
U0JBSEGHY : Cool thanks. I will refer to it later if I get stuck and see if it helps me along further. Thanks so much for helping
U5GJ5FEAU : i've seen a lot of examples of SPA with Elm, but how do non-SPA's use Elm? How can we have one js for Elm runtime and generate js for each page separately? instead of one huge js for the whole application
U153UK3FA : <@U5GJ5FEAU> this is something you have to do manually. A build for each page if you want the JS to be completely seperate.
U0JBSEGHY : Slowly coming together. Your gist did help <@U14Q8S4EM> I just had to change it to "keyup"
U153UK3FA : but JS tends to gzip and minify better the larger the bundles so even with a non-SPA having a single bundle might be fine
U5GJ5FEAU : <@U153UK3FA> that makes sense. though how can we manually compile the runtime and the elm application separately
U6HCJ8JHM : Hello. Quick question: What is the recommended way to Json.Encode a list of records?
U153UK3FA : <@U5GJ5FEAU> nope, you can't
U5GJ5FEAU : oh! got it.
U153UK3FA : <@U6HCJ8JHM> <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Encode#encode> has an example of encoding an object
U6HCJ8JHM : I have my single object encoder made, but figured I'd have to map over it somehow and pass it to `Json.Encode.list` or something
U0JBSEGHY : Does anyone know how to handle paste and cute in a form?
U0JBSEGHY : So far I have this ```onChange : (( Int, String ) -&gt; Msg) -&gt; Attribute MsgonChange handler =
    let
        toTuple =
            JD.map2 (,) keyCode targetValue
    in
        on "keyup" (JD.map handler toTuple)```

U6HCJ8JHM : since list takes `Value` and my single encoder returns `User`, but my `UserEncoder` returns a `Value`
U0JBSEGHY : Which handles the entering and deleting of items. Not sure how to handle a cut and paste
U153UK3FA : <@U6HCJ8JHM> you put those `Value`s in a `List` and pass it to <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Encode#list>
U153UK3FA : If you've got a `List User` you can `List.map` your encoding function to get a `List Value`
U6HCJ8JHM : ah ok. i just had to put `List` in front of map and hit save in vscode haha
U6HCJ8JHM : thanks for the help <@U153UK3FA>
U0JBSEGHY : Is there a `paste` and `cut` event?
U6B7NBTLZ : hello
