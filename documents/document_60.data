```
you extend the supertype, and call the supertype's method on method calls
it's a different class, but has the same behaviors
another alternative is to use composition (a deftype with a Foo, which re-calls every method on that Foo)
Thanks for the alternatives. I'll ponder those for a bit to see if I can make them work. Cheers!
