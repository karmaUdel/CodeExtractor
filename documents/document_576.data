Good idea, <@U1CE9DL9H>!
I need to use Dict.update to set a field in a record using an `a -&gt; Maybe a` function, how do I do this without going insane?
That is, the record is the data in the Dict
umm how do you mean?
`Dict.update` uses `(Maybe v -&gt; Maybe v)`
`Maybe.map` is convenient to avoid unwrapping/rewrapping
If you're just overwriting the old value, you can use `Dict.insert`
I've got a `Dict Int {field:List a}` and I want to set a specific position in that list using `List.Extra.setAt`, which returns a maybe, in case the index is outside the list
you might just want to use insert
but I need the other fields in that record to stay the same :confused:
insert does that
oh nvm
record
yeah
do I let..in all the way to make it readable?
