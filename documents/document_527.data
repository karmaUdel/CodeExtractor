U153UK3FA : just to be clear, there is no guarantee that your login will complete before your search request.
U153UK3FA : if they depend that ordering (implicitly passing state through the model) then they'll likely fail under different network conditions
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U6C09T8HX> Just try to be a decent person who makes the world a bit better. I don't have a rationalization for why I do this.
U6CEJALSF : hey folks! new to elm and taking the knowthen course on elm beginners concepts.  I'm a JavaScript developer by day, which is a pretty natural progression into elm, I think.(link to _free_ course: <http://courses.knowthen.com/>)

U6CEJALSF : I hope to get to know Elm a lot better over the coming months, partly for self-enrichment, partly in order to convince my team that Elm is a big step in the right direction for web UIs.
U0JBSEGHY : I've got this message. ```type Msg    = Answer String
    | MakeCall String
    | IncomingCall Maybe String```

U0JBSEGHY : My update is giving me this error ```Pattern Main.IncomingCall has too few arguments.
220|         IncomingCall caller -&gt;
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Expecting 2, but got 1.```

U153UK3FA : <@U0JBSEGHY> `IncomingCall (Maybe String)`
U0JBSEGHY : I'm calling it from a subscription. ```subscriptions model =    Sub.batch
        [ incomingCall IncomingCall ....```

U0JBSEGHY : Oh
U0JBSEGHY : ```The argument to function `incomingCall` is causing a mismatch.
276|           incomingCall IncomingCall
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^
Function `incomingCall` is expecting the argument to be:

    String -&gt; msg

But it is:

    Maybe String -&gt; Msg
```

U0JBSEGHY : I just needed to add Maybe String to my port it seems
U0JBSEGHY : slowly getting the hang of this Types thing :slightly_smiling_face:
U3F8KG1DE : I thought so too but this way feels like a workaround. I mean perhaps there is another way to acheive the same goal i.e. to animate some div element?
U3F8KG1DE : <@U0JFGGZS6> I thought so too but this way feels like a workaround. I mean perhaps there is another way to acheive the same goal i.e. to animate some div element?
U153UK3FA : <@U3F8KG1DE> it is a workaround, Elm treats the DOM as being essentially ‘write only' and doesn't provide ways to look at the state of the DOM. All attempts to look at the DOM require doing some kind of workaround.
U153UK3FA : The simplest way to do what you want is to explicitly set the height so you already know it
U3F8KG1DE : <@U153UK3FA> This is what I have actually done but this mean I will have to adjust this height every time I modify size of my div.
U153UK3FA : Yep, you will
U3F8KG1DE : I am still trying to find out a more ELM way to that. I mean CSS way is quite simple to use but not like really ELM way doing this
U153UK3FA : The fact that the DOM keeps state itself that Elm can't set or calculate is a big pain
U153UK3FA : Btw, it's just 'Elm' like the tree
U604S603Y : is there a way to get "named arguments" in function signature when using auto-complete (Visual Studio Code with Elm plugin), e.g. via a certain type of comment?
U604S603Y : for example I have `titleArea : String -&gt; Html msg`, but I want it to display additional info to explain that the `String` is the title text
U3SJEDR96 : The issue here is that the argument might not even have a name; due to point-free programming
U3SJEDR96 : for example, that could be implemented as `titleArea = Html.text`
U1SF6G7PA : you can use a record to get named arguments `titleArea : { title : String } -&gt; Html msg`
U1SF6G7PA : but i have no oppinion about whether this is a good idea :wink:
U604S603Y : mh, a record... that would make some of my long function signatures easier to handle for sure
U4872964V : Yes, a record would give you auto-complete in a competent editor/plugin. But it would be nice to get the names of the parameters too, as defined in the function definition (if not using points-free style, which I never do in function definitions because it's just confusing)
U329ZV5T8 : Anybody know how to install the elm-platform binaries on a by-project basis? I have one project using 0.17 and another using 0.18.
U4872964V : <@U329ZV5T8> there are several tools, <https://github.com/eirslett/elmvm> or <https://github.com/mattludwigs/elm-version-manager> probably more
U329ZV5T8 : Thanks. I was hoping  NPM could just handle it all, but that'll do I suppose!
U3SJEDR96 : Pretty sure you _can_ also do it with npm/yarn; though you'll have to manually pass paths to stuff like `elm-test`
U6CQ51474 : I need help! I am using ContextMenu in a div but when I right click on custom caret it select the text! any solution :slightly_smiling_face:
U4872964V : <@U6CQ51474> if you make an example in <https://ellie-app.com/> I'm sure somebody can help you
U6CQ51474 : It's a little difficult to write an example of this because there is a lot of code, it's an SVG rect where i write a text and so i use contextMenu to rightclick and display a menu on a custom caret position! So on right click it select the word between two spaces!
U4872964V : But if it doesn't happen in a small example, then it's very hard to help, because it will be specific to your code
U3SARGL7Q : hey can anyone recommend some good sample code on how to emit different message based on parsing incoming JSON in websocket?
U4872964V : <@U3SARGL7Q> not sure exactly what you want, but you can certainly decode the JSON into different union type values and handle the different cases in your update function
U3SARGL7Q : <@U4872964V> I am trying to conditionally parse JSON, I have JSON's delivered over WS such as `{"event" : "abc", params: {}}`, `{"event" : "def", params: {"someparam" :123}}`
U3SARGL7Q : I want to write JSON decoder that outputs the Msg.Abc or Msg.Def, where parameters to these messages are different depending on the message that arrived
U2M4VPZ9D : <@U3SARGL7Q> Can you maybe use andThen as in <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Decode#andThen> ?
U2M4VPZ9D : Depending on what the event string is set to, you chain it the right decoder.
U3SARGL7Q : <@U2M4VPZ9D> I already reached the point where I know that it is about andThen but I can't proceed
U3SARGL7Q : here's my code
U3SARGL7Q : ```module Subscriptions exposing 
  ( subscriptions
  )

import WebSocket
import Json.Decode as Decode

import Models exposing (Model)
import Msgs exposing (Msg)


{-| Listens on messages on the WebSocket channels to the backend.
-}
subscriptions : Model -&gt; Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
  WebSocket.listen "<ws://localhost:5000/api/player/v1.0/stream>" playerMessageHandler



{-| Handles incoming messages that can be sent by the player.
-}
playerMessageHandler : String -&gt; Msg
playerMessageHandler payload =
  case Decode.decodeString playerMessageDecoder payload of
    Err err -&gt;
      Msgs.OnPlayerUnexpectedMessage err

    Ok msg -&gt;
      msg



type alias PlayerEvent =
    { event : String
    , tracks: List }




{-| Decoder for incoming messages that can be sent by the player that is
converting JSON into message appropriate for the payload.
-}
playerMessageDecoder : Decode.Decoder Msg
playerMessageDecoder =
  Decode.field "event" Decode.string
  |&gt; Decode.andThen interpretPlayerEvent



interpretPlayerEvent : String -&gt; Decode.Decoder Msg
interpretPlayerEvent event =
  case event of 
    "snapshot" -&gt;
      Decode.succeed Msgs.OnPlayerSnapshot

    "track-position" -&gt;
      Decode.succeed Msgs.OnPlayerTrackPosition

    _ -&gt;
      Decode.fail event
```

U3SARGL7Q : but the thing is that the remaining JSON fields depend on what is in the "event" field and I struggle to find a way to do this
U2M4VPZ9D : <@U3SARGL7Q> What does your snapshot structure look like? Did you write a decoder for that?
U3SARGL7Q : there are two types of messages
U3SARGL7Q : ```{"event":"snapshot","tracks":[{"state":"playing","position":82940,"track":{"rotation_id":"whatever2","kind":"auto","id":793,"file":{"name":"32 Hope.mp3","id":"dd8f2ff7-1ee0-45c5-b8d8-5be625acccb7","duration":93037},"fade_out_at":"2017-07-24T19:25:18.767898+02:00","fade_in_at":"2017-07-24T19:23:45.730898+02:00","cue_out_at":"2017-07-24T19:25:18.767898+02:00","cue_in_at":"2017-07-24T19:23:45.730898+02:00"}}]}
```

or

```
{"event":"track-position","track":{"rotation_id":"whatever2","kind":"auto","id":793,"file":{"name":"32 Hope.mp3","id":"dd8f2ff7-1ee0-45c5-b8d8-5be625acccb7","duration":93037},"fade_out_at":"2017-07-24T19:25:18.767898+02:00","fade_in_at":"2017-07-24T19:23:45.730898+02:00","cue_out_at":"2017-07-24T19:25:18.767898+02:00","cue_in_at":"2017-07-24T19:23:45.730898+02:00"},"position":84164}
```

U3SARGL7Q : I know how to write decoder if the schema is always the same
U3SJEDR96 : `field "event" string |&gt; andThen (\eventString -&gt; case eventString of "snapshot" -&gt; snapshotDecoder [...])`
U3SJEDR96 : oh, you already have that
U3SJEDR96 : well, sort of
U3SJEDR96 : currently you're just succeeding with a message, rather than decoding the data
