Maybe not...
But certainly you could do something like multiply it by `1.0`
toFloat could certainly be `number -&gt; Float` but I’d be interested in seing your particular use case
Which may illustrate why the function doesn't exist - because in most cases it wouldn't be useful (that I can think of anyway)
My mistake!  I guess you *can't* multiply by 1.0 :slightly_smiling_face:
But I guess the thing is if you have a `number` you can just use it as a `Float` rather than converting it to a `Float`
(i.e. it basically is a Float already - for practical purposes)
