U0JBSEGHY : I also want to track a backspace to send another message out to the AsYouType formmater to pop off the last number
U14Q8S4EM : <@U0JBSEGHY>, so are you using a port to send it out to that libphonenumber-google service?
U14Q8S4EM : Regarding the backspace, you can add your own custom event listener that listens for that key code.
U0JBSEGHY : Yea I have it on the client side. So I am just working with it as some external JS client side
U0JBSEGHY : I just realised I probably also have to track deletes and cut and pastes as well :confused: haha.
U14Q8S4EM : Yeah thats all no problem if you just make an even listener that takes an `Int -&gt; Msg`
U14Q8S4EM : Do you need any help making that kind of thing? And regarding the google service, why dont you use a port to send back whatever it is you wanted in Elm?
U0JBSEGHY : I think I might have to sit down and map it all out. I also want to accept letters and treat it as a search bar as well.
U0JBSEGHY : I have a port sending it back and showing the result elsewhere but I would like to also format the input field.
U0JBSEGHY : This is a little more fancy than I initially thought it would be haha
U14Q8S4EM : I think Ive been in your circumstance. I had an app that I wanted to listen for the enter key. There are a few ways to do it, but I ended up with..```
input
    [ onChange HandleField
    , onEnter HandleEnter
    , value model.inputField
    ]
    []

onEnter : Msg -&gt; Attribute Msg
```

U14Q8S4EM : It fired that message if the key that was pressed was the enter, and then separately, there was another event listener that listened for the changes generally
U14Q8S4EM : When you say "format the input field", you might like change or update?
U0JBSEGHY : I think I should hold 3 different states in the model. The current state of input, the state of the formatted number (human) and then the state of the number for international calling format.
U0JBSEGHY : I'm going to have a crack at what you have just outlined there. I just reread the code and it makes sense now haha
U0JBSEGHY : <@U14Q8S4EM> how does your HandleField work? Does it accept a string?
U0JBSEGHY : ```The 1st and 2nd entries in this list are different types of values.
327|                         [ onInput FormatNumber
328|&gt;                        , onChange HandleField
329|                         , value model.numberToCall
330|                         , placeholder "Enter a Phone Number"
331|                         , class "login-form"
332|                         ]

The 1st entry has this type:

    Attribute (Msg)

But the 2nd is:

    Attribute (String -&gt; Msg)```

U0JBSEGHY : If I remove the first input field it throws errors all the way down the view. So I'm a little stuck on the types.
U14Q8S4EM : Yeah, accepting a string is what I had in mind.
U14Q8S4EM : So.. `type Msg = HandleField String | ...`

U3HQVHERX : it says "emitted bundle.js" but i do not see it anywhere
U14Q8S4EM : Although I would name it something other than `HandleField`, maybe something more specific to what you are doing
U0JBSEGHY : Yea I am just trying to get it to compile for me first
U0JBSEGHY : The thing is having `HandleField String` throws errors on all my `onClick` handlers
U0JBSEGHY : That is once I remove the `onInput`
