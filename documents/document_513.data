<@U0LPMPL2U> thanks, I guess I will simply define an Ignore message and use it for all kinds of Task/Cmd whose result I don’t care, like ``` Task.attempt (always Ignore) (Dom.focus elementId) ```
This is the part where the user click the update button (all routing logic has been done') and sending the Cmd to the api end. But since this model allow it to update the primary key also. I will have to find a way to get the primary key from the route instead of form model here.
Can you extract the id when you're doing the routing logic and set it on the model or pass it into whatever function is building the Cmd?
