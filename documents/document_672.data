U0CLDU8UB : You only need the one, for development. You will need another later (a modified version) if you're going to deploy the app somewhere.
U601ELFEG : I don't think so - you need `(a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; Array a -&gt; Array b -&gt; Array c` , doing pairwise application, yielding an array the length of the smaller. You could `fold` over `Array a`, but when accessing `Array b` with `Array.get` you get a `Maybe b` , and even if you've limited `i` so you know it fits, you need to some icky stuff to "escape the `Maybe`".
U601ELFEG : This is why it is nice to have such a thing in the library!
U601ELFEG : thanks
U619DD78U : <@U0CLDU8UB> Two reasons that would make me want to break things up are if (a) the javascript file that elm generates is large or (b) the upgrade policy is loose.  For example, in the angular world since the size of the generated was so large, it behooved teams to split up the code into modules for faster loading.  And because the upgrade from 1 - 2 was originally so painful, it again made more sense to split up large apps into a series of smaller apps.
U0CLDU8UB : Take a look at your dev tools' network panel when you load up <http://yksille.fi|yksille.fi>
U0CLDU8UB : It's 10kloc Elm application plus some JS in the main JavaScript file
U0CLDU8UB : Likely in 0.19 different pages of the application can be split into their own JS files, too
U0F5SH6UQ : I did some stuff last year, but very little. Mostly it was just interfacing with Tone.js over ports
U601ELFEG : I want to code MIDI device access - so I can get SysEx. from a device
U5FU80S06 : <@U0CLDU8UB>  I cannot get it to work, probably because I'm doing something wrong. This is what I have: ```    &lt;body&gt;        &lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;script src="/_compile/src/Main.elm"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
            Elm.Main.embed(document.getElementById('app'),
                {randomInt: Math.floor(Math.random()*0x0FFFFFFF)});

            // ...

        &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
``` And I also tried record-free to no avail: ```Elm.Main.embed(document.getElementById('app'),
                Math.floor(Math.random()*0x0FFFFFFF));```

U0CLDU8UB : Is your Elm code in src/Main.elm?
U0JFXEUCT : I haven’t touched MIDI yet, but would be very interested if you find any existing work
U5FU80S06 : yes, it starts there, and the rest of the elm code is all under _src_.
U5FU80S06 : Not to worry, it's not a biggie. I can always do a Debug.log...
U2LAL86AY : what's the error message?
U2GPAEU1L : Hey everyone, I was thinking _next remote meetup_, we could do a meetup targeted at people new to  Elm and managers who aren't sure that they want to use Elm.
*How many people have managers that they have been trying to convince to switch to Elm (even just for a small project/feature)?*

If there are enough people who would appreciate if we tried to convince their managers, then I think it would be well worth it for one meetup.

Please comment in the thread so we have all the comments in one place for reference.

I will post this in the general channel as well.

U5FU80S06 : <@U2LAL86AY> ```Oops! Something went wrong when starting your Elm program.
Trying to initialize the `Main` module with an unexpected flag.
I tried to convert it to an Elm value, but ran into this problem:

Expecting an Int but instead got: undefined``` I click on _Main.elm_ from _File Navigation_.

U2GPAEU1L : <@U5FFVDC4W> can I see your flags defined in Elm?
U5FU80S06 : ```main =  Html.programWithFlags 
    { init = init
    , view = view
    , update = update
    , subscriptions = subscriptions
    }``` and ```init : Int -&gt; ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init jsSeed = ...```

U2GPAEU1L : Ah I see this is a reactor issue, nvm, I came in late :sweat:
U5FU80S06 : Note that I am doing `elm-make Main.elm --output elm.js`
U0CLDU8UB : Oh, you should run `elm-reactor` and then go to <http://localhost:8000/index.html>
U5FU80S06 : <@U0CLDU8UB>  That gives me a totally blank page
U0CL0AS3V : we use it at NRI via ports
U5FU80S06 : Actually I can run my original index.html (no taco) via reactor and app comes up fine (at <http://localhost:8000/index.html>) -- I just don't see the state of the model anywhere.
U3SJEDR96 : do you see a little "history" thing in the bottom right?
