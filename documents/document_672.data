how to continue to add data, I do not understand.
`append` to the list...for sure...now try
So there can be multiple `{'10.01.2005': {'issue': ['important1', 'important2'], 'url': ['url1', '<http://google.com>']}}` ?
all. tired better not to sit at the computer. go to the beach.
so if important3 and url3 came in, there are different "10.01.2005" that it can go into?
append, it list.
everything is very easy.))
I don't think you can use a dictionary for this. Hopefully someone else can confirm, but I think you're looking at using a list instead.
z[date]['issue'] is probably a list
Exactly :)
In PyCharm, can you have the project run kick off a bunch of things at once? For example, I want to run Django, Celery Workers, and Celery Beat
If you find out that share it with me. I have to open like 5 command windows to get started
`subprocess.open` at the start of the script ? :smile:
