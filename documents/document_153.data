<@U0LL6RZPS>: if it works then thank *you* otherwise `bot.api.postMessage` :)
<@U0KJ5A91V>: ^^  I'll try to go direct then. I dug into the Botkit code and it does send this object into bot.api.postMessage so I thought .reply would work similarly. I'm sure I'm making a small mistake somewhere. If I just have the <http://api.slack.com> by itself it makes a link. Thanks for your help. I'll probably just put this issue the shelf for now!
<@U0LL6RZPS>: I have tried `.reply` before but without the `unfurl_link` option, that didnt work
both let you do that
Hey guys, does the identify scope give current user read? If not is the only way to get a current user read to have a full all team user read? I'd like to just identify and read the current authenticating user.
<@U0HKDKHD4> yep at the moment requesting the full team's info is the best you can do if you want the current authenticating user's
doesn't auth.test give that info?
Is there an event generated if a person reads/scrolls/sees an individual message?
specifically on a dm
Also: What's a best practice for making a Botkit conversation wait until 1) a user clicks a link to a site, and 2) logs in, before continuing the conversation?
<@U0LL6RZPS>: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/general/p1455423948001318>
no
thanks ernesto
np
:simple_smile:
regarding to your second question, you will have to implement the checks o the website to track the link was visited and the user signed in
off to sleep now, it's 5am here xD
morning all

Two questions: 1) Anyone have any NLP libraries they like? and 2) Are there any frameworks or best practices to abstract the conversation logic from the bot logic if I want to make a bot for multiple networks?
There's a <http://wit.ai|wit.ai> integration with botkit + an experimental middleware in the works 
Will try to find links 
thanks <@U0HBN0L9M> !
Hi everybody, I have a doubt. I need to make api request to google maps inside the conversation. How can i do that?
