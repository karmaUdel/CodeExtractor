U37HUSJ4R : cheers everyone :smile:
U1EEBCQM6 : Hi guys &amp; gals
U1EEBCQM6 : lol
U1EEBCQM6 : So slackbot needs to get smarter
U1EEBCQM6 : hahaha
U1EEBCQM6 : question... Is it possible to decode a deeply nested array into a flat `List` and not a nested type?
U0LPMPL2U : yes
U23SA861Y : need to be a bit more specific but probably yes
U0LPMPL2U : the shape of the JSON does not need to be replicated in your Elm types
U1EEBCQM6 : ```json : String
json =
    """
    {
        "name": "Product",
        "attributes": {
            "format": {
                "id": "format",
                "name": "Format",
                "options": [
                    {
                        "id": "a4",
                        "name": A4"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "a3",
                        "name": A3"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "printing": {
                "id": "printing",
                "name": "Printing",
                "options": [
                    {
                        "id": "4/4",
                        "name": 4/4"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "4/0",
                        "name": 4/0"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    """
```
A flat list of the options in this case

U1EEBCQM6 : I'd like to create a type:```
type alias Option =
    { id : String
    , name : String
    , attribute : String
    }

U1EEBCQM6 : ```type alias Option =
    { id : String
    , name : String
    , attribute : String
    }
```

U23SA861Y : I think you need to bounce through a dictionary for this one and then issue the map
U1EEBCQM6 : mmm.. I was afraid of that. So I'd have to create the nested `Dict` and from that create the `List`.
U0LPMPL2U : what does that `attribute` string map to?
U23SA861Y : presumably the key like `printing`
U0LPMPL2U : ah, so there would be multiple options where the `attribute` is `printing`
U23SA861Y : <@U1EEBCQM6>  ^
U0LPMPL2U : If I understand correctly, you want the formatting and printing options together in a flattened list?
U1EEBCQM6 : Yes.. correct
U0LPMPL2U : OK, that should be possible without a `Dict`


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
	If Yes:
	1.Bad	2.Very bad
	If No:
	1.Good	2.Very good


How confident are you?
	1.Low
	2.Average
	3.High

Optional!
can you highlight place/word/sentence which lead to your decision
