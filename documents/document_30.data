Hello everyone, is there any book/online resource about functional architectural patterns? Something like Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture by Martin Fowler but from a functional point of view...
Rich Hickey's Talks can be considered as source of some patterns I think
<@U052TDWT7>  <http://mishadoff.com/blog/clojure-design-patterns/>
Thanks <@U297WCSHK>, <@U5YHX0TQV>
any spectacular clojure alternative to <https://github.com/Raynes/conch>?
clojure's built-in `sh` is limited (no support for processing stdout/stderr as streams)
What's going on here?
<@U1C72J3J4> I pasted exactly what you have into the repl and got `2`.
<@U1C72J3J4> Looks like that error message indicates a problem with the regex
Just to double check, what version of core.match are you using?
<@U07S8JGF7> `[org.clojure/core.match "0.3.0-alpha4"]`, with `(:require  [clojure.core.match :as m][clojure.core.match.regex])` in my ns
<@U1CD720KB> `(re-matches #"stuff.*" "stuff123")` works, so no regex issues as well
clojure version: `org.clojure/clojure "1.9.0-alpha15`
I'm not sure what the design of this is, but it looks like it might be a boog.
