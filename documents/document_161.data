<@U0HKDKHD4> I see your install doc says ```npm install --save botkit-middleware-witai``` I assume that should be `-<http://api.ai|api.ai>`
<@U13DWUG8Y>: looks like is quite close to what I need but what i am having a hard time is to recognise time expressions from a sentence,
<@U0563E81H> - best news ever, thanks!
<@U0563E81H> - actually a followup question - is that available for REST api?
ah yes, I'll make a change, used the template from the <http://wit.ai|wit.ai> middleware for consistency
quick question : anyone have already stress test a node.js application that listen to slack for message ? what is your tricks ?
<@U0JPS3SHX>: There's also <https://github.com/wanasit/chrono>, based on the excellent chronic Ruby lib
I've just started using <http://date.js.org/> and it feels pretty good so far
date.js looks great
do you know how timezones are handled? <@U0HPNTZ8Q>
No, not really, I'm not there yet. But I think the general idea is that you have to pass in offsets relative to the local timezone
<@U0HPNTZ8Q>: great - I'll add that later but thanks for the tip on Date.js, it saved me an evening of implementing Wit
works like a charm
<@U0HPNTZ8Q>: if a non-time-related text is entered, the output is now. How do you detect if that's the case ?
I'm sorry, I have no idea. In my usecase I know the user is going to enter a date now. And I'm going to show the resulting date/time back to the user to have him verify it's correct.
But that doesn't sound cool and I can't think of an easy way handle that off the top of my head :confused:
hey <@U1DDKQPGB> just saw your tweet re human ‘bots', would love to talk when you have time :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks <@U0CNYC404> :slightly_smiling_face: should I explain here or email? [waiting for the slack cops to knock on my door]
DM me :slightly_smiling_face:
Dear All, We would like to implement xoxco which allows us to use our wikipedia with slack.  <https://blog.howdy.ai/our-slack-wiki-e4f6d23a3495#.sftexn5ba>
could you somebody help us to install this?
Hey <@U04SM6T2H> - love the Slack Wiki thing - would be an awesome integration with TiddlyWiki - is the code on Github?
Hey there, did anyone had any disconnected RTM around 4am UTC?
julian_e: yep
it happens from time to time
<@U0JAVM98A>: ok thanks, just wanted to check since Slack status doesn't report any incident :slightly_smiling_face:
julian_e: not an incident, it just happens, you reconnect and voila
It happened for &gt; 90% of our teams and the Web API was slow for several hours too
exact
I wouldn't care if it was just some RTM disconnected here or there (this indeed happens all the time). But tonight was a bigger issue for us :slightly_smiling_face:
yes, it was bigger than usual
<@U1292LZFC>: <@U1D0EBWVC> the code is like 15 lines of php
well maybe like 150 lines
its just a wrapper on grep and reading and writing markdown files
<@U04SM6T2H>: you gonna make me dig out my PHP?! :wink: Cool - thanks, I'll give it a go
haha
i would say just build your own
i mean, really this was a hack day project
