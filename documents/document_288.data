U5QPUBDQR : ({ model | captions = List.map updateVideo model.captions, debug = b },
U5QPUBDQR : ie update the model, from the model?
U3SJEDR96 : I'm not sure what you mean by that. `update` returns a _new_ model, and _usually_ that's based on your previous state
U3SJEDR96 : so using your previous model to build a new one makes perfect sense
U5QPUBDQR : <@U3SJEDR96> a yes: immutabilty takes some getting used to
U3SJEDR96 : yeah, it's important to realize that `{ foo | v = "val" }` creates a _new_ record )
U5QPUBDQR : <@U3SJEDR96> thanks. I'm very happy with this slack channel, good help available :slightly_smiling_face:
U57KYFW67 : It's not possible to include two .js files created by Elm on one page, is it?
U50SABLHE : How would I Json.Encode an array of objects to be used in a request body? Below is an example of what I need to send.
```
[
    {
        "request-id": 1,
        "action-name": "checkZipCode",
        "zip-code": "41501"
    }
]
```

I'm using the following code to Encode the object, but I'm not sure how to add the surrounding array brackets
```
encodeZipCode : Encode.Value
encodeZipCode =
    Encode.object
        [ ( "request-id", <http://Encode.int|Encode.int> 1 )
        , ( "action-name", Encode.string "checkZipCode" )
        , ( "zip-code", Encode.string "41501" )
        ]
```

U3SJEDR96 : ```encodeZipCode : Encode.Value
encodeZipCode =
    Json.Encode.list 
        [ Encode.object
            [ ( "request-id", <http://Encode.int|Encode.int> 1 )
            , ( "action-name", Encode.string "checkZipCode" )
            , ( "zip-code", Encode.string "41501" )
            ]
        ]
```

U3SJEDR96 : that should work. Alternatively, this should also work: ```
encodeZipCode : Encode.Value
encodeZipCode =
    Encode.object
        [ ( "request-id", <http://Encode.int|Encode.int> 1 )
        , ( "action-name", Encode.string "checkZipCode" )
        , ( "zip-code", Encode.string "41501" )
        ]
        |&gt; List.singleton
        |&gt; Json.Encode.list
```

U3SJEDR96 : so basically, wrap it in a list, and encode that with `Json.Encode.list`
U50SABLHE : <@U3SJEDR96> Thanks, that was exactly what I needed.
U59AF21LJ : <@U3SJEDR96> Sorry for the late reply. I actually see that as a problem, because sometimes it doesn't refresh with the value the model provides and just keeps the one the user wrote instead.
U5WD40ZA9 : Anyone know any recent examples of someone creating a dropdown so that when you click outside of it, it closes? Would be really helpful, thanks in advance :slightly_smiling_face:!
U4PT7NG4V : I've always just put an invisible overlay over the background behind popups and handled the click there and dismiss the popup. But maybe I'm old school and there's a better way
U0K92QFST : <@U5WD40ZA9> there was *just* a discussion about exactly this in <#C13L7S5GR|elm-dev>!
U0K92QFST : <https://ellie-app.com/3tm2WSV9JTza1/0>
U0K92QFST : credit where due: <https://elmlang.slack.com/archives/C13L7S5GR/p1498165749675291>
U5WD40ZA9 : <@U0K92QFST> I'll take a look! Thank you very much :+1:
U4PT7NG4V : That's really neat :slightly_smiling_face:
U2W8J47KQ : I'm curious how that's listening for the "outside" clicks, it's not super obvious to me
U2W8J47KQ : oh it's looking for focus change events, neat
U4PT7NG4V : Kinda neat code wise, makes it difficult to inspect the popup in dev tools though
U2W8J47KQ : I always have that problem with styling popups/dropdown/etc, chrome hover/focus toggle helps some
U3SJEDR96 : <@U59AF21LJ> that's a problem if the part of your model that should match the input field is modified in any way _other_ than through the input field. One reason to do it the way it's done in the guide, is to prevent the cursor from jumping if you type faster than your (`update` loop can process + a render can be queued through requestanimationframe, and your updated model is finally rendered), which takes about ~16ms at most. Especially noticeable if your cursor isn't at the end of the input :wink:
U3LUC6SNS : Is there a way of putting user-defined modules in Ellie?
U23SA861Y : publishing them first?
U3LUC6SNS : I would say that mathematics is more about manipulating structures, of which the integers, the real numbers, etc., are particular examples.
U3LUC6SNS : I suppose so, but the modules I have in mind are of little value outside of the example.  Seems like littering :slightly_smiling_face:
U23SA861Y : well it looks like it can install things which the elm package manager can find
U23SA861Y : well it's either big enough to be a package (which you maybe can publish) or its small enough to inline into a single page
U3LUC6SNS : Where is `Msg` defined?
U3LUC6SNS : <@U23SA861Y> can I inline a module, that is, include its text in the "Main.elm" file?
U23SA861Y : Msg is defined wherever you defined it...
U23SA861Y : its just code, the import prefixes might need to be rewritten but there is nothing that stops you from moving that code around. (with the exception of circular imports)
U3LUC6SNS : Got it! :slightly_smiling_face:
U23SA861Y : The only think that actually needs to be a seperate modules is ports I believe
U236M9FH9 : ports don't have to be in a separate module, but it's best as every port has the same namespace so a single module can help prevent name collisions.
U23SA861Y : umm I thought you needed a special `port module` declaration
U236M9FH9 : You do, but you can have multiple modules with that declaration
U236M9FH9 : And other elm code can live in that module
U23SA861Y : It can but I don't think that module can be toplevel
U23SA861Y : I don't think your main module can be a port module
U23SA861Y : huh, nvm that works in ellie
U23SA861Y : stand corrected
U3LUC6SNS : I posted the following in the `style-elements` channel, but it concerns a general Elm bug, so I am posting it here as well:
I made a small project that demonstrates the textarea bug.  See the README for details.  To run the project, do `git clone <https://github.com/jxxcarlson/nanoedit>`, bring up `elm-reactor`, and select `Main.elm`.  I'm very interested in finding a solution or workaround for this. :slightly_smiling_face:

U5Y4ERBU0 : hello! I'm trying to use a guard with the code below, but the compiler tells me it can't find the "|=" or "=&gt;" variables. Anyone know why?
```getValidationMessage : Model -&gt; String
getValidationMessage { password, passwordAgain } 
  = password /= passwordAgain =&gt; "Passwords don't match."
  |= "OK"```

U2FGMAQ5R : Does anybody know how I can use a Set with a custom type? I'd like a collection that only contains unique entries but Set only works with primitives
U0LPMPL2U : <@U5Y4ERBU0> it sounds like you're trying to write Haskell. Elm doesn't have "guards". :slightly_smiling_face:
U0LPMPL2U : You can write this as an if/else statement or a case statement
U5Y4ERBU0 : i tried to emulate this <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Fresheyeball/elm-guards/1.0.1/Guards>
U5Y4ERBU0 : do I need to import something?
U0LPMPL2U : Are you trying to use that package?
U5Y4ERBU0 : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Fresheyeball/elm-guards/latest>
U5Y4ERBU0 : i guess so
U0LPMPL2U : if so, you will need to install the package: `elm package install Fresheyeball/elm-guards` on the command line
