U43E2J0FM : brilliant, would you be willing to share the code?
U3Y2UBA1E : Hey guys....sujan is here...i want to know that how to format my response message which display like there is multiple attachment which is showing same message ...
U3Y2UBA1E : Actually i am going to add message json data into array and then i send json response in slack when slash command fire
U0GT29N3A : <@U3Y2UBA1E> You can put markdown in attachments (the example you show has bold) by using `{"mrkdwn_in":["text"]}` : <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting>
U3Y2UBA1E : Ohky....thank you...actually i have  already done. But thanks again :slightly_smiling_face: :+1: 
U0KECURAT : sujanpatel: sounds like a  job for <http://www.walkiebot.co|www.walkiebot.co> ! :slightly_smiling_face:
U419E6R60 : I'm reading the Oauth documentation (<https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth>) and in the hook back to my API, I would like the profile details of the user who authenticated.  In making the request `<https://slack.com/oauth/authorize>?....` is there anyway that I can request slack to send the profile details of the authenticating user when it makes a request to my redirect hook?
U272P5K71 : <@U419E6R60>: unfortunately, you have to make an additional user info call after you get the token.
U419E6R60 : Yeah in authing when I pass `identity.*` and any other scopes I get an error message
U419E6R60 : ```Invalid permissions requested
Cannot request both identity scopes and other scopes at the same time

```

U419E6R60 : I notice this error message when I add `identity.*` scopes and other scopes when requesting a page for the user to auth:```
Invalid permissions requested
Cannot request both identity scopes and other scopes at the same time
```

U419E6R60 : this is after makign this request `<https://slack.com/oauth/authorize>?`
U419E6R60 : why can I  not request both identity scopes and other scopes?
U07CW6N3A : Unfortunately, at this time you need to perform the round trip twice -- the identity scopes are _exclusive_ in that they can only be requested on their own without other scopes. But if you go ahead in a second trip to oauth/authorize requesting the other scopes you want, they'll be added on to the existing token progressively
U419E6R60 : I've been trying to find a reason but I cannot find it
U07CW6N3A : The reason why is that Sign in with Slack is a kind of product of its own that just happens to run on the same OAuth used to install apps. That installing an app and Signing in to one are two distinct activities. It can be confusing.
U419E6R60 : i see...ok thank you <@U07CW6N3A>
U07CW6N3A : It trips enough folks up that I think it's likely you'll find that seemingly artificial separation bridged one day.
U419E6R60 : Yeah I was intuitively putting that understanding together seeing as that there is a `sign in` with slack button and `an add to slack ` button
U419E6R60 : suggesting two different APIs...
U419E6R60 : Thank you for the clarification
U07CW6N3A : It's far too subtle. Your intention is clear when you combine them.
U4E978VP1 : Thanks for the invite <@U04SM6T2H>

U4DRMESFM : hi, does anyone here have any problems with the timestamp not being precise? I'm new to programming and trying to implement an automod, but when it goes to delete messages, it returns `message_not_found`, but the timestamps are exactly the same when printed out :slightly_frowning_face:

U4F138LQP : Hello all. My name is Mathias "allgray", and i mod/own a few Slack teams for different purposes. I have a hubot setup and deployed locally, but i have a heck of a trouble getting it to create DM's to my users. Anyone have any knowledge on this matter?
U1LQ4MEKE : allgray: Depending on what errors you're getting and what tools you're using you might checkout these channels : <#C0J3B9M26|platform-hubot> <#C1HK27SVD|sdk-hubot-slack> or <#C0K8617D5|slack-api>
It's helpful to add in any context of what issue(s) you're running into and what you've already tried in order to solve the problem.

U4F138LQP : Thank you shannon. I'll check out those channels and i'll be a little more specific next time.
U1LQ4MEKE : No worries! Just wanna help you find the help you need if I can :smile:
U4EJ8GHTP : hi, any idea if slack has phone API? is there a way to tap into phone conversation through slack phone api?
U0V93GE5R : from what Ive read “not yet"
U4EJ8GHTP : <@U0V93GE5R> thanks for your quick reply.. i wonder if its on slacks product roadmap?
U0V93GE5R : havent heard anything about it, but nothing is on the trello
U4EJ8GHTP : thanks <@U0V93GE5R> .. is the slack phone uses screen hero?

U0HUTFBHS : `Between 08:38am PST and 08:47am PST Slack was serving errors for all requests to <http://slack.com|slack.com>. This was caused by a code change that has now been reverted.

U4F2U6PRB : Hello :the_horns:
U4FLKQ64X : Hi. I want to create a slash command that creates a zendesk ticket e.g.:/help [description]
Where should I post? Thanks. 

U1DM2B4SY : Zendesk has a slack integration: <https://www.zendesk.com/apps/slack/> would that not fulfill your needs?
U1DM2B4SY : We don't use zendesk, so the answer may very well be 'No'
U4AUA2YAY : My team would like to do something similiar for Service Now
U0XRM115M : that's just zendesk notifications to a chosen channel
U0XRM115M : you don't really need that app to accomplish that goal
U0XRM115M : but that's all they offer
U0XRM115M : I've tooled around with using a /command to generate a zendesk ticket
U0XRM115M : and I don't think that's the best method
U0XRM115M : you tend to need much more information than you'll want to put after that /command
U0XRM115M : I use a botkit to have a conversation to collect the necessary information
U4FLKQ64X : This page from Slack implies that it's possible:<https://slackhq.com/simplify-your-workflows-7d3f7736a796#.sld2g8jhz>

U07CW6N3A : <@U4FLKQ64X> If you write &amp; host a service/app that integrates with the ServiceNow API and then build a slack command that triggers the service you've written to create a ticket there, you can definitely make something like that happen.
U0XRM115M : I wasn't saying that it is impossible; just that a slash command didn't fit the input I expected for creating a ticket
U0XRM115M : obviously tailor to your use case, but /commands are practical in our environment for getting all the information needed for a useful ticket
U4FLKQ64X : <@U07CW6N3A> <@U0XRM115M> Some guidance on where to start would be great. I'm new to Slack dev so please excuse the simple questions. 
U3XUJM0E6 : The code for my bot crashes but only under load. What's a good tool to simulate load for a slack bot
U07CW6N3A : <@U4FLKQ64X> this still speaks more to the world of custom integrations than Slack apps, but the knowledge is easily portable: <https://api.slack.com/tutorials/your-first-slash-command>  -- The example loads data from wikipedia.   In your version of something similar, you'd be collecting input from the slash command like: `/ticket This is the problem I want to file` and once the invocation reaches your server, instead of talking to wikipedia you'd prepare some kind of POST/write request to the ServiceNow API.
U0T1G849W : We've been working with BotKit on an integration that makes it easy to build a hybrid human + AI experience.   Just sharing some of that effort here:   <https://chatbotsmagazine.com/keep-humans-in-the-loop-with-botkit-wordhop-bd295bec5cf9>
U1TAT1DMY : Is there a way to use markdown in slack confirm dialogs?
U0LLUCLP3 : <@U0T1G849W> This is great news! I had a similar idea for Amazon Alexa Re: hybrid human + AI experience. You're at the forefront-ier of great possibilities! See:<https://twitter.com/jay_bee12345/status/818181239848845312>

U0T1G849W : Thanks <@U0LLUCLP3> - Appreciate the feedback!   Amazon just announced yesterday plans to bring Alexa to call centres as part of a solution to bring  archaic call centres to AWS, along with other value and learnings from Amazon's own help desk.
U0LLUCLP3 : Thanks for the update! Exciting time to be alive for sure. Wordhop's making bots more effective and Amazon's making customer service cheaper! PS-Thanks Amir.
U04SM6T2H : Anyone here coming to Austin for SXSW?

U2VMTE1FD : hey, potentially a noob slackbot question...Ive created slack bots plenty of times, always goes smoothly. essentially follow this:<https://api.slack.com/bot-users>
but then I want to create an add to slack button for this bot. I think that means I need to create a slack app, did all that, but how do I tie it back to my original bot? i continually get errors when trying to do this, and the docs feel circular without a solution

U04SM6T2H : <@U2VMTE1FD> the custom integration bot user is totally different from the slack app bot user
U04SM6T2H : you can't migrate
U04SM6T2H : I mean, you _can_ fro ma botkit perspective
U04SM6T2H : but the _bot user_ itself is separate, you would recreate a new bot post-login
U2VMTE1FD : so i go create my slack app. install it to my team, and i get a new oAuth token
U2VMTE1FD : basically what do i put in my .env for slackbot-token if i want to go the full app route?
U2VMTE1FD : custom integration bot user is pretty straight forward, im happy to start over for the custom app, juts need to know what to do and slacks docs aren't super easy to follow on this
U04SM6T2H : you get the bot token from the oauth process
U04SM6T2H : and Botkit stores it internally
U04SM6T2H : so instead you pass in the clientId and clientSecret
U04SM6T2H : <@U2VMTE1FD> i would look at the slack starter kit project
U04SM6T2H : it is all set up to do the custom app route
U2VMTE1FD : ok cool will look there
U04SM6T2H : <@U2VMTE1FD> <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack>
U0V93GE5R : <http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/9/14864552/google-hangouts-chat-update-announced-slack-group-messaging-video> more bots!

U4GAB7PEW : I'm trying to attach a snippet using incoming-webhooks. <https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks> Is that possible?
U4G8FAVPW : Hey. I'm following the Slack bot tutorial here: <https://slackapi.github.io/node-slack-sdk/bots#initializing-a-bot> but when trying to post my first message in the Posting a Message section I'm getting the error "Unhandled rejection Error    at RTMClient.handleMessageAck [as _handleMessageAck]”

U4GFSK2Q4 : Hello guys, i can't find the page where i can change icon for my app/bot user. Bot is already installed and used by me and my team.
U0KECURAT : <@U4GFSK2Q4> <https://api.slack.com/apps> &lt;- here
U0KECURAT : just click on the name
U4GFSK2Q4 : I clicked on every page in the sidebar
U0KECURAT : huh, true. Don't know where that went
U4GFSK2Q4 : Me neither, confused as hell.  Where can i get some additional support?
U0KECURAT : try here <https://api.slack.com/support> - this is not an official slack support channel :slightly_smiling_face:
U4GFSK2Q4 : Thanks
U4GHMK76Y : Hi. I'm new with botkit and I'm looking how to use my bot in telegram, somebody knows where I can find information?
U0LLUCLP3 : Observation: With <https://api.slack.com/faq> and Wordhop someone could make a very intuitive API FAQ Slack Bot.
U0LLUCLP3 : API FAQ Slack Bots could be made for each API featuring platform ideally as Slack is a great developers tool... Sorry for the spam. Enjoy a great a Friday!The benefit of this vs just going to the API webpage and posting the link is that with the Slack Bot you can periodically post API update news &amp; with Wordhop you can have a live agent in your Slack for a team discussion.

U1RL6RTCY : URGENT !!! can I use botkit for commercial purposes ?

U4FSTGTU0 : How to get invite code for botkit studio quickly ?U0V93GE5R

U0V93GE5R : there ya go! :point_up::skin-tone-2:
U21U8SZ2P : do any Slack APIs send an event when a user's time zone changes? Can't think of another solution to be more proactive about reacting to clock changes
U21U8SZ2P : oh I'm seeing `user_change` in the events API
U04SM6T2H : I don't think they send those when the automatic change happens <@U21U8SZ2P> 
U04SM6T2H : We poll the user settings 
U21U8SZ2P : <@U04SM6T2H> That's what I do too, but it doesn't happen until the bot makes its usual contact, so that first contact post-time change is still an hour off
U04SM6T2H : we have a cron job that runs
U04SM6T2H : and polls all users
U04SM6T2H : once a day!
U04SM6T2H : because dst happens all over the place at different times and it is horrible
U21U8SZ2P : it's so horrible i hate it as a concept

U4GQR1QM7 : Hi, I have problems with "interactive messages" .  When I press one button I get the message: ```Oh no, something went wrong. Please try that again.```. I've setup a Request URL in my Interactive buttons panel in my app.  Do I need to use another token? My app does not do the OAuth 2.0's authorization code grant flow  but I use the credentials on the 'basic information' tab.
U4GQR1QM7 : I'm doing it in Python. If there is some example code. that would be super
U0E9LFL3F : Hi. I'm developing a bot that gives access to some admin-level backend systems. Once I've installed the bot in slack, everyone can use it right? There's no way to add some authorization / privileges system to the bot, I've to code it internally, right? Thanks!
U0KECURAT : <@U0E9LFL3F> correct
U0E9LFL3F : fine. better to know before starting a big development iteration for nothing :slightly_smiling_face:
U0HUTFBHS : <@U0E9LFL3F> Some bot frameworks, like Lita, have auth functionality built-in.
U4GQR1QM7 : somebody knows why interactive buttons deliver _Oh no, something went wrong. Please try that again._ ??
U2VMTE1FD : is there a consensus on slack bots in a channel? this is for bots that can do multiple turns of conversation, not just questoin/response. do you want1. one conversation per team?
Mitch: "@watson when does the build go out?"
Watson: "which build number do you want?"
(I leave for a beer)
Dave: "@watson build 1234"
Watson: the build goes out tomorrow"
but obviously this can easily get confused if multiple people send different messages, or
2. one conversation per channelMember?
this allows multiple people to ask different questions and get respective answers, but cant really collaborate on a single conversation, basically like a public dm

U4GQR1QM7 : <@U2VMTE1FD> is this answer for me?
U07CW6N3A : <@U4GQR1QM7> when you're sending the message containing a button, are you doing so from your app, the same one that has a registered action URL with it? (or are you posting the message possibly via a custom integration webhook or bot user?) the messages must be posted by the same app that acts as receiver for actions  ---  if you are posting messages from the app, are you receiving _any_ kind of requests to your action URL (even ones that might be erroring or timing out somehow?)


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
	If Yes:
	1.Bad	2.Very bad
	If No:
	1.Good	2.Very good


How confident are you?
	1.Low
	2.Average
	3.High

Optional!
can you highlight place/word/sentence which lead to your decision
