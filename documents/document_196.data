```, but I am not sure what method to pass that too, or what the "raw send" method is in sc
any sweet tools to map out conversation trees? Looks like others are using mind mapping tools

Anyone has a detailed process how to deploy a botkit slack app i can host on beepboop? Thanks
why not just use heroku <@U37C5V3HT>
Hi everyone !
<@U4T9L1AF4> what up
abinash_mohanty: you can use Heroku or AWS free tier for the deployment. Let me know if you need any help in this. :+1:

Hi All! i have a response time issue ( takes more that 3 sec to respond) can anyone help me how to handdle time issue?
to send message in slack
jaykishor: how are handling and working on the response? DM me, maybe I'd be able to help!
Thanks <@U0Y7H2F3M> I was looking out for a detailed instruction how to get this hosted as I'm a designer :slightly_smiling_face: I found beepboop also quite easy!
Hi all, I 'm trying to delay the firing of a convo.say in order to let an API call go through without the conversation ending prematurely. Could anyone advise on how to do this?
Hey, why does it seem as if all popular bot frameworks are in Node? Not hating on the tools as long as they achieve the objective. I just want to know if there's a particular reason.
Hey, how easy is it to plug in a bot written in a different lang or even way to existing framework?
This is the first framework I'm looking at and I'm wondering whether it can work with what I have already
This doesn't seem possible
Under this <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/readme-studio.md#adding-studio-features-to-an-existing-bot>
"If you've already got a bot built with Botkit..."
I'm guessing the converse is not possible?
Also anyone working with the FB api directly having issues with not recieving the postbacks?
Even though I have subscribed to postbacks.
As in using callbacks to wait for the API response?
Bear with me, my thoughts are all over the place.
are you using python *and* botkit?
devwolf: Do you have any detailed tutorial how to host my existing botkit repo onto heroku? I can try.. Thanks
Also I could read the docs for this but quick question. Can I write content for the bot in json/yaml etc?
how does slackbot work with a node cluster?
In other words, if my node cluster is supporting team A and team B, how should I go about separating messages to A users from B users?
I can't be the first person to try to use this configuration...
Its not a question of how *I* send out messages, but if I've load-balanced to two node servers, is there a recommended way to route messages to each? or do people usually do it some other way?
Hello. I am working through the following tutorial: <https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html>
I am at the part where you execute your python script so that you can get your bot id
I am getting the following problem: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:749)
From what I can tell I need to access my company's CA instead of whatever the default thing is, but for the life of me I can't figure out how to repoint it..must be missing something
DefaultVerifyPath's points at /usr/local/ssl/certs ,but i'm on windows
I changed the environment variable for SSL_CERT_DIR to point at my own folder, but that doesn't seem to be reflected when using python
Hi <@U0Y7H2F3M>
i get the time out error while sending message
so can you pls help me how to takkle the time issue to send message ini Slack channel
kellyr: i just ran into this problem! have you setup <http://localtunnel.me|localtunnel.me> so you have a url for your slack bot to access?
I ended up disabling the cert validation because I couldn't figure out what the problem was.
Supposedly Python should be able to use the windows cert store, but it didn't seem to be finding my cert.
are you trying to do local dev or production?
local dev for now
I am receiving the following error on this line: AT_BOT = "&lt;@" + BOT_ID + "&gt;"
TypeError: must be str, not NoneType
it looks like a string to me..whats the grief?
I see, it wasn't able to retrieve the BOT_ID above, nevermind
Do you guys have experience with bot pricing? Based on bot functionalities maybe? Or level of integration? Any feedback would help! :slightly_smiling_face:
It would be nice if the SlackClient threw an exception when it couldn't connect instead of just returning False..I have no indication as to why it failed
my token is correct
peterjavorkai: what platform are you building for? if its slack, i would probably follow something relatively similar to how they price. free or low cost for certain features and then a middle and premium tier for more features. check out <https://statsbot.co/pricing>
Thanks <@U4HG47ZGD> , I'm building for messenger but this is a good reference, thanks! :slightly_smiling_face:
gotcha. on a mac? make sure you have homebrew installed and latest openssl
Who are you charging <@U3XPG218R>
Mostly SMEs <@U04SM6T2H> in developing world
Windows
sigh..so I just added debugging code and the reason it is failing to connect is because it cant validate the cert
I don't know why its so hard to use the freaking windows cert store
seems archaic
oooh. rough
I disabled the cert validate for requests, but I guess its separate code for the connection
after spending like 3 hours trying to figure out how to use the windows cert store
looking deeper into the source, it looks like both the websocket AND the requests libraries
have their own .pem files
this is one of the reasons we're recommending people migrate from RTM (where persistent connections per team are likely open in each process, therefore this routing concern exists) to Web API + Events API (where you just need a store accessible from each process that contains the a valid token for each team).
<@U4TPC6XV0>: that tutorial is very specific to running on linux. earlier, another member in here mentioned it didn't work right on mac either.
perhaps this tutorial might be a useful introduction for you, it has a python example app and explains the use of some our latest tools: <https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/enhancing-slacks-events-api-7535827829ab>

Does botkit do SMS?
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/botkit-sms>
not in the main branch yet, but this and some other options are in the pipeline
<@U429PB4DT> Please stay on topic in general (unless this pertains to bot building?)
What is conversation management?
