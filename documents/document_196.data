U0HPNTZ8Q : Do you mean another channel on this team? Or do you mean another team?
U0HPNTZ8Q : I can't find any channel about dart on this team...
U0HPNTZ8Q : Android? iOS? Windows?
U0LC44MLH : Got it already. 
U0LC44MLH : Im referring to another team
U0LC44MLH : Found their invite page over the net
U19J7PF7T : hi everynoe
U19J7PF7T : anyone knows why mi message is not getting formatted? ```bot.reply(message, {
            "attachments": [
                {
                    "title": "Here is the title",
                    //"color": '#3498db',
                    "fields": [
                        {
                            "title": "new event",
                            "color": "#c0392b",
                            "value": "To **create** a new event",
                            "short": false
                        }
]..etc```

U19J7PF7T : color is not responding in the "fields"
U0YQS1FAR : Color only applies at the top level like you have commented out. It's the little bar on the left, not the text color
U19J7PF7T : So i can't style the field's text?
U0YQS1FAR : You can use markdown formatting, but not change the text color as far as I'm aware
U19J7PF7T : Got it thanks!
U04SM6T2H : IF you use markdown in one of those fields
U04SM6T2H : you have to tell slack to expect it
U04SM6T2H : there is a mrkdown_in parameter
U19J7PF7T : ```{    "text": "*bold* `code` _italic_ ~strike~",
    "username": "markdownbot",
    "mrkdwn": true
}```

U19J7PF7T : that one? or its another???
U19J7PF7T : :confused:
U04SM6T2H : another one!
U19J7PF7T : ooops
U19J7PF7T : got it
U19J7PF7T : ```"mrkdwn_in": ["text", "pretext"]```
U04SM6T2H : "mrkdwn_in": ["text", "pretext"]
U19J7PF7T : that one?
U04SM6T2H : yup
