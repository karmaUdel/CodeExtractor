U4872964V : a live variable? What is this magic
U4872964V : I think you should take a step back and think about what it is you actually want
U6ASZU4EB : Haha I'm using elm-form and I'm also very new to Elm so I feel that this should be super easy to accomplish, but that I'm tripping myself up
U4872964V : ok, never used that, seems like advanced usage if you are new :slightly_smiling_face:
U6ASZU4EB : Btw this is off topic but we are looking for Elm developers (freelancers/consultants). I saw that you're Swedish, you don't happen to available for work? We're based in Stockholm
U3FJSB596 : <@U6ASZU4EB> We have a <#C0LUAGWRK|jobs> channel. You can try there?
U4872964V : well, I am a consultant so it may be interesting, however I have plenty to do as it is right now
U4872964V : check in <#C0HQ1ST0F|sweden> too
U6ASZU4EB : Alright tack! I'll be in this channel trying to learn Elm all summer. Let me know if you have some time off spring/winter for consulting.
U2GPAEU1L : <@U6ASZU4EB> Let the journey begin! :smile: I remember that moment
It's been almost a year now, and I still love Elm. Great journey

U2SR9DL7Q : Would anyone mind helping me understand the use of `andThen` ?I have two update functions:
```
ShuffleList -&gt;
            ( model, Random.generate SetFirstPlayer &lt;| shuffle model.dominoes )

SetFirstPlayer newSet -&gt;
           ( model, Random.generate (SetGame newSet) (<http://Random.int|Random.int> 1 4) )
```

A button in my view calls `ShuffleList` which generates a value, but I need a second random value so `SetFirstPlayer` is then called and that finally passes both randomly generated values to `SetGame` where additional logic is performed and the model is updated. 

I know there's a cleaner way to do this with `Cmd.batch` and I'm thinking `Random.andThen`, but I'm having trouble stringing it all together.

U2SR9DL7Q : Alternatively, perhaps map may be more appropriate...
U5J0H2NS2 : Random.pair ?
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U5J0H2NS2> Oh! I somehow skipped over that one. That could work, but then I need to unpack the tuple for the SetGame function right?
U5J0H2NS2 : Just deconstruct it when pattern matching in update I think
U2SR9DL7Q : cool. Thanks!
U5J0H2NS2 : RandomGenerated (rnd1, rnd2) -&gt;
U2SR9DL7Q : I am readjusting to the flexibility of pattern matching in FP languages
U65B9414J : Folks I'm a bit confused by nameGenerator : Generator String
nameGenerator =
  Random.Extra.sample ["Alice", "Bob", "Carole"]
    |&gt; Random.map (Maybe.withDefault "Alice")

U65B9414J : Here what is it that nameGenerator is returning.
U65B9414J : I'm having trouble understanding type annotation of the function
U4872964V : <@U65B9414J> what, the `Generator String` or something else?
U65B9414J : yes what is `Generator String`. Is it returning Generator of type String
U65B9414J : This is from reading of <https://robots.thoughtbot.com/elms-universal-pattern>
U4872964V : It's an abstract data type, defined in <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Random>
U65B9414J : Ah that helps. Thanks a bunch.
U65B9414J : By the way I searched for Generator at <http://package.elm-lang.org/> and did not find any hit. Is there any other way to search which scans across various packages.
U4872964V : Hmm, not sure
U4872964V : I guess that could be improved for sure
U0LPMPL2U : <@U65B9414J> on macOs, I use a combination of the Dash and Alfred apps to search documentation
U0LPMPL2U : There's also <https://klaftertief.github.io/elm-search/> that allows searching by type signature
U4872964V : <@U0LPMPL2U> yes, but not by data type
U4872964V : which could be fixed I suppose
U0LPMPL2U : it already allows searching for function names
U0LPMPL2U : seems like searching for type definitions isn't too much of a jump
U4872964V : it also allows things like "user:norpan" (reading the source code) :slightly_smiling_face:
U4872964V : <https://github.com/klaftertief/elm-search/issues/16>
U0CK8CJ5D : Regarding the elm-search… Yes, adding those features is not a problem. The exposed types and aliases are not contained in the index, though. I started a rewrite some time ago with a different focus and backlogged adding those features, and then I started a different pet project and backlogged working on elm-search. Maybe I should just hack in some features into the current version… Just for some context.
U39DE7RQ9 : I need help. Im using rtfeldmans SPA example to build my own SPA. Instead of using http requests im using ports against firebase. Now I have a problem in my update function where my subscription returns a list of forms (my own type Form) and should be convertet / mapped to a model for a sub page holding a list of forms.```
subscriptions : Model -&gt; Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
    let
        getAllFormsSub =
            Ports.gotAllPublicForms (Decode.decodeValue jsonFormListDecoder)
    in
        Sub.batch
            [ Sub.map HomeLoaded getAllFormsSub
            ]
```
And my update:
```
case ( msg, page ) of
( HomeLoaded (Ok subModel), _ ) -&gt;
                { model | pageState = Loaded (Home subModel) } =&gt; Cmd.none
```
And the compile error:
```
0:38:39 client.1   |  Function `Home` is expecting the argument to be:
20:38:39 client.1   |      HomePage.Model
20:38:39 client.1   |  But it is:
20:38:39 client.1   |      List Form
```
How do I map the list of forms to the model HomePage.Model and where?

U4872964V : What does `HomePage.Model` look like
U39DE7RQ9 : ```type alias Model =
    { forms : List Form
    }
```

U4872964V : Ok, so maybe `Loaded (Home { forms = subModel })`
U39DE7RQ9 : yay! Tanks <@U4872964V>
U6ASXAHUZ : Hi there folks, first time here (:
U6ASXAHUZ : I'm new to Elm, but I've worked a bit on some other functional langs
U6ASXAHUZ : I've started reading a bit around how to use Protocols, like I'm used to do in closure, but I didn't get that far
U6ASXAHUZ : I wonder how I could write the commented part of the code
