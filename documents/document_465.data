U23SA861Y : you always need to choose between one or more things
U23SA861Y : you don't get the option of a case/if returning nothing
U23SA861Y : what they return could be an empty `div` or a `text ""`, but it has to be something
U2SR9DL7Q : spoiled for choice
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U23SA861Y> thank you *very* much, and <@U0FP80EKB>_  as well
U64M3DF1B : <#C12KMAYJX|elm-mdl> I'm on elm 0.18 and using debois/elm-mdl - and this piece will not agree with me at all :cry: 
```
menuItemView : AppState -&gt; String -&gt; Html Msg
menuItemView appstate name =
    <http://List.li|List.li>
        []
        [
            List.content
                [
                    Options.css "cursor" "pointer"
                ,   Options.attribute &lt;| Options.onClick (ShowMenuItemPane name)
                ]
                [
                    text name
                ]
        ]

```

I have the imports, the `type Msg = ... | ShowMenuItemPane` - but she tells me: 

```
The right side of (&lt;|) is causing a type mismatch.

167|                     Options.attribute &lt;| (Options.onClick (ShowMenuItem name)
                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(&lt;|) is expecting the right side to be a:

    Attribute m

But the right side is:

    Options.Property c Msg
```

U23SA861Y : do you even need the `Options.attribute &lt;|`
U64M3DF1B : ? perhaps no! I'll tell you in 2sec :slightly_smiling_face:
U2SR9DL7Q : depending on the mdl element, I've had to use Options.attribute... since mdl expect a `Style a` type
U64M3DF1B : :partyparrot3: you're amazing! thx!
U64M3DF1B : for reference - this is what works (thx to <@U23SA861Y>)```
            List.content
                [
                    Options.css "cursor" "pointer"
                ,   Options.onClick (ShowMenuItem name)
                ]
                [
                    text name
                ]

```

U64M3DF1B : that - at least - is NOT obvious if you scout the package documentation :slightly_smiling_face:
(well - perhaps it is obvious and I'm just not totally converted to reading the Elm way of typing and spec'ing the syntax)

U5ABF3BH7 : Hello! Does anyone have a very basic example in Elm of an app with new page, edit page, index page, etc.. (ruby on Rails platform with controllers, etc..). I am getting a bit lost in the complexity of the examples I see.
U5ABF3BH7 : I have all the data from the backend, that I decode into my Model.  I want to use the view of my FirstCallNew, I don't know how to enter that in
U5ABF3BH7 : ```main =    Html.programWithFlags
        { init = init
        , view = FirstCallNew.view
        , update = FirstCallNew.update
        , subscriptions = FirstCallNew.subscriptions
        }```

U5ABF3BH7 : Can I do something like  ```view = FirstCallNew.view Model.initwithParams(case_id)``` or something like that. The case_id being the params that help me retrieve my data
U5ABF3BH7 : ?
U23SA861Y : so, the way you handle the initial render is you appropriately set init you init state such that view renders correctly with that data
U5ABF3BH7 : Let's say I have my record with all the fields with the values from extracting them with decoding. Is there a simpler way then having to write
U5ABF3BH7 : all the values. I must be stuck on something stupid.
U23SA861Y : I don't follow you, you need to be explict about how your data maps to your view
U5ABF3BH7 : can I write something like init = FirstCallNew.view.init model (where model is what I got from decoding)?
U5ABF3BH7 : <@U23SA861Y> let me try again
U23SA861Y : no, your code hasn't even run by that point so how have you decoded anything
