    String -&gt; Msg```
Yeah, so maybe I dont understand what you are trying to do.
Do you want the string of the new value in the field on `HandleField`?
I was following this for the  Custom Event Handler <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Events#on>
I was just trying to track a keydown and then I guess pass the string
then I wanted to figure out how to track a cut and paste as well
and backspace etc
basically track anyway that the field could be modified
Okay. I see.
Ive never done this exactly, but I bet you could make a custom html event handle that returns `(KeyCode, String)`
Where the keycode is an `Int`
So you can get the value and the key code of what happened most recently in one go.
Yea there is this <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/keyboard/1.0.1/Keyboard>
But I still don't know where to go from here :confused:
Thats a little different I think.
So that listens to all mouse events in the whole window.
Thats not what you want right?
True
Hold on a second
