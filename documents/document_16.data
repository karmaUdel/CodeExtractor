```
so the map with number keys version is ~ 10x slower
for a size 1000 &lt;thing&gt;
right
perhaps a smaller input would better represent real use cases
my guess is that for vectors it will be O(1) no matter the size
well it's a bit of a generalisation, but you get what I mean
"real use cases" depends on the use case. that's why when someone asks "which is faster, x or y?" it's important to understand the use case
indeed
