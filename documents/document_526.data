U153UK3FA : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Fresheyeball/elm-return/latest> is a package that can remove some of the boilerplate
U3LUC6SNS : Thankyou <@U153UK3FA>!!
U153UK3FA : <@U3LUC6SNS> I wasn't sure if you wanted to sequence the Cmds (which you can't do)
U3LUC6SNS : <@U153UK3FA>, that works fine - actually, it works beautifully!
U153UK3FA : just to be clear, there is no guarantee that your login will complete before your search request.
U153UK3FA : if they depend that ordering (implicitly passing state through the model) then they'll likely fail under different network conditions
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U6C09T8HX> Just try to be a decent person who makes the world a bit better. I don't have a rationalization for why I do this.
U6CEJALSF : hey folks! new to elm and taking the knowthen course on elm beginners concepts.  I'm a JavaScript developer by day, which is a pretty natural progression into elm, I think.(link to _free_ course: <http://courses.knowthen.com/>)

U6CEJALSF : I hope to get to know Elm a lot better over the coming months, partly for self-enrichment, partly in order to convince my team that Elm is a big step in the right direction for web UIs.
U0JBSEGHY : I've got this message. ```type Msg    = Answer String
    | MakeCall String
    | IncomingCall Maybe String```

U0JBSEGHY : My update is giving me this error ```Pattern Main.IncomingCall has too few arguments.
220|         IncomingCall caller -&gt;
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Expecting 2, but got 1.```

U153UK3FA : <@U0JBSEGHY> `IncomingCall (Maybe String)`
U0JBSEGHY : I'm calling it from a subscription. ```subscriptions model =    Sub.batch
        [ incomingCall IncomingCall ....```

U0JBSEGHY : Oh
U0JBSEGHY : ```The argument to function `incomingCall` is causing a mismatch.
276|           incomingCall IncomingCall
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^
Function `incomingCall` is expecting the argument to be:

    String -&gt; msg

But it is:

    Maybe String -&gt; Msg
```

U0JBSEGHY : I just needed to add Maybe String to my port it seems
U0JBSEGHY : slowly getting the hang of this Types thing :slightly_smiling_face:
U3F8KG1DE : I thought so too but this way feels like a workaround. I mean perhaps there is another way to acheive the same goal i.e. to animate some div element?
U3F8KG1DE : <@U0JFGGZS6> I thought so too but this way feels like a workaround. I mean perhaps there is another way to acheive the same goal i.e. to animate some div element?
U153UK3FA : <@U3F8KG1DE> it is a workaround, Elm treats the DOM as being essentially ‘write only' and doesn't provide ways to look at the state of the DOM. All attempts to look at the DOM require doing some kind of workaround.
U153UK3FA : The simplest way to do what you want is to explicitly set the height so you already know it
U3F8KG1DE : <@U153UK3FA> This is what I have actually done but this mean I will have to adjust this height every time I modify size of my div.


in above conversation, code/s mentioned has issue/s?
	If Yes:
	1.Bad	2.Very bad
	If No:
	1.Good	2.Very good


How confident are you?
	1.Low
	2.Average
	3.High

Optional!
can you highlight place/word/sentence which lead to your decision
