How do I integrate API gateway with a custom bot (with subscription to events)? I see only integration with slash command? Don't find any documentation on it. Could someone help me out?
my bot is not responding to any messages after following the setup guide. event subscription's verified and enabled, is there any way to debug what's wrong?
which setup guide?
also where is your bot being hosted, also carefully verify all your web endpoint urls
slack integration guide from readme. actually i'm seeing replies now after _reinstalling_ app
where can i find docs on all the events botkit supports? like _direct_message_
and what URL would I use for a slashcommand integration?
i'm probably not finding the right place to get more documentation on botkit. help would be appreciated :smile:

thank you! i am using local environment with ngrok
be sure to join and search the <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> channel too — tons of good info in there
so your url is whatever the output is in ngrok
<http://string.ngrok.com|string.ngrok.com> etc
ok, i'm guessing its just i'm using the starter kit and slash command is not set up
the starter kit is jsut botkit with some events specific docs
it supports the full range of slack integrations
its just that slash commands is kind of a legacy integration, so the examples are a bit long in the tooth
we are working on refactoring the docs to be more inline with the realities of slack as it is today, but its tricky
<@U0V93GE5R> when you say "as it is today" is that just the events API?
my opinion is that everyone should be making bots with the events api, for a number of reasons, but as long as other integrations are available, botkit will support them
but I think we could stand to improve how they are documented.
it is possible to add slash commands to the starter kit though!
you can handle it with
controller.on(‘slash_command', function(bot, payload) { … });
and the webhook url is _yoururl.com_/slack/receive
<@U04SM6T2H> : I'm running into the same issue, request URL verfied, but chat bot doesn't seem to pop
using the starter kit? self hosted?
hosting it on aws lambda
Any suggestions?
i dont have any direct experience with lamba sorry, but ill add it to my todo list
there are a few issues on the github and have been some threads on this slack about it though, you should try a search!

Hi bot builders/ Slack :heart: -  <http://Duuoo.io|Duuoo.io> is town (SF) any builders out there there is up for meeting to share learnings? (we are from the same studio as <https://walkiebot.co>)
Hi all - I am building a slack bot and want to spend the least amount of time worrying about deployment &amp; scaling. I want it to be available in the slack directory so that anyone can install it. I am OK with an interim solution for &lt;50 users and I am also OK spending $ here. Is something like botkit + beep boop the best route to take (a la <https://chatbotsmagazine.com/creating-a-simple-slack-bot-with-botkit-js-and-hosting-it-for-free-with-beepboop-2f5937bdb376>)?
I just made a new app and only subscribed to `<http://message.im|message.im>` events, but I'm getting other message-related events as well; is that expected behavior?
Just posted this problem on stackoverflow
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43564535/menu-shown-instead-of-button-on-android>
anyone seen it before?
only seems to be a problem on Android slack app
I'm just getting started with botkit for Facebook. And the starter guide in the welcome bot links to a 404 page. Any good resources or connections for up and running with botkit? I'm hitting a couple bumps with webhooks, verify tokens, and what URL to point the webhook when using Heroku. 
where are you seeing a 404? links seem to work for me here <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-facebook>
your urls will be something like <https://yourappname.herokuapp.com/facebook/receive>
You can also ask more questions in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> or <#C4MJKM145|botkit_studio>

A very old question how to use `bot.replyWithTyping` with timeout as whenever i use this, the typing indicator stays for a longer period of time before sending another reply.
*api*=channels.leave
When this says open source, it doesn't delineate whether it can be uploaded as a web app specifically open. Do you have more info on it?
acemtp: Slack is reporting some connectivity issues right now: <https://status.slack.com/>  which would likely effect usage of the web API.

does any know why in mac the speach to text service generates the next message “could not detect endianness after looking at the tail 0 non-zero byte string in a data stream of 366792 bytes. Is the bytestream really PCM data?”
superstrong: that's what slack is doing in their OAuth flow as well, maybe people are just copying their button placement?
They do the opposite in some cases: <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/article_attachments/209368387/request.png>
Either way, what works best in my opinion is when the primary action has more weight (different color).
Hi everyone! another question for botkit sending a random message. But the problem I'm having with the keywords such as `thanks`, `thank you`, `thanks a lot` etc.. in this case, the bot doesn't listen or ignoring such keywords especially `thanks` … but it's running fine the moment i change its keywords.. *what could be the problem?*
<@U04SM6T2H> do you know why it's causing the problem :thinking_face:
