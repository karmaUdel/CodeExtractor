U0HBN0L9M : <@U1C5VL0EQ>: I think slackbot is an exception...
U1G1G4HED : Thanks <@U11C8V57T> for explaining that
U1905D466 : Anyone here with a slack app / bot / software idea that is going to launch in the next 4 weeks?
U1G51L0NM : Hi all, my name Timotius from Indonesia. I wanna learn bot development. Anyone can help with which Channel I need to join and any basic tutorial ? Tx all
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U1G51L0NM>: most people here are using botkit, so join the <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> channel and they probably have some bit examples
U1G51L0NM : <@U0CS6NSF5>: tx
U1FF1FF0C : <@U1905D466>:  Me and my team are launching Halfway app and Halfway slackbot first week of July, check our website to know more <http://www.halfway-app.com|www.halfway-app.com> and our video  <https://youtu.be/zwM9S6ZyqaU>  Everybody else: I would be more than happy to hear your comments about our idea :wink:
U1905D466 : <@U1FF1FF0C>: shameless self promo: <http://puuush.com/funnel/the-beginning-of-slack-bot-marketing/|puuush.com/funnel/the-beginning-of-slack-bot-marketing/> I'm thinking of updating this page cause I've helped 12 more slack apps with marketing… Seems to be a growing market right?
U1GK1C13K : Hey guysI have a question.
U1GK1C13K : I've created a slackbot and it executes a command on my application, and every stdout I send it to slack using `convo.say` *But* there is a slight delay in-between messages and it seems that botkit terminates the conversation prematurely. How can I extend the conversation length?
U1E740LSV : ```bot.startConversation(message, function(err, convo) {          convo.task.timeLimit = 10 * 60 * 1000
})
```

U0GH3SKUJ : Hey guys i created a bot can you tell me how to catch the event if bot is down due to some error?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0GH3SKUJ>: you can't unless you request extra permissions with the user token to get access to the channels' history
U0GH3SKUJ : <@U0CS6NSF5>: why i need channel's history
U0GH3SKUJ : i want to just catch the event when bot goes down
U0CS6NSF5 : the bot will only receive the events while it is connected, if your bot is down when a message is sent you will not see it, so you need the HTTP API to catch-up on messages you missed
U0CS6NSF5 : if it's a message, you need the channel's history
U0CS6NSF5 : for other events you will need other permissions
U0GH3SKUJ : thx <@U0CS6NSF5> . one more question. I was using bot token to create IM channel with (im.open) and web API token ( retrieved test token / oAuth ) for posting to it. It was working until 3 days ago, something changed that made it stop working?
U0CS6NSF5 : Why don't you post with the bot token?
U0GH3SKUJ : I am switching, at the time of development it was working now it broke.. just pointing out
U0GH3SKUJ : either that or something changed in our branch that i haven't caught yet. :slightly_smiling_face:
U0CS6NSF5 : Probably :)
U0HBN0L9M : <@U0GH3SKUJ>: when the bot goes down you receive a RTM.close event. You don't know, however, what is the reason for that
U0HBN0L9M : when you attempt to reconnect, you can have several scenario- you can reconnect: it was just an API/websocket glitch
- you get token_revoked: the app has been uninstalled
- other errors ?

U0GH3SKUJ : thx <@U0HBN0L9M>
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U0HBN0L9M>: the connection can go down without a close event :)
U0GT29N3A : For us, we mostly get `account_inactive` when the app has been uninstalled (I don't see many `token_revoked`).
U0HBN0L9M : sorry, yes, account inactive <@U0GT29N3A>
U0HBN0L9M : how does that happen <@U0CS6NSF5>
U0CS6NSF5 : if your connection drops, unless you meant a JS event :slightly_smiling_face:
U0GT29N3A : Also, the spec says you can send an empty message before closing the connection. So if you receive an empty message, the connection will close just after that.
U196ZMU3Y : Any iOS bot makers here going to dive into the new iMessaging api? I think I am going to crack that open this week.
U0ERLS5EH : <@U196ZMU3Y>: I'd be interested to see what you find. I haven't looked into it much yet but my initial take on it is that it's similar to a slash command in Slack. I don't think it can actually read the conversation's text but instead it lets you run an app that sends something to the conversation.
U196ZMU3Y : Yeah, that is essentially my limited understanding of it as well.
U196ZMU3Y : I started a channel <#C1GSE00JJ> if anyone wants to join me in playing with the new api's and the potential with bots there.
U1H0N6NS3 : hey guys, anybody know how to create a catchall method using conversations? so if none of the controller.hears() match the incoming msg then the bot can say some generic msg like "Sorry, I didnt get that. Can you rephrase your request". This is with reference to a facebook bot.
U11C8V57T : <@U1H0N6NS3> Also, this is a question better suited for the <#C0AV5N8NA> channel. (I assume you're using botkit due to your mention of `controller.hears`.)
U1H0N6NS3 : thx <@U11C8V57T>. will repost on <#C0AV5N8NA>
U0K7U9LUC : Hi guys. I am cleaning channels in one of my slack team. In fact, I would be able to merge <#C04SM6TAX> and <#C04SM6TAK>, as they both deserve the same goal: chit-chat, out of topic talks. There is nothing about merging in channel settings, so how would you achieve this ? Thank you for tricks/hints
U1DM2B4SY : <@U0K7U9LUC> -&gt; don't think it's possible to merge channel content like that, it was requested some time ago, but it's not been implemented from what I've seen: <https://twitter.com/slackhq/status/465666187545051136>
U0K7U9LUC : <@U1DM2B4SY>: I came to same conclusion, thus why I asked for some _tricks_
U1DM2B4SY : You can probably write a bot to gather all messages in Channel A, all messages in Channel B, and write them all to Channel C, but is that really worth it? When we went through the same type of thing, we just gave our users about a weeks notice to wrap up conversations in Channel A, informing them we'd be moving those types of chats to Channel B, then when the date came we archived Channel A so it was still searchable but not writeable
U07VCKRUK : You can export your channel data (<http://my.slack.com/services/export>) and then import (<http://my.slack.com/services/import>) just <#C04SM6TAX> -&gt; <#C04SM6TAK> ... _however_ we've mostly heard regret with merging channels this way.  Archives can become very confusing in the event two simultaneous conversations are combined.
U1116QM2Q : quick question, how can i invite some of my other co-workers to this dev4slack team? do i need to have them go to the website and request an invite?
U1116QM2Q : or can i invite them myself?
U0V93GE5R : It would probably be better to just paste them the link and let them do the request
U1116QM2Q : alright thanks
U187QR60N : waiting for the host
U1FCT2KL5 : Hello I encounter a mistake trying to deploy my bot, I don't understand it and I don't know which channel is suited for this mistake: —&gt;  [Error: unsupported_grant_type - grant type not supported] statusCode: 400  
Can you help me?

U0KECURAT : <@U1FCT2KL5>: are you using a specific framework?
U1FCT2KL5 : such as ?
U0KECURAT : well what did you write your bot in?
U1FCT2KL5 : node.js with botkit express body-parser
U0KECURAT : <@U1FCT2KL5>: then <#C0AV5N8NA> is probably for you, but it doesn't look like a botkit specific error though, where are you deploying it and when in the process does this happen?
U1FCT2KL5 : I deploy it via heroku
U1FCT2KL5 : I solved my problem, it was an oAuth line that I forgot to delete.
U1FCT2KL5 : thank you
U0TGHKPEU : may i know what cause this display in slack when it response to slash commands
U0TGHKPEU : other response seems to work well except this one
U0TGHKPEU : in some other team the response are in json format while in other team are not
U11FSNKL0 : hmm... you must be answering with format text/html instead of application/json maybe?
U11FSNKL0 : anyway I'm not sure what is type=brb...
U11FSNKL0 : you will need to give more context... what do you expect to happen in that message? it seems that it is an attachment?
U0TGHKPEU : thanks, well try that, only the message should only display on slack
U0H1Y7M1S : hi team! i work at <http://segment.com|segment.com> and we're looking for bots who are using segment for tracking for a case study / customer success thing. if you use segment, please DM me! t shirt and swag in exchange for your time :slightly_smiling_face:
U0HBN0L9M : <@U18HVKW5P> not yet
U0DKRF8DA : <@U18HVKW5P>: we do that right now with reaction buttons. not ideal, but it works :slightly_smiling_face:
U04TLHGSC : I liked <#C04U80BHT>
U14H7AYJU : <https://trello.com/c/DVrJLbxX/12-interactive-messages>
U14H7AYJU : re: conversational links - looks like it's in the roadmap
U1HKHF4AW : <@U14H7AYJU>: nice! Any idea when it may be released? We've been using reactions like <@U0DKRF8DA> as well <http://cl.ly/0p3g1a3r2t1f>
U1116QM2Q : eh why was the channel <#C04U80BHT> archived?
U04SM6T2H : UNCLEAR
U04SM6T2H : I am currently yelling at someone about it
U04SM6T2H : The ability to archive a channel has been restricted :wink:
U07060PG9 : about that humans.txt expectation-setting… :slightly_smiling_face:  reminds me of IRC room management challenges.
U1116QM2Q : eh :smile:
U1HM7TWC9 : Howdy!
U196ZMU3Y : they also brought back painful memories of when I was working with emojis and facebook in <#C04SM6TAX>
U1HNA1DCH : hello there
U1HNA1DCH : does anyone know how to use the file.upload api to get emails uploaded like this?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U1HNA1DCH>: I think that is implemented using private APIs right now
U1HQFCJUC : Hi people, I'm just getting started with bots, going to create a slack bot first. Are facebook bots similar or every network has its own way to handle bots ?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U1HQFCJUC>: they all some common ground and then unique features, some libraries like `botkit` allow you to integrate with both
U1HQFCJUC : I'm starting with botkit then, but is there a way of requesting an Api through http request ? I see there is webhooks but it doesn't seems to be integrated inside the bot, am I right ?
U0CS6NSF5 : <@U1HQFCJUC>: FB bots work with webhooks and Slack's right now work with websockets (although they are working on a version based on webhooks)
U1HRFME1J : Hi all, don't suppose anyone has any good examples of using timeouts inside bots for escape non responsive conversations, thanks...
U1HQFCJUC : <@U0CS6NSF5>: is it actually possible to make a bot requesting an url without publiqhing a slack app in the "store" (which is, from what i understand, one way of doing it) ? I would basically like to make a http get inside of a botkit controller.hears()
U1AQ8MY3U : :grin:
U1HNA1DCH : <@U0CS6NSF5>  agreed. it must be some private api.
U1HNA1DCH : <@U0CS6NSF5>: and they arent interested in sharing..
U1HNA1DCH : <@U0CS6NSF5>: so, i've been trial and error trying to figure out what the private api is... i can set the subjectline and the from... if i send in a json blob that looks like this
U1HNA1DCH : as the file
U1HNA1DCH : {            "subject": "cho cho cho2",
            "to": 
            "Michael&lt;mx@gmail.com&gt;"
            ,
            "from": 
            "Michael &lt;mx@gmail.com&gt;"
            ,
            "cc": [

            "Michael &lt;mxgmail.com&gt;"
            ],
            "comments_count":0
        }

U1HNA1DCH : u can see the subject is correctly "cho cho cho2"
U1HNA1DCH : but i cant seem to upload the actual email content and get it to understand me
U0HUTFBHS : <@U1HQFCJUC>: That should be possible, what's your use case?  I've made many slack bots, none of which are in the app store.
U196ZMU3Y : My slack app isn't a bot, but it isn't in the store either.
U196ZMU3Y : I actually couldnt figure out how to submit it
U196ZMU3Y : And I am still not sure how I got so many installs for it.
U0GGT8K88 : hello... ! question wrt scopes and add-to-slack access request. the only scope we're asking for is groups:write. The access request it seems to be translating into is "we'll be able to modify information about your private channels, including name and purpose, as well as archive and create new ones..". 
we're definitely unable to modify, name, purpose, archive any pvt channels that our bot itself didn't create. The access-request-message above is misleading for someone looking to integrate. any advice?

U11FSNKL0 : <@U0GGT8K88>: I think you mean groups:write... that will be added to the "user token", not the "bot token"... so the user needs to be a member of the group IMO
U11FSNKL0 : the problem with "groups" is that only members have access to them, so "others" can't do things on them
U0GGT8K88 : <@U11FSNKL0>: you're right, groups:write. the bot creates pvt channels in other teams for its team members to sync with certain pvt channels in our own team.

U11FSNKL0 : the bot creates the channel... or the user token? if you go to a group, it says created by @botname?
U0GGT8K88 : no if you're the admin of the team (or the person that integrated) it'll say <@U11FSNKL0> created the team
U11FSNKL0 : right, so that user needs to be a member of the group... then using the user token (that is from that user) you can change the purpose, etc...
U11FSNKL0 : don't use the bot token, use the user token
U0GGT8K88 : <@U11FSNKL0>: right, i believe that's what we're doing to accomplishing the workflow... my concern is the add-to-slack access request message (above) that indicates to you that we have access to all your pvt channels
U0GGT8K88 : which isn't true
U11FSNKL0 : no... the user has access to the groups that user has access... and that user can do everything on those groups. is specific to groups. imagine you install a bot, and the bot can access all the groups that other users created, that would be a privacy problem
U11FSNKL0 : I can install a bot here, and read all groups from all users
U0GGT8K88 : mm, right, so, sorry,  you agreeing with me that the message is misleading? :slightly_smiling_face:
U11FSNKL0 : I mean I see your point... but I don't think Slack will change anything about it...
U0GGT8K88 : 'your private channels'; i think I get that 'your' in that message refers to you <@U11FSNKL0> and not to the team
U0GGT8K88 : hmm...   i see
U11FSNKL0 : yes, the user <@U11FSNKL0> that installed the bot
U0GGT8K88 : yup... thx <@U11FSNKL0>
U1J34EACX : Is there anyway for a bot to start a private conversation with its user not as the bot but as a "child" bot?
U150ECGLS : Hello there! I just published `botkit-sms` on npm. It allows you to create SMS bots using `botkit`'s core functionality and Twilio's Programmable SMS API. I hope you find it useful :smiley:<https://www.npmjs.com/package/botkit-sms>

U150ECGLS : Now you can write SMS bots with `botkit`! :smile:
U1E7WGWRM : Hello Guys!! How do i stop my slack bot from responding when it is not mentioned in a channel. I am using this code as of now.
U1E7WGWRM : controller.hears(['.*'], ['direct_message', 'direct_mention', 'mention', 'ambient'], (bot, message) =&gt; {    try {
        if (message.type == 'message') {
            if (message.user == bot.identity.id) {
                // message from bot can be skipped
            }
            else if (message.text.indexOf("&lt;@U") == 0 &amp;&amp; message.text.indexOf(bot.identity.id) == -1) {
                // skip other users direct mentions
            }
            else {

U0HPNTZ8Q : you should remove that `ambient` up there
U0HPNTZ8Q : also, this should probably better go to <#C0AV5N8NA> :simple_smile:
U0GH3SKUJ : Hi
U0GH3SKUJ : Can you tell me the event which is fired when someone remove the app from their team
U0GH3SKUJ : I have a Application in which a bot is present when someone add it by using `Add to slack` we can catch it where the redirect url is but when application is remove which event is fired?
U0GH3SKUJ : And another question is I used to show direct message through the bot for the first message it shows the bot icon and for another message it doesn't show. Is there any way to forcefully show bot icon in every message, i am using `chat.postMessage`

U0N9E8309 : Hi guys,I have played with <http://wit.ai|wit.ai> and <http://api.ai|api.ai> so far and created a todo list simple bot for messenger(in beta testing still). I like <http://api.ai|api.ai> but it's not open source and it's not cheap obviously.  Any alternatives that you'd suggest? thx!

U0HBN0L9M : <@U0GH3SKUJ>: no event fired (that would be a great addition btw. ping <@U0D7LHNTX>), just the RTM connection is closed, and reconnect attempts give `account_inactive`
U1JC5H3SS : Hi Guys,
U1JC5H3SS : I'm just a newbie
U1JC5H3SS : Can anyone guide me through developing a bot
U1JC5H3SS : I have downloaded Node.js
U1JC5H3SS : but coudn't do further in it
U1JC5H3SS : around the internet, I find everywhere it is saying to start with installation.. "npm install --save"
U1JC5H3SS : but whenever I type this in node.js it throws me this error "pm should be run outside of the node repl"
U1JC5H3SS : could someone walk me through this please ?
U181429A9 : <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit>
The readme has a lot of guides and steps to follow

U1JC5H3SS : Yeah, thats the page which lead me to this group
U181429A9 : <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit#getting-started>
is the next step really

U1JC5H3SS : Thanks a lot Carl, but my problem here is installing botkit
U1JC7HJMC : Hi guys, I need some help with regards to slash command and direct message. The scenario is as follows: 1. User type slash command, 2. Then the code that listens to "slash_command" is being executed. 3. I would like to start a private conversation (from slash command) with asking a user a question so that he can answer "yes" for example:  ``` bot.startPrivateConversation(message, function (err, convo) { convo.say("Hello"); .... ``` 4. I'm getting an error "Cannot use the RTM API to send messages." . Questions  A - What am I doing wrongly, where to look etc. ? Additional info: Things like reply privately or publicly works fine for me.  &gt;&gt;&gt;  Thank you for understanding I will appreciate any help a lot :slightly_smiling_face:, thank you
U1JC5H3SS : Can you help me with that
U11FSNKL0 : <@U1JC7HJMC>: I think that if you use slash commands, is a separate part of botkit than the part of the bot, you need to ask for "bot" scope to be a bot too. in general slash commands answers the http call directly, and you just show that message to the user. but you could ask for slash command "and" bot, and do whatever you want
U0GH3SKUJ : Hi  <@U0D7LHNTX> is there any way to catch the event if someone remove my app from their slack team ?
U0D7LHNTX : Not at this time <@U0GH3SKUJ>  Right now we just unceremoniously dump the connection and return `invalud_auth` on further calls to `rtm.start`
U0D7LHNTX : <@U1JC7HJMC> you will need to ask for additional scopes to send a DM from a slash command. Slash commands are designed for one-off interactions where you send a single response to a single command. But watch this space, there are improvements coming that will allow you to request confirmation on performing a slash command. 
U1JC7HJMC : <@U0D7LHNTX>:  from what I see the rtm service is not attached to the bot when using slash command, I tried to run `bot.startRTM(function (error, bot2) { bot2.startPrivateConversation` it did work, but now it replies twice so my guess is that I need to terminate the rtm service then, correct me if I'm wrong, or maybe the whole flow is wrong then ?
U0D7LHNTX : <@U1JC7HJMC>: I think you are getting confused. No surprise, the Slack platform can be a little confusing at times. DM me with the details of what you are trying to accomplish, and I can advise on the right approach.
U0TGHKPEU : Hello guys  what do you think the be problem when slash command display message in slack as json format. The  app response from the slash command is in json type with 200 status and content-type is application/json. I had receive one team that say it display as json format message in their slack while we are using the same slash command and didn't get that json format (just normal message which supposed it should)
U1HQFCJUC : <@U0TGHKPEU>: I had a similar issue, in my case the json wasn't well formated, have you tried to set your res_id as string ?
