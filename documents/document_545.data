U1C2DDDGD : <@U153UK3FA> Yeah I saw that. I'm assuming I want to use map2 (since I have two tasks and I don't care about sequence/order) so what does it look like to replace Cmd.batch with Tasks
U153UK3FA : You can't, there isn't a way to convert Cmds to tasks
U153UK3FA : <@U1C2DDDGD> what Cmds are you trying to sequence?
U1C2DDDGD : Two Http.send calls
U153UK3FA : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#toTask>
U153UK3FA : You can do http requests as tasks
U3SJEDR96 : `Task.map2 (\first second -&gt; *make them into a record or whatever) firstRequest secondRequest |&gt; Task.attempt MsgWhichTakesTheAppropriateResultType`
U1C2DDDGD : I think I'm starting to understand now… and if not then I will soon with the above info
U1C2DDDGD : Thank you <@U153UK3FA> and <@U3SJEDR96> !
U31FGNWCT : Do you have to specify all fields in HttpBuilder even if you don't need all of them?
U31FGNWCT : It's complaining:```
(|&gt;) is expecting the right side to be a:

    RequestBuilder () -&gt; a

But the right side is:

    RequestBuilder (List row) -&gt; Cmd (Tables.Msg row)
```

U31FGNWCT : God, I feel like I'm not learning anything. I haven't made a single move without getting into 3-hour-to-solve issue.
U41NK9BM4 : I'm not familiar with HttpBuilder  :white_frowning_face:
U31FGNWCT : Maybe you understand why it's complaining about types?
U31FGNWCT : Why on earth it takes unit as a first param
U6EV3H0N7 : could you post the code it's complaining about <@U31FGNWCT> ?
U31FGNWCT : ```getSortedList byColumn =
    HttpBuilder.get "someValidUrl"
        |&gt; withQueryParams [ ( "filter", Encode.encode 0 &lt;| queryParams byColumn.order ) ]
        |&gt; send handleSortedList
```

U6EV3H0N7 : the type param to `RequestBuilder` looks like it's the type of the response it expects. So using `()` is just to say "I don't expect any response from this request"
U6EV3H0N7 : (I think)
U6EV3H0N7 : ah okay, so I guess the type of `handleSortedList` is `Result Error (List row) -&gt; Tables.Msg row`?
U31FGNWCT : Yeah
U6EV3H0N7 : the type error is that:`HttpBuilder.get "someValidUrl"` has type `RequestBuilder ()`, `withQueryParams` adds query params to the request, but doesn't change the type

U6EV3H0N7 : so you're not telling the RequestBuilder what kind of response to expect
U6EV3H0N7 : so it's still the default `()`, but you want it to be `List row`
U6EV3H0N7 : So i suspect you want a `withExpect`
U6EV3H0N7 : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/lukewestby/elm-http-builder/latest/HttpBuilder#withExpect>
