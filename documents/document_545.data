Hi all, I'm in a situation where i have to decode a json array that has mixed types.  They're in a predictable pattern.  `[Int, Int, Int, String, Int]`
But in my limited experience, I create an type alias, and use that with decode pipeline.  however, i have no idea how i'd describe this.
you'll have to do this in two phases: decode the array, then decode the items
the first phase can use a `Decode.list Decode.value`
yes, but you keep the elements as undecoded values
ah, ok.  going to look at Decode.value right now.  that one is new to me.
Since you will be building an Elm data structure out of this, do you know what you want that to look like?
i would love to!
I assume a record with 5 fields of the correct type?
close, i was going to tuple with the string, then list int.
but the result will be the same either way.
You should avoid using a `List` when you want things to be a specific length.
ok, `Array` better?
