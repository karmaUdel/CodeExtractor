U6531GSTW : <@U23SA861Y> <https://jsonblob.com/6ecd993e-6290-11e7-ae4c-e793fe90c432>
U6531GSTW : used on this code <https://ellie-app.com/3HGC3s98j2xa1/4>
U23SA861Y : looks alright, but I think you might be reading the wrong file maybe?
U6531GSTW : can i link this url to the elm code?
U6531GSTW : or what do you mean by "wrong file"
U6531GSTW : this part of update reads the json link etc. :
U6531GSTW : LoadJson -&gt;            --( model, Http.send JsonLoaded (Http.getString "hello.txt") )
            --( model, Http.send JsonLoaded (Http.getString "shapes.json") )
            ( model
            , Http.send JsonLoaded
                (Http.get "<https://jsonblob.com/6ecd993e-6290-11e7-ae4c-e793fe90c432>"
                    (JD.field "Aufgaben" (JD.list aufgabe))
                )
            )

        JsonLoaded (Ok newListAufgaben) -&gt;
            ( { model | saved = newListAufgaben }, Cmd.none )

        JsonLoaded (Err error) -&gt;
            ( { model | show = "Error:  " ++ (toString error) }, Cmd.none )

U23SA861Y : heh, doesn't that link to the html page not the raw json blob
U6531GSTW : yes how can i upload such a raw json?
U23SA861Y : umm, well you need a server to host it. you do it through github maybe
U62V8HFJR : I'm getting a syntax error for this code snippet:```
module Src.Models exposing (..)

import Navigation

import Homework.Week4.Main as Week4

type Route = ReadmeRoute
           | Week4Route
           | NotFoundRoute

type alias Model =
    { week4 : Week4.Model
    , route : Route
    }
```

U62V8HFJR : ```-- SYNTAX PROBLEM ------------------------------------------- ././Src/Models.elm

I ran into something unexpected when parsing your code!

18|     { week4 : Week4.initModel
                ^
I am looking for one of the following things:

    "|"
    an equals sign '='
    whitespace
```

U62V8HFJR : I keep staring at this and don't see the issue -- am I just blind or is something weird going on?
U23SA861Y : hmm, I'm not seeing it either...
U62V8HFJR : my initial guess was that Elm didn't like numbers in identifiers (e.g. `week4` as the field in `Model`), but the REPL didn't seem to mind them
U23SA861Y : ohh the issues is where you are creating the model
U23SA861Y : record assignment uses `=` not `:`. The colon is used for the type declaration but in the assignment you need to use equals
U62V8HFJR : Oh, :facepalm:
U62V8HFJR : just looking at the wrong line
U62V8HFJR : yep, blind then. Thanks
U23SA861Y : line 18
