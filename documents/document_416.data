and the result that I always get is an Error regarding not being able to parse invalid JSON
Hey guys, wondering im struggling with types annotation where the type is two seperate words, but i think it clicked...if i get this right...when we see `view: Model -&gt; Html String` its basically shortHand for `view: Model -&gt; { recordTypeA : Html, recordTypeB: String }`
If i'm wrong, i'd love to understand what is really happenning
I think you're wrong
The raw type is `Html a` where `a` can be anything at first. You will then say that, in your particular use case, it will be a `String` becoming a `Html String`
For example, you have `Maybe a` using the same pattern where `a` will be the type of the value inside the `Maybe`
If you have an `Int` inside it, it will be a `Maybe Int`
For `Html`, the generic type `a` is the type of msg that the html can trigger
Thanks <@U1UGYHGCA> this makes much more sense than my initial though
I already posted this in general, but I guess it's actually a newbie question :sweat_smile:
Can somebody help me? :confused:
Hi everybody. What is the easiest way in elm to change dynamically style of some element?. I have button with Id and how can I choose and change its color? Should I try to use jQuery or actually exist some elm mechanism to do that?
Yeah, you can do an inline style
