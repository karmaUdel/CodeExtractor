U23SA861Y : or I believe so
U64MK7215 : how do i trigger 2 events with onclick?
U23SA861Y : hmm, which two events
U0M9CNX1A : <@U64MK7215> typically I will try to model this sort of situation with a single message that describes what the user did (FooButtonClicked) and handle the multiple things you want to happen in the update function. Don't forget you can extract/share functions between branches of your update case. 
U0JBSEGHY : How are people managing live reload with Elm projects. It looks like elm-live is unmaintained? Is everyone using webpack?
U0JBSEGHY : I would prefer not to use webpack if I can help it lol.
U0CLDU8UB : elm-live works fine
U0EUHKVGB : elm-live actually has some issues right now if you are also using elm-test to watch files
U2SR9DL7Q : Hey all. I have a strange conundrum. I'm trying to do some clever redirection in an SPA with the `Navigation` and `Routing` modules.
U2SR9DL7Q : I followed the method outlined in the Elm tutorial with great success, but found a follow up describing a 'push-state' model which I wanted to try so users could navigate to the various 'pages' from a navigation bar in the drawer. 
Unfortunately after giving it a try I found that while the link to the 'home' page works, the second page I'm testing with doesn't appear to work. 

Specifically, where I should be seeing ..../secondpage, I instead have to use /#secondpage from the original form. The button either fails to trigger the change silently or if I type what should be the proper URL into the browser, it triggers the 404 error. 

<https://github.com/sporto/elm-navigation-pushstate/blob/master/src/Main.elm> is the guide I have been following.

U2SR9DL7Q : Below are my _Routing.elm_ and relevant _Views.elm_ respectively. I am reasonably sure that my updates and messages match the example code.```
viewTestLink : List (Html Msg)
viewTestLink =
    [ a
        [ href paths.home
        , onLinkClick (ChangeLocation paths.home)
        ]
        [ text "Home" ]
    , a
        [ href paths.resume
        , onLinkClick (ChangeLocation paths.resume)
        ]
        [ text "Resume" ]
    ]
```
```
paths : { home : String, resume : String }
paths =
    { home = "/"
    , resume = "/resume"
    }


onLinkClick : msg -&gt; Attribute msg
onLinkClick message =
    let
        options =
            { stopPropagation = False
            , preventDefault = True
            }
    in
    onWithOptions "click" options (Decode.succeed message)


matchers : Parser (Route -&gt; a) a
matchers =
    oneOf
        [ map HomeRoute top
        , map ResumeRoute (s "resume")
        ]


parseLocation : Location -&gt; Route
parseLocation location =
    case parseHash matchers location of
        Just route -&gt;
            route

        Nothing -&gt;
            NotFoundRoute
```

U2SR9DL7Q : a link to the github: <https://github.com/tkshill/tkshill.github.io/blob/master/Main.elm> and a link to the site itself: <https://tkshill.github.io/> where if you click the drawer the problem can be seen.
U0JFGGZS6 : and you tried `parsePath` instead of `parseHash` ?
U2SR9DL7Q : ... I'm going to feel quite silly if that's the problem :neutral_face:
U2SR9DL7Q : So that helped! But now there seems to be the issue that it returns the 404 message on the initial page load.
U0JFGGZS6 : before or after it hits your Elm app?
U2SR9DL7Q : after. this is testing in elm reactor.
U2SR9DL7Q : so I redirects to my 404 div
U0JFGGZS6 : I've always used hash urls so not as familiar with the 'push state' style
U2SR9DL7Q : it's strange. the home button works. when the app starts, Navigation calls the `OnLocationChange` with the current address which should be _localhost:8000_
U0JFGGZS6 : hopefully someone else can weigh in.  This issue may be relevant. <https://github.com/evancz/url-parser/issues/35>
U2SR9DL7Q : okay, so I think I know why it's confused. The base directory UrlParser provides is localhost:8000 but the active address using elm reactor is localhost:8000/Main.elm
U2SR9DL7Q : so it thinks Main.elm is an invalid URL. I'd have to test outside of localhost to be certain.
U3SJEDR96 : You need server-side configuration to map every route to your elm-app
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U0JFGGZS6> this issue looks like exactly what is going on.
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U3SJEDR96> I _think_ I understand what you're saying, but I'm not sure what that means in terms of next steps. If I understand the problem now, this problem shouldn't occur on the live site. But I'm not sure what I would need to do to perform server side mapping in my test environment.
U5J0H2NS2 : <@U2SR9DL7Q> Sorry if I misunderstand your issue, but why don't you use hashed urls if you want client-side routing?
U2SR9DL7Q : I initially used hashed urls before linking up the navigation buttons. A small issue was just that the generated urls have the '#' symbol added in. It just happens that the sample code I found describing how to reroute from the href attribute in my buttons also described how to use push state to remove the '#' symbol. <@U5J0H2NS2> 
U2SR9DL7Q : Now it seems to be working, but the initial page when the app starts is being redirected to the pagenotfound response. 
U2SR9DL7Q : Specifically, the div I've set to appear for an invalid page request within the app appears, Not the browser one. So from there, I can use the nav drawer to go to the other pages as intended. 
U5J0H2NS2 : I see it on your webpage. The link ".../resume" works in the menu. But since this is not a hashed url, if I copy-paste it into the browser, I get 404
U2SR9DL7Q : Yup. But when it was hashed, the menu link didn't work. 
U5J0H2NS2 : Or if I click F5 to refresh
U2SR9DL7Q : And to access the resume page, I had to type '#resume' into the browser 
U5J0H2NS2 : I have found this article to be useful: <https://medium.com/elm-shorts/choosing-the-right-elm-spa-architecture-d6e8275f6899>
U2SR9DL7Q : At this point, I'm not bothered about the pound symbol. My priority is consistent navigation and page functionality... :( 
U2SR9DL7Q : This article... is very good. 
U2SR9DL7Q : Time to roll up my sleeves are figure things out.
U2SR9DL7Q : <@U5J0H2NS2> <@U3SJEDR96> <@U0JFGGZS6> thanks for the assistance!
U5J0H2NS2 : What if you change &lt;a href="/resume"&gt;Resume&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="/#resume"&gt;Resume&lt;/a&gt;
U2SR9DL7Q : Giving that a try right now
U5J0H2NS2 : Or you could use an elm-mdl List in the menu and assign proper msg-s to them. Then you could change the url with the Navigation package inside your update. This generates a new Msg. Then in the next update, you parse your new url .
U5J0H2NS2 : This would be more mdl-ish I guess
U2SR9DL7Q : well, I swapped out a mdl nav for a regular nav just to see if it was an mdl issue (it wasnt)
U2SR9DL7Q : ```[ Layout.link
       [ Layout.href paths.home
       , Options.attribute &lt;|
           onLinkClick &lt;|
               ChangeLocation paths.home
       ]
       [ text "Home" ]
   , Layout.link
       [ Layout.href paths.resume
       , Options.attribute &lt;|
           onLinkClick &lt;|
               ChangeLocation paths.resume
       ]
       [ text "Resume" ]
   ]
```

U2SR9DL7Q : This was the original idea. It's essentially the same as what it's doing now. 
But you're suggesting adding a separate msg for each URL?

U5J0H2NS2 : Yes. Or one common msg with the url as parameter
U2SR9DL7Q : so then... my `changeLocation` function would presumable use case statements to construct it's own urls, and pass those the `Navigation.newUrl` command...
U2SR9DL7Q : I'll try some of your suggestions. I need to re-read that medium article, and look into just what url is returned when the page first loads.
U66RFDZ8F : Hello everyone, I just started learning Elm, and I have been looking at parent child communication
U66RFDZ8F : this is kinda troubling
U66RFDZ8F : What I find is not appealing
U66RFDZ8F : I have looked at <https://medium.com/@alex.lew/the-translator-pattern-a-model-for-child-to-parent-communication-in-elm-f4bfaa1d3f98> and <https://github.com/evancz/elm-sortable-table> for inspiration and I still think there's a gap
U66RFDZ8F : From what I saw, I came up with this <https://gist.github.com/thedumbtechguy/b930cfe1f066e24bc266d6b9d1eac059>
