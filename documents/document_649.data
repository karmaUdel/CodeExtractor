```
these are two python packages. requests has been cloned down from github but i would like to edit it separately and see the changes in `my_awesome_app`
i would go into the `my_awesome_app` dir and activate the virtualenv.
then type `pip install -e "../requests"`
virtualenv?
uuuh let me see if I can figure something out by cloning the repo
yes, a virtualenv is short for “virtual environment” it basically makes a copy of your python binaries and places them in a separate location (again using symlinks). This separate location acts as an isolated environment in which you install dependencies/packages. What you gain from this is the ability to only have the packages and package versions you need for that particular project.
if you are using python3 it comes with virtualenv capabillity
does `pip install` look for any particular file?
pip install will be looking for a `setup.py` file in the root of the package.
great
I think I got this
:thumbsup:
it takes a bit to get used to. virtualenvs, pip, and so forth but once you get the process down it will be second nature.
and once you start working with multiple projects with different requirements/dependencies and even python versions you'll see why this extra stuff exists.
hey it worked!
the important thing is to try and start using these practices early on so that they become habit as they are typically used by python developers.
it actually really works!
this is going to be my first pull request
thank you so much <@U0NRYQNAZ>
that's fantastic. i'm glad i could help.
Does anyone have a pro tip for freeing up disk space on a SSD?
links
`rm -rf /`
BleachBit
and ZFS
(compression is freeing space, right?)
Depends on what OS, but on mac there is a diskutility thing that is used to erase free space, I have seen that reclaim a bit. Also cleaning up a docker cache, if you use docker
I want to use setattr inside a class's init method. Should I use it on `self` or `self.__dict__` ?
but it WAS JUST WORKING. I didn't change any code just came home from school. I found that the interpreter was no longer set to python 3.6, it wasn't set to anything so I'm wondering if other things may have changed? Thanks for any help! I'm hoping it is a commonly known problem if something is just working and then starts to give you this error if you come one and off wifi or something. Another one of my projects happens to be having the same problem. I also tried typing /admin or /queue_system after the web address too. Neither worked.
