Thanks for taking a look <@U1BP42MRS> :taco:
Yeah it's a little awkward, but at the end I meant to print `cache.values()` 
That works great, when the data gets too large I'll adjust as necessary.
Good call on not pre-optimizing too much! I am sure there is some really terse and cool trick, but I like simple :smile:
Get the loader memory for each machine ?Is there any good way?
question for anyone who uses pyenv — should the `.python-version` file be commited to vcs, or is it considered good practise to ignore this file?
<@U6B8B09JT> ignore, of course
That's an environmental detail
How can I send the value of a variable in endpoints api to _post_put_hook function in python ?
can anyone help ?
I'm sure someone can help but you'll need to post more details :slightly_smiling_face:
I am using google cloud endpoints along with ndb datastore .
I am setting values in my request class parameters
can then I put these data in ndb
my api know the value of the variable
but right after I put
_post_put_hook function is called
but it does not know the value of that variable
Sorry I have never used google could endpoints so I can't really help you :confused:
<@U3T76H0JW> can you post a snippet of your code ?
so i started using fantastical and i really like it but want to integrate other services. they didn't make this very easy =(. to parse text outside of fantastical it says to type this: `<x-fantastical2://parse?s=Sentence> goes here` i tried this in a browser to no avail. does anyone know where i can type this sort of thing into osx?
i've tried spotlight but that didn't work either.
Anyone have a simple to use GUI?
HTML?
desktop?
tkinter, I'd say
Yeah desktop, and I saw tkinter, might have to go with that
has anyone worked with crucible/fish eye before?
I've used crucible before
was ok
why?
Basically grabbing analytics from it for peer reviews and then essentially updating a CSV with new data of progress of peer reviews
So I gotta use their API, hoping I can get the data I need
not sure this will work but if you used a jupyter notebook they would have something essentially like a gui. they could run your code and get ouput and it be relatively easy.
Uh oh, management wants insights... huh?
Haha, well they already get insights. It just gets tedious for the guys to hand type in all the updated info for each week for the last 12 weeks
and it has to be redone each time cause each week the analytics change of course for the weeks before also so they can spend an hour updating the thing
When python can do it in a few seconds :slightly_smiling_face:
checkout a temp jupyter notebook here: <https://tmpnb.org/>
What is it exactly? <@U0NRYQNAZ> temporary server for running python?
jupyter is cool
&gt; The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.
Hmmm okay that might be really convenient
plus it can be put on github and look cool
Sort of like a prelim thing I can show them when I'm done and they can decide if they want a GUI or not
you might have to setup your own jupyterhub server but it is relatively easy to do. the jupyterhub server can be setup to require username and password.
then no one needs to install anything.
they simply go to your page: <http://jupyter.kbman.com|jupyter.kbman.com> and login
i have an ansible playbook if needed :wink:
more info here: <https://jupyter.org/>
Once I get this setup I'll definitely get that setup
if you are just looking to use basic jupyter, and you use pycharm you can start a new project, pip install jupyter then instead of making a .py file you can make a .ipynb file
since it is python the sky is the limit. if you want you can setup a way for the csv to be emailed to them or whatever.
the notebooks can also utilize `input` if you need the user to type in information.
so if you wanted to run a cli script inside the notebook and prompt them for their name, etc, you can do that.
That might actually be super convenient
Oh man this should be fun. The documentation for this API is leading me to 404 errors.
TIL ipython does input
<@U0NRYQNAZ> can you show live terminal output in there?
what do you mean live?
Say I run a long-running subprocess
hmmm... idk. i would have to try it. you can run pip commands and they scroll out. that's what is happening at the top.
Or can you only spawn one and print the data
Oh, I guess I didn't think about how they have the syntax to run straight shell commands
<@U0NRYQNAZ> :taco:
I totally spaced the `!shell command`
yea it's cool
i use jupyter notebook for one off things like this all the time.
very convenient
Yeah, I was thinking about adding a subdomain to my site so I can just have one centralized
i have an ansible playbook if you want to deploy jupyterhub.
you will have to pull all the the R things out of it.
one of my first projects where i work was setting up a jupyterhub with an R kernel and other packages.
Oh yeah, I love references
i'll try to test it later on to make sure it works. haha
okie
i have a vm i can run the playbook.
Would love to have it too. <@U1BP42MRS> one of pyslackers rôle? 
We can do that for sure, make it a community effort
I'll start on breaking those up tonight if I have time
:thumbsup: 
Do you still need help w/ this?
* but they decide to enforce that the host needs to be a domain name... so in my compose file I had to hack it with `<redis://redis.cache>`
hello, could someone help me with a flask issue i'm having?
Simply post your question in <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>
<@U6AFDVDA9> sure, post your question here (or <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>) and someone will answer when they can :slightly_smiling_face:
Please read the intro doc on suggestions, basically: post your question (rather than ask for permission).
:thumbsup: will do
thx
You got it!
