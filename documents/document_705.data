I know you can use a `with` block in some other test packages, but to be honest this seems like a weird thing to be testing for
You could probably use `self.assertIn("donation", item.__dict__)` or some similar abomination if you really want a one-liner
<@U5LNXQHN3> Yeah it sounds weird, but actually the object under test is some kind of container giving both attribute and keyed lookup access to a set of properties, and I need to test whether the right exceptions are thrown during lookup of a nonexistent property.
Sounds like a bad idea to me. But if I had to write tests for it, I'd just use the __dict__ check directly. Or `hasattr`.
<@U5LNXQHN3> Bad idea? You have a better idea? Thanks for the `hasattr` tip! This is what it's all about, the `Bunch` object: <https://github.com/motoom/bunch>
I think that is unnecessarily blurring the lines between a container and a type. If you don't know what attributes a type has, then you don't really know what interface it provides, which makes it a very awkward object to work with
