U3YDBDP4Z : Does Elm have default function parameter syntax?
U1ECWM37W : Nope
U0CK8CJ5D : Elm has automatic currying, so you can create functions with preset arguments. Maybe this fits your use case.
U3YDBDP4Z : Creating unit tests that involves the model can become a bit cumbersome when model has a lot of properties after a while
U0CK8CJ5D : You could provide a static default model then and use that to create more specialised ones.
U3YDBDP4Z : You mean creating new ones by updating the default one with the needed properties?
U3YDBDP4Z : That's an option :slightly_smiling_face:
U0CK8CJ5D : yes
U604S603Y : to call some function in my update function I need to create a let ... in ... block, don't I? But then I have to store the result of any function call in a value, even if I don't care for it?
U3SJEDR96 : <@U604S603Y> if you don't need the result of the function, why would you call it? Since it can't have side-effects, it won't really do anything, will it? :slightly_smiling_face:
U604S603Y : for example:```ChangeWindowTitle page -&gt;
            let
                pageInfo =
                    getPageInfo page

                _ =
                    Ports.changeWindowTitle pageInfo.baseTitle
            in
                ( model, Cmd.none )```

U3SJEDR96 : Oh, alright. So even that `Ports.changeWindowTitle : String -&gt; Cmd msg` function doesn't have a side effect; and doesn't actually change the window title. Rather, it returns a `Cmd` that describe to the runtime that it needs to call a function in JS
U3SJEDR96 : so you probably want `ChangeWindowTitle page -&gt; ( model, Parts.changeWindowTitle (getPageInfo page |&gt; .baseTitle) )` or something like that
U3SJEDR96 : the important part is that you must return that Cmd from your `update` to have it do anything
U64D26Q95 : Hi. Can anyone help me with decoding the following JSON:```
{
  "hotels": [ ... ],
  "deals": [ ... ]
}
```
into: ```List Hotel```
where:
```
type alias Hotel =
  { deals : List Deal }
```
, please?

U3SJEDR96 : so each deal is valid for each hotel? or..?
U3SJEDR96 : making a few assumptions here, but possibly something like this: <https://ellie-app.com/3FLMJtntJm8a1/0>
U0ULRASLC : <@U3SJEDR96> I love those fancy resorts with free toilet paper ;D
U3SJEDR96 : Don't we all?
U604S603Y : with the elm debugger (seems to be builtin?) running in Chrome -&gt; is there a way to look into the Message contents?
U0ULRASLC : if elm debugger is running you can just click on it and it will open a window with all the Messages and states
U0ULRASLC : the thing in the bottom right corner of the page
U3SJEDR96 : also, for quick-n-dirty msg logging, `case Debug.log "msg" msg of` in your `update` :wink:
U604S603Y : yeah but the Messages part of it is so small so I can't see the data, even when hovering over it
