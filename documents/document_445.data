right. And the function you give to `Array.foldr` takes an entry of the array you provide as input, as well as the value to accumulate into. For example `List.foldr (\x sum -&gt; sum + x) 0 (List.range 1 4)`
in your case, it seems like you may be providing a `Point -&gt; Array Row` function, but that's not something `foldr` can work with
Hmm... I'm trying to loop through an array of coordinates and return a new updated grid with each iteration...
[{x=1,y=2}, {x=2,y=2} ...] &lt;| forEach (\point -&gt; getUpdatedGrid point)
Maybe I just missed the accumulator..
hold up, I'm not sure I'm following. It feels like you want to transform each point in your grid, in which case you'd want a function `Point -&gt; Point` and use `Array.map`
