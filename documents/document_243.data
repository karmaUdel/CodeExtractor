U5SCZGNM9 : Im looking for recommendations for a cheap/simple/lightweight ticketing system in slack. 
I realize I can search the app directory, and look at reviews, feature lists, and pricing for each one.... But this could take hours... And I'm betting dozens of people here, already have done this and have well informed opinions on what ticket system/app might be best for my priorities.   Lightweight, cheap, super easy to make tickets, and have chats tied to tickets. Don't need a ton of features beyond that.... might get 1-5 tickets a day on average.  

I appriciate any suggestions!

U16RE1JLF : zerocool: my company happens to do just that!  We're in private beta right now, but I'd love to hear about your use case and can send you a demo video and invite.  don't want to be spammy in <#C04SM6TAK|general>, but if you (or anyone) wants to DM a followup I'll shoot you the deets.
U5SL9NDRB : Hi, does anyone know of a easy way to grab a user's information (like first or full name) with only a slash command?
U07CW6N3A : <@U5SL9NDRB> you'd need to use the web API in conjunction with your slash command to retrieve that kind of extended information. Most commonly, folks either have a bot user and use that token, or you ask for the `users:read` scope and use the user token you receive during installation to occasionally poll `users.list` and keep the maps in memory OR look up on demand by user ID with `<http://users.info|users.info>`.
U5SL9NDRB : Yeah, I was trying to do that as well but I keep messing up somewhere and everything is always undefined. I don't suppose you know of a readily available example of such an API call?
U272P5K71 : <@U5SL9NDRB> In Python:```
from slackclient import SlackClient

slack_token = "YOUR_BOTS_OAUTH_TOKEN"
sc = SlackClient(slack_token)

sc.api_call(
  user="U1234567890",
)
```

U5SL9NDRB : Thanks, that might help, using JS but should point me in the right direction.
U4T0WR6EM : ```// Inside a controller hears method 

<http://bot.api.users.info|bot.api.users.info>({ user: message.user }, (err,response) =&gt; {

});
```

U5SR6P42Y : hi everyone. is this community for AI in general? Or for some specific field?
U5TGL1Q78 : hi can someone help me sending a message ,with messagae-buttons using python/
U5M16RYPN : Guys how to implement "Sign in with Slack" and "Add to slack" with bot kit. Looks like Botkit only takes one set of scopes.

U0V93GE5R : ask away!
U5SF2SYHW : hi guys this is kingshuk
U5SF2SYHW : i need help in one issue
U5SF2SYHW : i am getting duplicate responses from messenger bot
U5SS5GK36 : <@U0V93GE5R> are you here ? :slightly_smiling_face:
U1DM2B4SY : <@U5SS5GK36> you didn't ask anything.....
U04S3JCH2 : <@U5SS5GK36> we are always here :smile:
U5SS5GK36 : I posted an issue on the github of botkit :slightly_smiling_face:
U5SS5GK36 : "Thanks for your response
I think you did not understand my problem :c
The problem is that I have someone type for example '!command' and the bot should respond 'I catch the command !' (so far so good) but what I want is then get the bot message info (like timestamp, etc) so I can edit this message when someone else type '!edit' for example :slightly_smiling_face:
 
I have to do it by code :slightly_smiling_face:
I know that I can use bot.api.chat.update(...) but I need timestamp, so how to get the message info from the bot reply ?"

U5SS5GK36 : <@U04S3JCH2> <@U1DM2B4SY> <@U0V93GE5R> :slightly_smiling_face:
U5SS5GK36 : (botkit)
U04S3JCH2 : <@U5SS5GK36> caught up with work right now but you should scan the <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> channel and post your question in there :thumbsup:
U5SL276PK : Hey all! Looking for some help and can't find anything online. I want to use api/files.upload to upload a file to our team channel and having issues with the multipart/form-data request. If anyone has any experience with this please send me a message or let me know.
U5SS5GK36 : I do not know that a botkit channel existed
U5SS5GK36 : thanks ! :slightly_smiling_face:
U4MSZ8FKN : Hey guys! I'm the Founder and CEO of StdLib, I've been here for a bit and tracked some convos. We launched a really easy way to build Slack bots a couple months ago.

U272P5K71 : meriann: this might be a good start<https://github.com/slackapi/python-slack-events-api/tree/master/example>

U0V93GE5R : <@U49NW26L9> please dont crosspost <#C0JQ4TX7Z|announcements> so liberally, or keep big walls of text to a thread.
U5SQTEC64 : Thanks 
U1WGDEYNA : Is it possible to disable interactive message buttons for certain users?
U5THQTFT9 : Hi, I've imported the botkit-starter-ciscospark to glitch. I've added the access_token and the public_address in the env file. I got the public_address from ngrok which is running on local machine. There are no errors on glitch. I see `POST /ciscospark/receive 502 Bad Gateway` on ngrok window. What am I missing? The bot is not replying to "hello".
U0V93GE5R : did you add the secret to the .env file?
U0V93GE5R : its a random string you make up
U0V93GE5R : fwiw we also have <#C2DR1AJD7|cisco_spark> here
U51B54SHX : Hi guys, has anyone built a bot on the Microsoft Bot Framework, ideally connected to Skype for Business or Facebook @ Workplace?
U5THQTFT9 : <@U0V93GE5R> Yes. On glitch, I'm using the access_token which I used in a non-botkit bot which I ran on my local machine following a cisco learning labs lab. That bot is now offline. Should I use the access_token of a newly created bot?
U0V93GE5R : yes, and you ALSO need to create a secret token
U0V93GE5R : i think you can reuse that old token
U0V93GE5R : mgtheboss: you might want to  regenerate the token or create a new app in the cisco developer portal if you are unsure if the old one still works
U5THQTFT9 : I also see 3 errors, `'matches' is not defined` in `skills/help.js`.
U0V93GE5R : thats unrelated to the token issue
U5THQTFT9 : In glitch log, I see `Cisco Spark: My identity is { id: REDACTED,8:46 PM
  emails: [ REDACTED ],
8:46 PM
  displayName: REDACTED,
8:46 PM
  avatar: REDACTED,
8:46 PM
  orgId: REDACTED,
8:46 PM
  created: REDACTED,
8:46 PM
  type: 'bot' }`. The emails and displayName fields contain correct values. Is token really the issue?

U5THQTFT9 : I tested with a new access_token. It didn't work. I removed and readded the bot in cisco spark. The two actions generated two more `502 Bad Gateway` errors in ngrok.
U5THQTFT9 : I tested with a new bot's access_token. It didn't work. I got `502 Bad Gateway` error when I added the new bot in cisco spark.
U5V5XAZRD : hey
U5V5XAZRD : how to use delayed response with botkit?
U5V5XAZRD : need for slash command
U0V93GE5R : And you entered the access token AND added the secret token that you made up?
U5U969G1G : Hey Bot Developer Hangout community, we're looking for people to _try our app and give us feedback!_ Lighthouse is a *complete security solution for Slack administrators* and we need to know what you think about it.
Feel free to comment on this post or send me a direct message.

<https://lighthousebot.com>

U04SM6T2H : <@U5U969G1G> congrats and everything, but if you could please keep announcements like this in <#C0JQ4TX7Z|announcements>
U04SM6T2H : we'd appreciate it!
U5U969G1G : benbrown: sure will do next time thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
U5THQTFT9 : Yes. In addition to during addition and removal of the bot, I am also getting the bad gateway message when doing @botname hello or @botname help.
U5THQTFT9 : Do I need to put the strings in double quotes in the env file?
U49NW26L9 : Hi mgtheboss:  i hope you have solved your issue :slightly_smiling_face: , but, in view of the technical nature of the issue, I would say it's worth to take a look on <https://machinabot.com> , let me know what you think...
U5THQTFT9 : It seems to be a tunneling issue. I've ditched glitch and now I'm running the bot on local machine. I'm getting a tunneling error when I'm visiting the ngrok https address.
Failed to complete tunnel connection

The connection to REDACTED was successfully tunneled to your ngrok client, but the client failed to establish a connection to the local address localhost:8080.

Make sure that a web service is running on localhost:8080 and that it is a valid address.

The error encountered was: dial tcp [::1]:8080: connectex: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.

U5THQTFT9 : Using `ngrok http 3000` instead of `ngrok http 80` seems to have taken care of the tunneling issue but, the bot is still not replying. I'm not getting the bad gateway messages anymore.
U5THQTFT9 : It seems I have solved the last piece of the puzzle. I was not providing the secret while creating the webhooks. I've got the welcome message, "I am a bot, here to do your bidding." I would like to know why it was not working with port 80. The `node-sparkbot-samples` from learning labs ran perfectly with port 80.
U5T2F9Z4M : Hello, I have installed and am using the botkit-starter-slack, everything is up and running but onboarding does not seem to work at least not my own thread, it only responds Welcome, &lt;user&gt;. Tried with creating an Onboarding1 in the botkitstudio and set it in the components/onboarding.js but it does not trigger by that call.
U5T2F9Z4M : It does not seem to be called in the console in studio. Any idea someone?
U5T2F9Z4M : I can imagine, some ppl are sleeping right now :slightly_smiling_face: I fly away and hope there will be a reply sooner or later *flies*
U5T2F9Z4M : I found out you will need to fix that yourself in the botkit-starter-slack/skills/sample_events, nevermind. Now I really fly away for a time being. But I would like to really thank Ben and his company for this great bot, it works splendid
U2CCKNCLR : I cannot use websockets anymore, does anyone know why?
U5V0QNDNK : Hey, about the `im_open` bot event. Isn't it supposed to fire when a DM chat is opened with the bot? (as in when a user opens the dm chat view) Nothing happens when I do this, even though I subscribe to the event.
*From the docs:* The `im_open` event is sent to all connections for a user when a direct message channel is opened by that user.

The permission scope of `im:read` is included.

U0GGT8K88 : Hey everyone! Our slack bot's on ProductHunt front page today and trending :slightly_smiling_face: Please do stop by and I look forward to answering questions! <https://www.producthunt.com/posts/senseihub>

U5VC60XE0 : Hey everybody! Do you have some ressources about learning how to use Botkit's NodeJS SDK? I mean except the official documentation?
U0V93GE5R : that is the best resource at the moment, but feel free to ask any advanced questions on the github or over in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit>
U5SS5GK36 : Its seems that nobody is responding in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> lol
U5N5BBML5 : Hi, how can I prevent my Bot from showing up under "DIRECT MESSAGES"? I just want the team to use the bot's slash command and not show the bot as a bot user

U5VGL6UM8 : hi all, I'm a beginner looking to learn more
U5VGL6UM8 : are bots able to access chat data - either in messenger or on slack?
U5URZ4FL0 : I also have the same question, can we access the chat data?
U5VGL6UM8 : (i mean, beyond the user's chat with the bot fyi)
U0V93GE5R : It depends on the permissions of the bot and where the conversations take place. 
U5VLUHP8C : hello,I am facing an issue in creating a bot in python-flask.
The function prints twice the required output.
Eg. if i want to print "Hello", it prints -
Hello
Hello

U5VLUHP8C : How to overcome this bug in my bot program?
U5N5BBML5 : Hi, how can I prevent my Bot from showing up under "DIRECT MESSAGES" after installation? I just want the team to use the bot's slash command and not show the bot as a bot user
U5WK01H71 : I am a beginner and I followed the differents docs files but I can't connect cisco-spark starter pack with my bot. Does anyone have some time to teach me ?
U04S3JCH2 : <@U5WK01H71> hey there! I can help you out. join the <#C2DR1AJD7|cisco_spark> channel and DM me :slightly_smiling_face:
U5DAC2Z4P : Hi, does anybody know which graphics library is used by statsbot. <@U0GRGF85N> ?
U5WL6GGNP : Any bot creator/developer from Canada here? I'm looking to make a bot for the airline and fintech industry. Hit me up, let's chat
U5V5XAZRD : why my slack messages encoding? e.g. Let's Validate became Let%27s Validate
U5MFBSY1Y : Awesome work <@U5VFAL5DY> and <http://UXDesign.cc|UXDesign.cc> team. I agree that chatbots currently lack proper human escalation protocols. 
U5URZ4FL0 : Hello everyone, when I tried to make the connection via slack_client.rtm_connect()  it always returned “False”. Does anybody know how to deal with this?
U5YAHQ1CP : <@U5URZ4FL0> - mine is now doing the same thing after rebuilding my docker app...
U5YAHQ1CP : guess if anybody has any solutions pass it along! slack status is saying everything is good... think that is a big fat lie.
U1NU1BA2W : added an integration to this channel: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/services/B5YE29PP0|Carla>
U1NU1BA2W : hello
U1NU1BA2W : removed an integration from this channel: <https://dev4slack.slack.com/services/B5YE29PP0|Carla>
U5YF8SWR5 : Hi - 
I created a bot for my team and my requirement is to update (apply basic formatting) every message posted by a user on a specified channel. To achieve this, I created Slack App and associated a bot with it. 

Then - I specified permissions - chat:write:user along with few other permissions to the App and generated Access Tokens for Bot and App after installing App to team.

Everything works fine when I (as owner of team) post a message as it gets updated using slack.chat.update API.

But - messages from other users are not being updated by the API and I get below error - Error: cant_update_message

Could someone please help me on this.

thanks.

U5XQCRDHT : Hi I am looking for anyone who was able to get carousels working?
U4HG47ZGD : itsmejainh: you can't update other people's messages with a bot. see <https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.update>
U5X3FESKB : <@U5YF8SWR5> Hi, that is possible can you try to add other permissions `channels:write` , `chat:write:bot`.
U5YF8SWR5 : I added those permissions and then I am able to edit my own messages
U5X3FESKB : <@U3RAA8WSJ> rewind
U3RAA8WSJ : Great... let me process your channel.
U3RAA8WSJ : Rewind complete for <#C04SM6TAK>. 500 links processed.See below two of the best items I found. For the complete list, <https://web.paperbot.ai/?utm_source=slack&amp;utm_medium=messaging&amp;utm_campaign=rewind | click here>.

U0Y7H2F3M : <@U3S6WLUM7> you should not install your bot in <#C04SM6TAK|general>  and also your bot <@U3RAA8WSJ>  is DMing all the members of this community for sign ups. Which is strictly not allowed. 
U0Y7H2F3M : <@U0V93GE5R> , <@U04SM6T2H> please take appropriate action. 
U5YF8SWR5 : But I want is - capability to edit all messages posted by anyone with some formatting
U0V93GE5R : <@U0Y7H2F3M> thanks for that report
U4T0WR6EM : Hey Ya'll, does anyone use redux in there chatbots?
U5Z90S4JJ : Curious. There's a 500 API limit even for hosting it on own server?
U5ZB04FN3 : hi. i'm having some trouble wrapping my head around botkit and the slack api. i'm having a bit of a "drinking from a firehose" feeling. there seem to be a bunch of different methods of authentication, of communicating with the slack api, etc. does anybody have any advice? i'm trying to figure out what's the absolute bare minimum i need to get a bot up and able to read and write from a channel but am not having much success.
U5XQCRDHT : hi guys. i'm trying to write a chatbot that's asking for email, phone number, age, etc. do you have any idea how could i build the conversational flow so that if someone replies with an invalid email address, the chatbot would ask them to type a valid email address. after they retyped the email and it was validated, the chatbot should go to the next question?
U4HG47ZGD : drguildo: did you start with the Slack starter kit?
U4HG47ZGD : you can start super easily here: <https://glitch.com/~botkit-slack>
U4HG47ZGD : anam1: check out the conversation docs: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/readme.md#conversation-threads>. at a high level - sounds like you should have one `thread` that ask the core questions - email, phone, age, etc. then you should have another thread for the case of an incorrect email (use regex to check) that you can jump to and ask for the correct email, and jump back once you have it
U5XQCRDHT : <@U4HG47ZGD> thanks
U04S3JCH2 : I also made a video walkthrough for that you might enjoy: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us2zdf0vRz0>
U5XGEA3TM : Random question - has anyone had a lot of problems with Facebooks account system if you've only set one up to access their Developer Platform?
U5XGEA3TM : I'm getting so much grief about "suspicious activity"
U5ZB04FN3 : thanks but how is a project with 20+ files super simple?
U5ZB04FN3 : i managed to take a machete to some example code and it turns out you only really need about 4 lines of code to get a slack bot connected and processing events
U5ZB04FN3 : but all the code and documentation i've looked at overcomplicate things
U4HG47ZGD : there's a lot going on but really the /skills folder is all you need to look at to start out. slack just has a bunch of different ways to process events.
U3FGRUSLT : having fun writing this macOS app <https://higher.team/blog/2017/june/native-macos-slack-client-not-electron> any alpha testers out there?
U4BAQAQ1G : do anyone know here how to integrate Telegram with Slack : I have a group in telegram and I want send &amp; receive msgs from Slack Channel
U5YC8NBKN : do anyone know how I can join a real user to any channel through nodejs?
U5YC8NBKN : I am new to  slackbot
U4HG47ZGD : salimhurjuk: i dont think botkit has telegram support yet, but you could start with a Slack bot in Botkit and send/receive requests via the Telegram api, or even write Botkit middleware for telegram :slightly_smiling_face:
U0Z1RH1QX : you can also use botkit studio for this, it's a very simple flow and you will need to write only very little code
U0Z1RH1QX : azizimranz: you want to invite a real user to a channel in slack, is that what you mean? use the channels.invite method <https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.invite>
U5YC8NBKN : Thanks for the reply Vikyan.
U605K32CE : hi everybody! :slightly_smiling_face:
U5XL3U90T : hey there :slightly_smiling_face:
U0DBP0CBF : Is there a standard way to direct message a large list of users in a team? When I try to loop through them and startConversation, I get a `Callback was already called.` error.
U5V5XAZRD : how to separate slack app from production and development? need to test app before deployment
U0GT29N3A : bakhtiyor: I think most of us actually have 2 different apps for that purpose
U0KECURAT : Yep, me too. Sometimes more even, for seperate devs and staging too
U5V5XAZRD : yeah, i created "fake" apps, but wanted your experiences
U5V5XAZRD : thanks
U5V5XAZRD : anyone know encoding message issue in slack?when i sent `Ooops, something went wrong!`, it displays `Ooops, something went wrong%21`, `%21`

how to resolve it?

U4Y8PNP6V : same thing here, separate apps for each dev and staging.  Pretty easy to manage once all set up.  Only issue we ran into was sharing slash cmds in the same team.
U0D7F12ER : We have a separate Slack team up and running that we use to test apps in a dev environment.
U2ST09C5V : I created a basic FAQ bot for my company. when I tried to include in our slack group. it is working only if add it to channel. Can i make it not include in channel so users can post directly to slackbot
U5Z88QDQ9 : <@U2ST09C5V> the slack bot i did was an outgoing webhook and it only saw messages that started with the bot's keyword… is that what you're looking for? (I didn't actually test across channels that i recall)
U5V5XAZRD : <@U4Y8PNP6V> for sharing slash cmds, i put some "namespaces", e.g. `/analyze`, `/analyze:dev`, `/analyze:staging`
U3TKE6SJ2 : Hi Everyone, Is there any open source Bot framework available that support  web chat like a Drift?

U5URZ4FL0 : You mean like web-based real-time message framework?
U0V93GE5R : neel: posted a reply over in <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit>
U4T0WR6EM : Hey! I'm wondering if its a good idea to be able to pass in a tickInterval as config?
U612HSHME : Does anyone have documentation on how to make message buttons (not message menus) for a bot that isn't an app
U4HG47ZGD : trfylh: why not just make it an app
U612HSHME : Doing it for an internal company thing, don't have a choice unfortunately :disappointed:
U0D7F12ER : My understanding is only an app can respond to interactive messages
U0D7F12ER : Also, in case it helps for an internal thing: apps can be private — don't have to list them in the directory.
U4HG47ZGD : ^ what <@U0D7F12ER> said! just make it a private app
U0D7F12ER : We use private apps as our primary method of distribution. Everything runs via a bot, but because we're enabling our customers to talk to _their_ customers, we need the bot to be branded according to the company (vs. a bot named after us).
U612HSHME : Thank you!
U4BAQAQ1G : Unable to verify url while creating slack app
U6215EHFV : Hi all
U6215EHFV : Can we create a bot to talk to another bot in Facebook Workplace ? Is there any sample code I can refer?
U0V93GE5R : ezree: will respond over in <#C11Q41CR3|fb-messenger>
U4E6DDG6L : Hi there.  Is there a detailed step by step code tutorial on setting up OAUTH for Slack apps for a non-developer?
U04SM6T2H : <@U4E6DDG6L> you can use our prebuilt boilerplate app that uses oauth. we have docs for setting it all up.
U04SM6T2H : I will DM you some links
U4E6DDG6L : Please sir.
U62H7MAG2 : What's the best way to scale a bot that connects to multiple teams across several servers?
U62H7MAG2 : e.g. Let's say I'm connecting to 1000 Slack teams using websockets. I need to spread that load to a max of 100/server (hypothetical)
U62H7MAG2 : How can I ensure that each of the 10 servers is connecting to the right teams without duplication?
U62KZ4F6G : you'd probably want to set up some kind of microservice that can track all 1000 servers and distribute them 100 at a time as they're requested
U62KZ4F6G : something with express would be easy ish
U62KZ4F6G : the main problem you might have is determining when a server has gone down (for restarts or whatever) -- possibly could have each server re-validate their connection to the microservice every 5m or so
U614KR11A : <@U62H7MAG2> That seems like a case serverless ! (<http://serverless.com>) I'm currently working around with it, and it's what I'd use, coupled with either dynamoDB or Google Cloud Datastore depending on the needs and mood of the day
U3NFQN97H : anyone know what are the other values of “attachment_type”? I've only seen “default” on slack documentation pages (<https://api.slack.com/docs/interactive-message-field-guide>, <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-buttons>)
U62PRPLPN : Has anyone done authenticated app unfurls? There is an option to send a user_auth_required to get the user to authenticate. But looks like it still required a token for the request. Since the user hasn't authenticated yet, which token do you use? I'm guessing I have to keep track of the token of the first user who authenticated the app and use that here?

U500C4E05 : <https://dev4slack.slack.com/archives/C04SX7RLD/p1498968698632805>^Just gonna post it here instead of spamming too many channels looking for answers.

U6330SLE9 : Hello Everyone,while performing Slack event on slack bot my message(response) is been duplicate at Slack bot.
While debugging I check this URL
<https://api.slack.com/events-api> Please check "Responding to Events" in it.
Is it true we have to response in 3 secs?
is it possible to increase the response time?
Any suggestion to avoid this?
Best
Mahendra S Chouhan

U0V93GE5R : <@U62EJPRUH> No bots in general please 
U5SQTEC64 : Hello! I've run starterbot in PyCharm and everything was ok. But when I've written in command line"python starterbot.py", I got an import error " No module named slackclient". Why??
U62KATTL0 : <https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient/issues/183>
U54C2FV2L : <@U3NFQN97H>: There is no other value for now, It's a placeholder for future features
U54C2FV2L : <@U500C4E05>: to make it more complicated, also check out: <https://github.com/BeepBoopHQ/slapp>
U54C2FV2L : I personally don't like botkit's approach. You end up writing different bots for different platforms anyways. Go for somehting Slack specific and always uptodate with the API features. Will make your life easier from my experience.
U54C2FV2L : <@U6330SLE9>: yes that's true. You are expected to respond within 3 seconds.
U54C2FV2L : When your response requires some time to be processed (e.g. when generating a statistic) then reply immediately with a message that states that you are currently processing the request and update or respond to this messages when you have your result.
U54C2FV2L : When you are having trouble to respond within 3 seconds even when your use case is simple then you should look into why your performance is so bad. You should aim for 100ms response time for standard responses in production mode. When testing locally using tunnels you might run into this limit from time to time though. Just ignore it.
U500C4E05 : Thanks <@U54C2FV2L> that's exactly my concern, so far the `bot.api` in botkit seems to be handling that very nicely, so basically there is a 1-to-1 mapping with slack's API. However, I'll definitely look into slapp and see if a platform specific toolkit will be more flexible, because in the end I just want to create a Slack specific bot.
U54C2FV2L : happy that I could be of help :slightly_smiling_face:
U3NFQN97H : Thanks <@U54C2FV2L> :slightly_smiling_face:
U66575GER : Hello, I am not able to make an account on botkit website for quite a while, are you guys still up?
U4DU4NRL4 : <@U66575GER> <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit>
U4DU4NRL4 : this isn't only a botkit chat
U0V93GE5R : pavelescu.razvan: What error are you seeing specifically? We also have <#C4MJKM145|botkit_studio>
U3V18PH1V : hi guys. I'm running a slash command that calls an aws lambda function.  The command works just fine and responds with the correct info. THen slack immediately shows the error: “Darn – that slash command didn't work (error message: `502_service_error`).” …. Any ideas whats going wrong?
U4HG47ZGD : tennis: try adding `bot.replyAcknowledge();`
U4HG47ZGD : also this is probably better suited for <#C0AV5N8NA|botkit> and/or <#C0K8617D5|slack-api> :slightly_smiling_face:
U3V18PH1V : Thanks. Will do.
USLACKBOT : This message was deleted.
U5MCLC8SC : is this a slack bot or what service are you connecting to?
U69AVHSRL : It's a Slack Bot connecting using rtm.connect
U69AVHSRL : I'm getting a websocket error. However, if it doesn't connect it should just print my else statement, but it continues as if it connected.
U683VRKC2 : <@U69AVHSRL> what is RTM for reference?
U68GCNS4S : Hi everybody! I just make my robot with botkit, I have in my slack team already and I saw the event "onboarding" was trigger when I installed it. Now the problem is that I cannot trigger any other script, I've tried with the "hello" script and one that I made yesterday but nothing happend. Is there anything I did wrong? should I activate the events in the my API slack? Thanks for your attentions. Regards!
U68GCNS4S : well I answer myself, I have found that I miss some parameters like the bot needs to receive events and some other configurations, every other thing was OK. Here I found the answer for my question (video from howdy by the way): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us2zdf0vRz0>
U68FWJ3UG : Hi Guys,
U68FWJ3UG : i am kinda new to the bot building and AI, how ever trying my best to learn stuff as quickly as possible.
U68FWJ3UG : I need some help
U68FWJ3UG : i am tasked to build an enterprise chatbot that will communicate with a Qlik Sense and fetch requested data from it
U68FWJ3UG : i have gone through multiple tutorials and am more confused than ever..
U68FWJ3UG : these are the parts that i was able to figure out
U68FWJ3UG : - Natural Language Processing &amp; Understanding using <http://API.AI|API.AI>
U68FWJ3UG : - Building a Bot Using Microsoft Bot Framework with Node Js
U68FWJ3UG : - Integrating <http://API.Ai|API.Ai> with my botframework
U68FWJ3UG : how ever the tricky part is Qlik Sense uses a Websocket protocol for communicating with Qlik Engine.
U68FWJ3UG : Now i am super confused as to how do i map the intents and entities to the Websocket api's
U68FWJ3UG : Any help is much appreciated, thank you
U4T67EY1X : I'd recommend checking out a more specific channel to try to maximize the expertise of folks who see it: <#C63KSHE2C|bot-framework> is the channel for MS Bot Framework folks which could be a good spot to start
U0V93GE5R : <@U4T67EY1X> yep! there is a conversation over their now if people want to reply!
U0V93GE5R : whoops one sec
U0V93GE5R : the correct channel is actually: <#C0UUYSF1P|botbuilder>
U68FWJ3UG : <@U4T67EY1X>  Sure thank you
U68FWJ3UG : will do
U6734RZ9V : Hello guys where can I find good tutorials on building chat bots  with nodeJS
U4MSZ8FKN : Hey <@U6734RZ9V>; <https://medium.com/slack-developer-blog/build-a-serverless-slack-bot-in-9-minutes-with-node-js-and-stdlib-b993cfa15358>
U4MSZ8FKN : That's for Slack, specifically.
U6734RZ9V : Thanks <@U4MSZ8FKN> 
U055FHACC : I have a long JSON from Slack's message editor. What's a good way (for non-developers..) to see it rendered inside real Slack (desktop + mobile)? Neither Slack's message editor nor other tools (eg Walkie) are 100% accurate [case in point, I have tons of attachments and I want to test the optimal way to arrange them in one message]
thanks!

U685A0UG2 : Hey all, 100% new to bots. I want to relay messages between a slack channel and hangout/groupme. Can you point me in the right direction?
U07CW6N3A : your best bet will be some kind of middleground of using a browser-based tool like "Postman" or by using a console-based tool like `curl`.
For testing messages as vanilla as possible by just copying and pasting the JSON from message builder, I'd create an incoming webhook and then just send that JSON to the URL using curl like this:

`curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" INCOMING_WEBHOOK_URL --data "{ // all your JSON }"`

There's some easier/harder variants where you put the JSON in a file and reference it instead.

With something like postman, you'll have a field for a URL (your incoming webhook URL) and the ability to easily just say "I'm posting JSON" and copy and paste it into a box hit send and check out the result.

U67BAG2FN : Can you add scripts as treads in other scripts? Like can you import scripts to use as treads? I'm finding that I'm repeating myself a lot.
U67BAG2FN : I'm basically asking a yes or no question the yes will continue the tread, but no is a tread script that has the same choice: main menu and exit.So I'm looking for a way that I can reuse that script if it's possible.

U6A2R2RD3 : Hello everyone!
U4HG47ZGD : if you are using botkit studio if you wrap the script as a skill then you can `trigger` the script anytime using `controller.studio.runTrigger`
U4HG47ZGD : start with the slack bot starter kit! <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack>. easiest thing is to just get it setup with Glitch. then you'll have to look into the hangout/groupme apis those aren't supported by botkit yet so you could integrate with them directly or build some botkit middleware :slightly_smiling_face:
U51QR4Z29 : real time messahing
U5MCLC8SC : This is cool. Any experience/thoughts deploying the botkit for slack framework to stdlib?
U685A0UG2 : Thanks
U69GYPC4T : I just create one slack botchat using botkit. I congured everything but now i am stuck i could not run the application
U69GYPC4T : can any one help me how can I test my application
U69GYPC4T : Hi
U5MUBMZ99 : What alternatives to Botkit Studio do you use to manage messages etc. Just a normal admin backend with flask or node ? Sorry for a noob question, just trying to get my head around the best way to keeping a bot up to date, e.g. My bot projects sends reminders, motivation etc. So I need to be able to manage those easily
U6AS92AE9 : What's up fellow bot makers
U6AS92AE9 : I've a quick newbie question, regarding node.js bots
U6AS92AE9 : After conducting a api method how do i pass the output, of let's say the channel value to a variable?
U49QBG45P : Hey I have question to the Slack API for python, I am making a “chat.postMessage” call with the api_call() method, and I try to make a post of String, when I look in slack, the string is getting formatted, how can I avoid that? Thanks
U0V93GE5R : Just curious what is undesirable about using studio for this?
U055FHACC : Thanks, I ended up posting JSON from here with my token<https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage/test>

U5MUBMZ99 : I don't know the pricing yet and would like to plan longer term if this makes sense, I think botkit studio is great but I have no transparency over future costs 
U0V93GE5R : we are close to announcing pricing, let me send you a dm!
U4BAQAQ1G : Is it possible to get WhatsApp Grp msgs on Slack ?
U6C7DFR1D : hi
U6AKYCSM7 : hi
U6AKYCSM7 : can any one help me on'how can I manage a slack-bot with dynamic response using Ruby language

U6AKYCSM7 : I am new to slack-bot and ruby
U6AKYCSM7 : I have the following with me1. slack-bot
2. ruby installed

U6AKYCSM7 : i want a response from my bot if i ask anything to the bot
U4ZPQHVJR : Try send `help` to <@U3NTT2Z3K>
U4ZPQHVJR : You may find what you're looking for
U0V93GE5R : Welcome bot doesn't have much in the way of ruby specific info, sadly 
U5D8FNFCJ : <@U6BFN2S3X>
U0V93GE5R : just a friendly reminder: please dont run bots in <#C04SM6TAK|general>
U6AS92AE9 : <@U3NTT2Z3K> tell me how to output variables from a api method?
U6AS92AE9 : What type of bots are you guys working on?
U0V93GE5R : Welcome is a little more general than that. Try messaging it help for a list of topics 
U6AS92AE9 : I'm jkin
U6AS92AE9 : Fixed my problem anyways
U6AS92AE9 : anyone point me in the direction of making bots have user abilities like so -&gt; <@U3NTT2Z3K>
U0V93GE5R : that bot is made with botkit studio! using very little botkit code
U0V93GE5R : <https://studio.botkit.ai/login>
U6AS92AE9 : but actual using api methods?
U6AS92AE9 : or rtm client
U0V93GE5R : It's built using events api. Using studio will give you access to deploying a starter kit on glitch or heroku, or you can host it yourself. Welcome bot is powered by glitch!
U6B4VTHNC : Can someone help us get Botkit hooked up to Spark through Heroic deployment?
U4T0WR6EM : Hi Ya'll, I gave a talk at BrooklynJS last night about chatbots. Peep my slides - <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AGFl4n_bpdYJLvjceJzYUMSJ1dxMYqbqkH1WG69ALN0/edit?usp=sharing>
U4T0WR6EM : Also I created a demo repo that documents setup steps for slack apps/botkit. And shows an example of a bot that uploads files to github gists
<https://github.com/thoughtis/gistbot>

U4T0WR6EM : <@U0V93GE5R> I might try and create a PR for this re: <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/767>

U0LKH699P : anyone know how to close the browser window and come back to slack?
U0LKH699P : i'm doing an app that opens the browser (on mobile, its an OK embedded browser) to do a speech recognition task.
U0LKH699P : I want to close the browser and come back to the chat window…
U0LKH699P : window.close() and history.back() both do not work
U0LKH699P : ie if you send a link in a chat then the browser would launch
U0LKH699P : <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webview/close>
U0LKH699P : equivalent to ^
U0LKH699P : I guess slack doesn't really have ‘integrated' webview experience.
U0LKH699P : is there any other way to capture audio input than opening the browser?
U6AS92AE9 : Anyone building a tipbot here :slightly_smiling_face:
U6AS92AE9 : I am nearly done with it also!
U6AS92AE9 : Node.js and ruby
U6AS92AE9 : Lol talk about an 'active' slack
U6CEX8A3G : <@U6BK0H0U8> is that .env local or hosted on glitch?
U6CEX8A3G : i know for heroku you update the environmental variables via the CLI not a file in the repo
U6BK0H0U8 : thanks to <@U04SM6T2H> my problems solved
U6BQH8RL1 : Anyone knows how to keep a pair TITTLE : VALUE in the same line using 'attachments '
U4U6P9L1M : Hey, if I make requests from my botkit bot to other servers and want to get a log of such interactions, the best thing is to log my express server, right? 
However, I didn't feel the need to set up express for the bot since botkit /corebot already uses express. 

Can I log express server requests using winston without setting up express for this specific bot?

U4U6P9L1M : Seems to me <https://github.com/bithavoc/express-winston> I kinda have to
U4U6P9L1M : at least according to that
U6CM2KWR2 : Hey guys, anyone have an example of how to attach an interactive button using sc_api_call
U6CM2KWR2 : nvm figured it out
U4U6P9L1M : Is there a way to have good metrics/monitoring/logging without setting up express for my botkit application?
U6CUDPF29 : hey Guys. I want to explore Bots for FB messenger, anyone knows of a descent boiler plate bot Dev for Fb Messenger  ? thank you so much in advance!
U6CUDPF29 : boilerplate for FB messenger ;node.js/js if possible- thanks
U0V93GE5R : <https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-facebook> :wink:
U0XRM115M : ^ that one is really good.
U0V93GE5R : you can discuss it in <#C11Q41CR3|fb-messenger>
U6CUDPF29 : Awesome!! thank you so much guys!!
U6DTPT746 : Hi guys, I am trying to figure out how to make a simple mathbot using this: <https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md#env>
U6DTPT746 : But im having trouble, I would love some help
U6DTPT746 : Is the only connection to the bot when coding just the .env folder with only this in it: SLACK_API_TOKEN=xoxb-tokenstuffwhichiwontshowontheinternet
U66S6DE67 : Has anyone else stopped receiving event notifications from slack? Both bots, running on different servers as different apps, suddenly stopped receiving events
U0V93GE5R : slack is having trouble rn <https://status.slack.com/>
U5D3HQ6R0 : ^
U5D3HQ6R0 : ugh, right can't delete that
U66S6DE67 : Thanks! Bookmarked for future ref.
U0JAVM98A : Do you have more and more status code 500 when you do api call to slack?
U0JAVM98A : statuscode 500 returns a html webpage instead of a json object from cloudfront (or cloudflare, i don't remember)
U0V93GE5R : we have members of the slack team over in <#C0K8617D5|slack-api> btw
U6DTPT746 : anyone good at ruby, i need some help with a bot?
U6DTPT746 : detecting user input mostly
U6DC6MFFA : Hi All, we're looking into moving over to slackclient from Slacker for our Python apps.
U6DC6MFFA : Wondering if it has support for Python 3 yet... there seems to be some confusion about this.
U6DC6MFFA : Also, do we need to use a token or can we just rely on incoming webhook urls?
U6DC6MFFA : Thanks!
U0AFABJAJ : <@U6DTPT746> I can help. We can move this to the <#C0HUW58BC|language-ruby> channel
U6DTPT746 : ok im there
U0V93GE5R : <https://medium.com/@maelezzabdi/designing-a-chatbot-for-slack-lessons-learned-25edfe2c3a59>
U6DTPT746 : anyone know how to use ngrok and accept the challenge when requesting the url
U6270T8PJ : make sure your web app/server/whatever is running when you start ngrok, and point Slack at the URL that ngrok prints out as the `https` URL
U6270T8PJ : you should get the challenge just like Slack was connecting directly.
U67G5PYL9 : how am i able to get the bot object outside of a controller.hears type of event?  i saw one thread on github where someone says to `controller.spawn()` and assign that to a variable, but that doesn't appear to work.  really i am trying to get the app token, which is usually at `bot.config.bot.app_token`, but `controller.spawn().config` is empty
U4Y8PNP6V : If all you need is the `app_token` I would recommend fetching it out of storage. `controller.storage.teams.get(team_id)`.  That would get around the spawn issue.
U67G5PYL9 : thanks, having a look
U68SKUSNP : My Chatbot is based on AWS/Lambda with NodeJS and client is FB Messenger

When I try to test it


[10:58] 
Anyone else haveing same issue?. Tried deleting node modules and re-installed the libraries, no use

U3TM5QFKP : have you tried deleting your `package-lock` file and re-installing?
U3TM5QFKP : checked your `nodejs` version on your server?
U0V93GE5R : <https://wit.ai/blog/2017/07/27/sunsetting-stories>
U4U6P9L1M : I'm trying to get access logs for my bot <https://github.com/onaio/karma/blob/14-implement-logging/lib/Facebook.js#L64>
U4U6P9L1M : However, expressWinston only logs for routes defined after the logger has been instantiated.
U4U6P9L1M : Is there a way I can log requests for routes that were instantiated by botkit without copying the botkit routes and replicating logic that botkit provides?
U6330SLE9 : which is better RTM or Event API ?
U6DAU7PS6 : Depends on what you're planning to do
U0GT29N3A : Event API is much easier and RTM a bit more powerful.
U4U6P9L1M : Am I asking the wrong question or is my code trash? I wonder why nobody here answers me.
U5D3HQ6R0 : there's not many people on in this time zone <@U4U6P9L1M> - some people are but perhaps those that can answer you aren't?
U4U6P9L1M : Oh that's encouraging
U4U6P9L1M : <@U5D3HQ6R0> :slightly_smiling_face: thanks
U4U6P9L1M : OK I found the solution from the FB botkit code. Instantiate the logger before the call to `createWebhookEndpoints`
U6330SLE9 : any tutorial for RTM and python ?
U6330SLE9 : Hi,Can anyone help in creating bot with RTM python?
Thanks in advance

U5PT28LP9 : <@U6330SLE9> <https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/build-first-slack-bot-python.html> is a little out of date but still looks like a decent tutorial.
U272P5K71 : Does it have to be RTM? Can you use the Events API? If so: <https://github.com/slackapi/python-slack-events-api/tree/master/example>
U6EMVS740 : Hi guys, I am developing a bot using RTM API, is it possible to connect and subscribe to certain channel only?
U0JAW1AS2 : Normally you receive only message from channel where the bot are. So you just have to get your bot into channels you wanted to subscribe.
U055FHACC : Can anyone recommend a good course for writers (script writer, copy..) who want to learn conversation design and writing for bots?Thanks!

U6DAU7PS6 : Guys, I'm trying to make an interactive menu with a button so user can choose an option from menu, then push the button and get the result. But I can't get how to do it, menu field clears right after I choose anything in it :disappointed: Can anyone help me? Maybe any live examples? I'm using Python.
U68SKUSNP : Hi AllMy use case is like, I send text message to user, with content_type as location.
So the user can specify the location using the map or he can manually type in the EIRCODE (Ireland's Postcode)
If the user enters text message for eircode, how can I identify the state associate the text message is for location identification)
I tried to attach metadata, but dont see it in the FB request

U60L0RQF4 : node-slack-interactive-messages anybody tried this
U60L0RQF4 : <https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-interactive-messages>
U60L0RQF4 : i am trying to add messages with buttons through hubot
U60L0RQF4 : <@U6DAU7PS6> tried <https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-interactive-messages>
U6DAU7PS6 : Yep, but I've tried it with Python language. It's pretty simple if you're not trying to do anything sophisticated.
U5FPB0C9G : I'm trying to deploy a hubot instance to cloud foundry but it's getting stuck after it writes `DEBUG Loading adapter slack` to log
U5FPB0C9G : any thoughts on what it could be
U5FPB0C9G : ?
U4U6P9L1M : Hey, has anyone here ran botkit with pm2 as the process manager and how did that go for them? It seems to start multiple processes (some sort of LB) and that makes continuing with a  conversation impossible.
U4U6P9L1M : or hard
U4U6P9L1M : hmmm I believe I have solved it by setting instances to 1 but I wish there was a way to make the pm2 process manager work something like a sticky load balancer.
U5629K709 : Hi all, it looks like Elm does not have lazy list processing.
Example code:

```
(List.take 3 (List.map f (List.repeat 10 1)))

f x =
  let _ = Debug.log "x" x
  in x
```

Output:

```
10 times x: 1
```

Why not?
Thanks

U3SJEDR96 : Elm is an eager language, not laziness unless explicitly introduced
U3SJEDR96 : That choice was made back when we still did FRP, but some of the reasoning still applies - <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/elm-discuss/9XxV9L0zoA0/cx3UMZ05Gc0J>
U5CGE1K16 : my version are elm 0.18.0, node 8.1.1, npm 5.0.3.  Yes, I can see the "update: DoSignUp" in the console as well.  But I was expecting the "Got the cmd" and data being passed around using the ports feature.  That is not happening when I press the sign up button in the Main.elm page.  Thanks again for the assist <@U0JFFPRHP>.
U5CGE1K16 : I'll try a simple ports example and play around with that.
U5GJ5FEAU : is there a quick way of getting the month number instead of the Month type, from a `Date.Date`
U4872964V : Introducing laziness in Elm would only lead to strange bugs where you'd have to introduce strictness functions at non-obvious places. Not so good for newcomers
U18S4094L : hardfire: the Date.Extra package will let you if you don't mind adding a dependency - <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justinmimbs/elm-date-extra/latest/Date-Extra>
U5GJ5FEAU : thanks <@U18S4094L> , i might do that if have another Date-ish requirement again. Right now I just did my own Month-&gt;Int function
U2SSNHFEJ : <@U48AEBJQ3> i dont see logged content in the command line. Debug.log is supposed to print in the browser console, but there is none for the npm runner
