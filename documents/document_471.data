U4872964V : yeah, well, Elm for native applications is not such a bad idea either
U5WS7CJLV : here here!
U5WS7CJLV : Elm :allthethings:
U653NCEEA : Is there some way of getting the message and status code behind `NetworkError`?
U4872964V : "means the user turned off their wifi, went in a cave, etc." :slightly_smiling_face:
U4872964V : status codes you can get from `BadStatus` error
U653NCEEA : Hehe, jupp…
U653NCEEA : Okay, so i would be able to get, to say, a 401 from `BadStatus`?
U4872964V : yes, the `Response` contains a `status` field with `code`and `message`:  <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/http/latest/Http#Response>
U653NCEEA : Perfect! Thanks a lot!
U4E8RTDPF : Hey, I have two Commands that I am batching.
```
Cmd.batch
  [ one
  , two
  ]
```

U4E8RTDPF : as I realized
U4E8RTDPF : this is not happening sequentially
U4E8RTDPF : how to make it sequential?
U4872964V : well, there are several answers to that, what are the commands more exactly and why do you want them sequentially?
U4E8RTDPF : <@U4872964V> they are http requests and one depends on another
U4872964V : <@U4E8RTDPF>, so, if they depend on each other then maybe you should send the other one after you get the result from the first one, in your update function
U3FJSB596 : <@U4E8RTDPF> How about Elm Core Tasks?<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Task>

U3FJSB596 : Combine several task into the same task and then make it into a command
U4872964V : Yes, if you have Tasks you can do that, but the Http module does not return Tasks
U3FJSB596 : Am I looking at the wrong package?<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-http/3.0.1/Http>

U3FJSB596 : It only return tasks
U4872964V : yes, <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0> is the current
U4E8RTDPF : <@U3FJSB596> it's old one.
U4E8RTDPF : <@U4872964V> yes you are right
U4E8RTDPF : I should do that in the update
U4E8RTDPF : but I was just curious if I was able to do something like cmd1 |&gt; andThen cmd2 thing...
U3WM55ZG8 : you can create tasks with elm-lang/http too
U3WM55ZG8 : <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/http/1.0.0/Http#toTask>
U3FJSB596 : At the very bottom of the module is `toTask` that explicitly says that it can be use for chaining requests
U4872964V : <@U3WM55ZG8> oh yes, you're right
U4872964V : then that's another option
U3FJSB596 : <@U4E8RTDPF> There's no chaining of Commands
U4E8RTDPF : `toTask` nice ! thanks <@U4872964V> <@U3FJSB596> :raised_hands:
U4872964V : i guess it depends on why one depend on the other
U4E8RTDPF : still, it's better to go with the update way..
U4872964V : which method is more suitable
U3LUC6SNS : Hi all.  I've made some changes (added a package) to my project, and now `elm-test` fails to run (the app compiles).  Here is the error message:```
jxxmbp:koko_client carlson$ elm-test
I cannot find module 'LatexParser.Latex'.

Module 'LatexParserTest' is trying to import it.

Potential problems could be:
  * Misspelled the module name
  * Need to add a source directory or new dependency to elm-package.json
```
I diffed the regular `elm-package.json` with the one in `tests`.  They are identical. So I am baffled.

U0FP80EKB : <@U3LUC6SNS> Do you need to have `..` in the src directories in `tests/elm-package.json`
U3LUC6SNS : In elm-tools parse is there a way to parse (and keep) everything from `\\[` to `\\]`?  I've been using code like```
arg =
    succeed identity
        |. symbol "{"
        |= keep zeroOrMore (\c -&gt; c /= '}')
        |. symbol "}"
```
but the boolean function takes a Char as argument, not a String.

U3LUC6SNS : <@U0FP80EKB> I tried that, but alas, it doesn't work. (same error message)
U0FP80EKB : Interesting. I think the src directories are relative pathed from the location of the elm-package.json, so I don't think they should be identical.
U0FP80EKB : Can you paste the source directories part?
U3LUC6SNS : Do you mean the elm-package.json?
U0FP80EKB : yeah
U3LUC6SNS : Here we go:```
