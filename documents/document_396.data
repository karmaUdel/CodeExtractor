```
where UnionType would be something like `type UnionType = A String | B | C`
<@U64FYS317> is very strange to name your constructors UnionType  - because a union Type by definition contains one or more constructors. But anyway - that will not work because you pass in `msg` to `subUpdate` and msg is of type `Msg` not of type `UnionType`
ah i see.
<@U2LAL86AY> It's just been adapted to a short example. Is there a way to hint at the compiler type that it IS necessarily a UnionType, considering it's already in that branch of the case statement?
yes but you need to do something like this
