U5U4MSHC1 : Yup.
U67NP4A0K : Could you try to answer me a question please?
U5U4MSHC1 : Yes if it is related to python.
U13L8J76J : <@U67NP4A0K> <https://mikeash.com/getting_answers.html>
U67NP4A0K : I'm currently learning how to use modules and call other files. It's is possible to have a file named(main.py) and call another file(ship.py). And from ship.py execute a function in main.py Sorry if I'm not explaining clear enough.
U67NP4A0K : From the function main.py I want to execute some code of the file ship.py and also I want to do it the other way, from ship.py I want to execute functions of main.py
U13L8J76J : <@U67NP4A0K> this is called a 'circular import', and that's generally prohibited
U67NP4A0K : Oh
U13L8J76J : `main.py` sounds like an entry point, why would you import something from it?
U67NP4A0K : I'll search about it
U65CTNMTR : ```# main.py
import ship
ship.some_function()

# ship.py
import main
main.some_other_function()
```

U67NP4A0K : Yeah malinoff, that was my idea, but at main.py I have a function to create a delay_print and I also want to use it at ship.py
U13L8J76J : <@U65CTNMTR> have you tried to run this snippet before posting? :slightly_smiling_face:
U65CTNMTR : as long as you don't do `from main import some_other_function` and `from ship import some_function` you won't have circular import issues. Although the import semantics have changed in Py3.x to help prevent circular imports
U67NP4A0K : <@U65CTNMTR>  Like this it gives me an error
U5U4MSHC1 : <@U67NP4A0K> Restructuring your code would help
U13L8J76J : <@U67NP4A0K> then move `delay_print` into `ship.py`
U13L8J76J : And do `from ship import delay_print`
U67NP4A0K : <@U13L8J76J> Yeah, that would work, and what about if I put this functions in another file and call them?
U13L8J76J : <@U67NP4A0K> you don't "call files" in python. You _import_ things from _modules_ and _packages_
U13L8J76J : <http://bit.ly/pypackages>
U67NP4A0K : Thanks to all, currently I'm a novice at Python and coding, and this is the first time I'm dividing my code in different files.
U67NP4A0K : <@U13L8J76J> oh, sorry. Thanks for everything :slightly_smiling_face:
U5NC85SCB : Just asked a Django related question in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> if anyone could help! :slightly_smiling_face:
U1BP42MRS : People there will see it, pointing it out isn't far off of cross posting. You only been to point it out if there's no action for a while 
U5NC85SCB : Alright, thought i'd posted the wrong place, apologies <@U1BP42MRS>
U1BP42MRS : It happens :)
U62MUG5L2 : Is any one aware of some API or some other way(free) to retrive DHL's courier tracking details for multiple users (input = user's tracking number) ?
U0NRYQNAZ : no but i remember when i wrote a fedex client that was SOAP. you may need to checkout their web api and create your own. if they provide a swagger file you may be able to autogenerate a client but that might be a stretch, hehe.
U62MUG5L2 : <@U0NRYQNAZ>  I think this is the link <http://www.dhl.com/en/parcel_ecommerce/integration/integration_channels/api.html> . But I haven't been able to figure out how to use it. I am working on chat bot using Microsoft's chat bot framework for DHL.
U0NRYQNAZ : yep that looks like it
U0NRYQNAZ : yea if you don't already see a python-dhl or dhlpy type of project on pypi you will need to write your own but this is good news. you should be able to integrate with dhl nicely with python :wink:
U0NRYQNAZ : we have lots of web apis at work so i'm always writing clients. their docs seem straightforward too.
U62MUG5L2 : <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dhl_shipping/2.0.4>
U62MUG5L2 : Yeah, I haven't worked on similar project before, so there are quite few things I need to figure out before development.
U6944D5GU : <@U5U4MSHC1>
U5U4MSHC1 : <@U6944D5GU> You got the gist?
U6944D5GU : yeah i dont understand how this code decide on 6
U6944D5GU : why not 1?
U6944D5GU : why does it only output one number
U5U4MSHC1 : Your function returns hcf, which is being overwritten everytime whenver hcf is set to i
U6829S5NZ : because hcf can hold only one number
U6944D5GU : but hcf is a name that we give it
U6829S5NZ : yes. try making HCF a list
U5U4MSHC1 : In first loop hcf is 1, next it gets overwritten with 2, next 3, next 6, hcf variable will continue to hold 6 until the loop hits 24
U6829S5NZ : it will give you all the numbers
U6944D5GU : how? what do you mean
U6944D5GU : oh!
U6944D5GU : understood :hugging_face:
U6944D5GU : :rose: i appreciate it
U5U4MSHC1 : We appreciate :taco: here
U6829S5NZ : just declare hcf=[] before the for loop
U6944D5GU : haha interesting i am coincidently listening to spanish music now :taco:
U6944D5GU : <@U5U4MSHC1> :taco:+1000000
U2BS4M1RV : You would also need to do hcf.append(i), can't just assign to it if you want it to remain a list.
U0NRYQNAZ : spanish music is awesome.
U5VGKQ2SY : As in from Spain or in Spanish? The former, maybe. The latter, I think it depends.
U67NP4A0K : <@U0NRYQNAZ> I'm from Spain, what singers are you talking about?
U0NRYQNAZ : latin america wherever.
U0NRYQNAZ : salsa, merengue, bachata, wutevs.
U69TZSJ7Q : pffff :joy:
U5UQKCC06 : I guess I could just do another list comp
U0NRYQNAZ : such judgement here
U5UQKCC06 : Well explain please
U0NRYQNAZ : oh o mean on my preferences in music. i
U5UQKCC06 : Oh ha, got ya
U5UQKCC06 : hi <@U699LSTHT>
U5UQKCC06 : I'm looking for a more pythonic way to achieve this:
U0PKTUWKH : Hi I need some help troubleshooting script that uses boto3
U0PKTUWKH : anyone familiar?
U1BP42MRS : Just throw out the question <@U0PKTUWKH> 
U0PKTUWKH : <@U1BP42MRS> that was bucket permission :see_no_evil::gun:
U1BP42MRS : Haha, happens all the time here too
U0PKTUWKH : is there a way to a use a wildcard in this statement?```
 print('Starting upload to S3')
    s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
    path = '/var/atlassian/application-data/jira/export'
    file_name = path + str(today) + '--0400.zip'
    s3_obj_name = str(today) + '--0400.zip'
    uploaded = s3.Bucket(bucket_name).upload_file(file_name, s3_obj_name)
    print('File' + " " + file_name + " " + 'has been uploaded')
    return uploaded
```
im looking to replace `--0400.zip` with some sort of wildcard if it is possible

U3T76H0JW : I am looking forward for help on decorators . I tried reading through several places on web but I could never get the essence of why do we use decorators in python ?
U3T76H0JW : Can someone over here take a lead and explain me  ?

U28MDQRL2 : Any good way to do a for loop where the first iteration value is different that the followings?. I'm trying to generate an unique username. Right now i have:```
        for add_to_the_last in range(10):
            if add_to_the_last == 0:
                add_to_the_last = ''

            username = f'{user.first_name} {user.last_initial}{add_to_the_last}'
            if not User.objects.filter(username=username).exist():
                break
```

It works but there must be a better way

U28MDQRL2 : well i actually forgot to add the username to the user.
U2UP91YLE : why are you doing that <@U28MDQRL2> ,testing or something else?
U5VGKQ2SY : Need some help w/ docker.When I run `docker images`:
```
REPOSITORY           TAG                  IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
<http://docker.io/nginx|docker.io/nginx>      stable-alpine        2d13ad575b6f        3 days ago          15.5 MB
```
First line in Dockerfile: `FROM nginx:stable-alpine`

When I `docker build -t linked-nginx .`, a new nginx latest is created.

U5VGKQ2SY : How do I build with nginx image that has already been pulled?
U2UP91YLE : `FROM <http://docker.io/nginx:stable-alpine|docker.io/nginx:stable-alpine>`
