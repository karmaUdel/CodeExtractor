U641LDZFU : so they could also be different-but-the-same
U2LAL86AY : oh
U2LAL86AY : no
U2LAL86AY : :))
U641LDZFU : I better get to bed, thanks again!!
U5R6L5MT4 : Hi
U5R6L5MT4 : At Elm Europe someone talked about compiling two Elm component at once to be able to load them after wards without compiling Elm twice
U5R6L5MT4 : I also had another question about loading the same elm component multiple times on the same page
U0LPMPL2U : Are you asking about compiling multiple files at once with `elm make File1.elm File2.elm` ?
U2LAL86AY : allan_x_anderson: I've simplified the data structure a bit. THis is just looking at what you have there,
As i sayed  -if i see a picture it will be much simpler to underestand if is what you need. Working only with what you have provided, this is the same thing:

U2LAL86AY : ```type Msg
    = NoOp


type alias Model =
    { player : Player }


type alias Player =
    { visitedStoryNodes : List Node, currentStoryNode : Maybe Node }


type alias Node =
    { id : Int
    , nodeType : String
    , state : Maybe String
    , transitions : List Transition
    , nodeContent : NodeContent
    }


type NodeContent
    = NewsItem { id : Int, content : List (Html Msg) }
    | ChatMessage { id : Int, content : List (Html Msg), chatId : Int, userId : Int }


type alias Transition =
    { transitionType : String, toStoryNode : Int, text : Maybe String }

```

U2LAL86AY : simplified: you don't have ChatNode and NewsNode - but instead you have a node - that can have different content.
and just this content inside is different.
this is why `nodeContent : NodeContent` can either be: 
`NewsItem` or `ChatMessage`
OK see you tomorrow :smile:

U5R6L5MT4 : <@U0LPMPL2U> is it all it takes? :flushed:
U0LPMPL2U : I think so?
U0LPMPL2U : checking `elm make --help`
U0LPMPL2U : ```elm make --help
elm-make 0.18 (Elm Platform 0.18.0)

Usage: elm-make [FILES...] [--output FILE] [--yes] [--report FORMAT] [--debug]
                [--warn] [--docs FILE] [--prepublish] [--prepublish-core]
  build Elm projects
```

U0LPMPL2U : That `[FILES...]` means you can put a list of file names
U5R6L5MT4 : <@U0LPMPL2U> it does works thanks
U2LAL86AY : does anyone seen this bug in `elmjutsu` where you try to rename a symbol - an the search tree appears 2 times for each symbol - and it renames the symbol 2 times. I restarted atom. it's still present. let me create a picture first.
U2LAL86AY : <https://github.com/halohalospecial/atom-elmjutsu/issues/81>
U61RNCASK : What is the best way to parse Elm in Elm at the moment? 
U601ELFEG : I know I saw the idiom of defining `(=&gt;)` to be `(,)` - can anyone remember where it is
U48AEBJQ3 : <@U601ELFEG> <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/rocket-update/latest> ?
U601ELFEG : thanks!
U23SA861Y : *hisses*
