```I had a wonderful experience! The rooms were wonderful and the staff were kind of helpful.```
have you used another service that deals with this scenario better?
Oh no
Just looking at this :confused:
lol
This is definatyely better than nothing
thats for sure
haha.. yeah - for most things (like what I'm looking to build), I think it'd be adequate.  I can deal with a false/positive error rate of 10-20%
Indeed :stuck_out_tongue:
Planning to pay with Amazon Lex in then next week or two… but lex seems like it requries a little more setup to get going then MS. <https://aws.amazon.com/lex/>
<@U2ZDLHVQD> I'd look into the IBM Watson version
I haven't played with it too much yet, but I'd start there when I get into this
Can I assume the bot_user_id returned in oauth remains the same regardless of team? Or does it change per team?
<@U3KHRQLTX> A bot is like any other user in the team, and each team has its own bot, so the bot_user_id will be different across teams.
<@U0GT29N3A> Thank you Julian, appreciate it
:wave: Hi all, I'm new to writing slack bot and was wondering, is there a way for the bot to DM a user given their userid?
i do that by using the "channel id" of the conversation between the user and bot but in my situation the user started the DM with the bot in the first place
i put channel id in quotes cuz it's not really a channel, it's a im conversation with just two people
do you go with bot.say or bot.startConversation?
cause I've been getting `throw new Error('Cannot use web API to send messages.');` errors
i would get out of java or js and goto curl commands to debug
get to the real api calls vs. getting stuck with the library u are using
but i use (ruby) `client.chat_postMessage(channel: chan, text: "wefwefw")`
I'm using botkit library, so thats in nodejs, but cool! I'll try via curl. Thanks! :smile:
chan is my case is like "D1KD59XH9" the D means direct message
I see.
Hi - I'm playing with creating chat bots for Slack and I went through the Slack-Python-Onboarding-Tutorial and everything seems to be ok, but I'm not sure how to add the app to my team.
I don't want to pollute this main channel with my ignorance, so if someone could message me and help me out for a few minutes, I'd greatly appreciate it.
Can some one help me the syntax to send message in code or text snippet mode using bot user
Bot responds `extension for Brad Z: 600, Brad Q: 606` 
Basically feed it a list of two columns. 1st column is the names that are searchable with the command and second column is the output. 
For a single command or?
<@U3MQA7NUB> Your name confused me :stuck_out_tongue:
*Confuses
<@U07CW6N3A> <@U1HK4CCRM>: Either of you happen to know what the default time interval is if my server doesn't return a 200? eg. <http://screencast.com/t/4jVZ4zdBIF> - Are we talking a retry after 1m, 3m, 5m – then no more? I could test this too if unsure, I've seen it happen a few times. Thank you
<@U3KHRQLTX> take a look at this section following that: <https://api.slack.com/events-api#graceful_retries>
With each retry attempt, you'll also be given a X-Slack-Retry-Num HTTP header indicating the attempt number: 1, 2, or 3.
<@U07CW6N3A> <@U272P5K71> Ahh, I had to scroll down a bit more. Thank you!
Exactly what I was looking for, and then some. :wink:
With Events API, I'm subscribed to im_open, message.channels, and <http://message.im|message.im>. I know when my bot gets invited to a channel and removed. Is there a way to check to see if the bot is currently in a channel, or is it best for me to track if my bots in a channel based on invite/removal messages? Or B ) use <http://channels.info|channels.info> and see if my bot user_id is in channel – members
It's hard to have an official recommendation on this... myself -- if I were writing something like this and I wanted _know_ whether I was a member of channel XYZ or not right now, I'd use `<http://channels.info|channels.info>` ad hoc to confirm that. Events API can tell you a lot and give you moment-to-moment updates, but I like the prime knowledge available in a request-and-response approach.
<@U07CW6N3A> Agree, I was leaning towards that. Appreciate it!
I have used the above example of Botkit (It's the simplest one). It's nice and I would like to present it to  my teacher but I need to get more info about  it's architecture and how it works . So, I can develop it further too. Where &amp; how can I get info about the architecture of Botkit (especially that example)?
<@U3MG3Q1FD> DM incoming
systems (Slack and the Botkit module)
i hope there is anyone who can elobarte  this to me? :slightly_smiling_face:
The docs do a pretty good job of explaining how this works and what botkit is doing. The specifics can be gleaned from reading the code.
Is there some logic to channel_ids, team_ids, user_ids (real person and bot). eg. From what I'm seeing, can I assume channel_ids that are channels will always start with C, where users/bots will start with U, and teams will start with T?
hi <@U3KHRQLTX>, there is my config
